From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The history of the UK computing industry is marked by significant mergers and consolidations, often driven by government intervention, with the aim of creating a national champion capable of competing with international giants like IBM. However, these efforts frequently led to unforeseen challenges and ultimately, the industry's decline.

## Early Consolidations and Challenges
In the punch card era, the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) and Power-Samas, a major competitor, merged in 1959 to form International Computers and Tabulators Limited (ICT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. This merger aimed to consolidate the industry, but it created a "massive headache" for BTM management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Digesting Power-Samas's mechanically-minded research and development department led to years of lost progress that could have been spent on upgrading tabulating machines to electronic computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

Following the rise of transistor-based computers like the IBM 1401, which obsoleted first-generation vacuum tube products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, UK companies faced a choice: bulk up to challenge IBM or drop out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. English Electric and ICT, the two main remaining players, acquired assets and employees from companies exiting the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
*   In 1961, ICT acquired the computer interests of GEC Computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
*   In 1962, ICT acquired the computer interests of Electrical and Musical Industries (EMI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   In 1963, ICT acquired the computer interests of Ferranti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   English Electric purchased the computer interests of Leo Computers in 1963 and Marconi in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

This wave of consolidation left both English Electric and ICT with "indigestion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Mergers, when done haphazardly, can result in a "massive mess," especially in the computer industry where merged companies had different engineering approaches, techniques, and system administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. ICT, for example, was making too many incompatible computer products, none of which were considered good except for the Ferranti Packard 6000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. This created a significant technology gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

## The Birth of ICL: A Government-Mandated Merger
The Harold Wilson government, elected in October 1964, established the Ministry of Technology (MinTech) with a primary focus on the British computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. MinTech sought to consolidate the industry to enable it to compete against American giants, especially since the UK was one of the last European strongholds where IBM did not have dominant market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. This meant merging the two largest players: English Electric and ICT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

Initial merger discussions in 1964 failed as both companies felt strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. However, after the Wilson government's re-election in 1966, they offered a "dowry" of up to £30 million to facilitate the merger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. By this time, English Electric was struggling with the high development costs of its System 4, while ICT was doing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. The firms agreed to merge in 1967, though a delay over financial arrangements reduced the government's dowry to £13.5 million due to a worsening UK economy and devaluation of the pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.

The merger finalized in July 1968, creating International Computers Limited (ICL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. ICL generated £100 million in annual revenue, employed 34,000 people, and was the world's largest non-American computer manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

### Post-Merger Challenges for ICL
ICL's mission was to rationalize its computer range, boost R&D, and compete with IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>. However, it inherited two incompatible mainframe product families: the 1900 series from ICT and the System 4 from English Electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. Political pressure from the Labour government prevented ICL from phasing out the technically outdated 1900 series, as System 4 was not a British-made product, which mattered politically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

Political interference kept ICL focused on the mainframe industry, which ultimately hastened its marginalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>. This overemphasis on expensive mainframes caused the company to completely miss the mini-computer boom of the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>. ICL also faced increasingly heavy R&D costs, particularly for writing new software for each new architecture and keeping up with the rapidly tightening cycles of [[technological_advancements_and_setbacks_in_the_british_computing_sector | semiconductor production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. The company could no longer afford the heavy R&D costs to stay competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.

## Decline and Foreign Acquisition
The 1980s brought another economic recession, further crippling ICL's sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. Facing a projected £50 million loss, ICL approached the newly elected Thatcher government for aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>. Though initially "loath to provide it," the government eventually agreed to a £200 million loan guarantee, conditional on a change in management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:26">[00:30:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>.

To manage skyrocketing R&D costs, ICL sought partnerships for [[impact_of_generational_shifts_in_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. In 1981, they struck a technology transfer deal with Fujitsu, gaining access to Fujitsu's advanced semiconductor technology (8,000 gates per chip, compared to ICL's 1,000) and future roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:38">[00:31:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>.

By 1984, ICL was taken over by British telecommunications firm Standard Telephone and Cables (STC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>. The 1981 government rescue and the Fujitsu partnership effectively ended ICL's hopes of being a national champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. The company slashed R&D, sought partnerships with outside vendors, closed manufacturing plants, and focused on sales and systems integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>. ICL evolved into a "simple assembler and distributor," sourcing cheapest components and selling them to existing clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

In 1990, Fujitsu acquired ICL, a minor shock to the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. Fujitsu eventually shut down the ICL brand for good after 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Impact of Consolidation
The downfall of ICL and the broader UK computing industry highlights several trends related to mergers and consolidation:
*   **Lack of Technical Primacy:** Despite consolidations, British companies consistently followed IBM and Japanese giants, failing to gain business leadership in their own geographic domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>.
*   **Incompatibility and "Indigestion":** Haphazard mergers led to disparate engineering approaches, techniques, and incompatible software/hardware, creating significant operational challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **The [[role_of_government_intervention_in_the_uks_computer_industry | Hollowness of National Prestige]]:** The pursuit of a "national champion" like ICL, often driven by political motivations to compete with IBM in its strongest areas (mainframe computers), led to investments in a market that was increasingly becoming irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>.
*   **Inability to Match Resources:** Even with government support, the consolidated entity could never muster the same resources as its international competitors, particularly in the face of the market splintering and the rising costs of specialized areas like [[impact_of_software_development_industry_attraction_on_semiconductor_field | software development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>. The pursuit of consolidation as a strategy for national champion status ultimately led to the industry's marginalization.

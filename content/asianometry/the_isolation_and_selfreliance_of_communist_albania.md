From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 
The People's Republic of [[the_decline_and_fall_of_communist_albania | Albania]] was often called the most isolated country in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, this small Communist nation managed to join and then split with three different major Communist powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. After its third and final split, [[economic_policies_and_challenges_under_communist_rule | Albania]] ferociously pursued economic self-reliance, which contributed to it becoming the third poorest country in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This policy shaped the [[the_decline_and_fall_of_communist_albania | rise and fall of Communist Albania]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Historical Context
Albania is a small country in Southeast Europe, about 25% smaller than Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Its mountainous, swampy, and forest-laden terrain makes it difficult to find arable land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Historically, the lands of Albania have been under foreign influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The Ottoman Turks first invaded in 1388, but were driven out by the Albanian hero Skenderbeu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. By the late 1500s, the Ottomans reoccupied the lands, ruling for another 400 years and leading to the conversion of much of the Christian population to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

In 1912, Albania was a feudal society with rich, but undeveloped, natural resources like oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Its economy was dominated by large, absent landowners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Italy gained influence over Albania through a secret treaty in 1915, which lasted for decades but contributed little to economic development beyond starting oil production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Ahmet Zogu, a landowner, became Prime Minister with Yugoslav backing, but later allied with Fascist Italy and declared himself King Zog I in 1928 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Despite clashing with Italy, Albania's economy, dependent on natural resources like oil, fell under deeper Italian influence during the 1930s economic depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## World War II and the Communist Takeover
In April 1939, Italy invaded Albania, leading King Zog I to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The Albanian people resisted, organizing into two main groups:
*   **The National Front (Nationalists)**: A disparate group of landowners who rejected Communism and sought to restore Albania's geographical integrity, leaning somewhat towards the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **The Communist Party of Albania (Albanian Party of Labor)**: Created in 1941 with the help of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia, it was led by [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Enver Hoxha]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

[[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Enver Hoxha]], a former teacher, became a Communist and quickly dominated the Central Committee of the Albanian Communist Party, eventually leading to the jailing or execution of his peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

Albania remains the only country in central or Eastern Europe to have been "liberated" without Allied help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The Communist Party, advised by the Yugoslavs, preached national liberation rather than Marxist-Leninist economic messaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. They formed the National Liberation Movement and launched guerrilla attacks, hoping for reprisals to radicalize more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

A secret agreement between Nationalists and Communists in August 1943, the Mukje agreement, quickly fell apart over the issue of an ethnic Albanian country that would include Kosovo (then part of Yugoslavia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. The Communists, backed by Yugoslavia, found this unacceptable, leading to violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The Nationalists allied with Germany, discrediting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The Communists marched into Tirana in November 1944, winning the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The war resulted in 28,000 Albanian deaths out of a population of 1 million, with widespread destruction of towns, infrastructure, agriculture, and the national economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## Consolidation of Communist Power and Early Alliances
Hoxha's provisional government swiftly purged opponents, targeting elites and anti-communists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Koci Xoxe, the Minister of the Interior, led purges that resulted in nearly 2,000 executions and imprisonment in 39 newly built jails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The Directorate of State Security (Sigurimi), Albania's secret police, had over 200,000 workers at its peak, keeping millions of files on citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

In 1945, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union recognized Hoxha's government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. In December 1945, "free" elections were held with only Communist candidates, who won 90% of the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. A month later, Hoxha abolished the monarchy and declared the country a "People's Republic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### [[albanias_relationships_with_major_communist_powers | Alliance with Yugoslavia]]
The Communist Party of Yugoslavia helped found Albania's Communist Party and provided military and governmental assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. In return, Yugoslavia pushed Albania to join the Yugoslav Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Close technical and [[economic_policies_and_challenges_under_communist_rule | economic agreements]] were signed, with Albania supplying natural resources to Yugoslavia, which then sold industrial goods back at inflated prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

By mid-1947, Yugoslavia publicly attacked Hoxha, planning to replace him with Koci Xoxe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Stalin, initially appearing to agree to Yugoslavia "swallowing" Albania, turned against Tito due to Yugoslavia's determination to acquire Albania and moves in Greece <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. In April 1948, the Soviets guaranteed they would not allow a Yugoslav attack on Albania and granted Hoxha a free hand to purge pro-Yugoslav influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This intervention saved Hoxha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Koci Xoxe was arrested, tried, and executed in 1949, marking the continuation of "liquidations" throughout Hoxha's 46-year rule, during which 5,037 men and 450 women were executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

### [[albanias_relationships_with_major_communist_powers | Alliance with the Soviet Union]]
After 1948, Albania severed ties with Yugoslavia and joined COMECON, entering the Soviet orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. From 1949 to 1951, all of Albania's trade was with COMECON states, with the Soviet Union accounting for half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. The Soviets provided approximately $200 million in food and military aid between 1948 and 1960, transferring technologies and building airfields, including a significant submarine base on Sazan island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

Hoxha showed immense personal admiration for Stalin, publishing a book about their meetings, depicting Stalin as warm and kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Regardless of personal feelings, Hoxha was genuine in his fervor for a Stalinist economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

### [[economic_policies_and_challenges_under_communist_rule | Stalinist Economic Policies]]
Going Stalinist meant building a completely centrally-planned socialist economy, with the government deciding all aspects of economic decision-making through 5-year plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Policy emphasized collectivization of agriculture and rapid build-up of heavy industry at the cost of consumer products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

Collectivization progressed slowly due to limited arable land, but by 1956, 696 collective farms covered 40% of the land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. By 1951, Albania transitioned to a centrally planned economy with its first 5-Year Plan, which set all prices, production levels, investment, and wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. This Stalinist-style economy led to strange contradictions and shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. Employment was guaranteed, but job choice was absent, and failure to meet goals led to labor camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Despite new factories and luxury goods in stores, food was scarce, and rationing continued until 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

## Break with the Soviet Union
Stalin's death in 1953 brought Nikita Khrushchev to power, whose new policies grated on Hoxha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. Khrushchev's repudiation of the Stalin cult of personality, institution of collective leadership, and policy of "different paths to socialism" — culminating in a 1956 reconciliation with Marshal Tito — were unacceptable to Hoxha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

As early as October 1954, Albania began moving towards the People's Republic of China, which also beefed with Khrushchev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. After Hoxha met Mao Zedong in September 1956, Chinese aid to Albania increased significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

As the Sino-Soviet Split widened, Albania's break with the Soviets became inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. In November 1960, Hoxha criticized Khrushchev in Moscow, leading to four unresolved meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. In February 1961, Hoxha launched an economic campaign against Soviet advice, pledging loyalty only on his own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. The Soviets, infuriated, withdrew their considerable aid (50% of Albania's economy from 1946 to 1961) in April 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

At the Soviet Communist Party Congress in October 1961, Khrushchev called Hoxha an "unreconstructed Stalinist" and accused him of sabotaging the Soviet-Albanian relationship, arguing that Hoxha did not want to extinguish the cult of personality because it meant giving up personal power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.

> They apparently expect in this manner to clear the ground for winning the right to receive hand-outs from the imperialists. The imperialists are always prepared to pay thirty pieces of silver to those who split the Communist ranks. But pieces of silver have never brought anyone anything but dishonor and shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>

Stunned, the Albanians fired back, calling Khrushchev a "revisionist" and "anti-Marxist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. In November 1961, Hoxha delivered a fiery speech in Albania, reiterating his accusations against Khrushchev:

> Our people have a saying, "The fish rots from its head." That’s what happened in the Soviet Union! Revisionism emerged in its head ... and spread throughout its whole body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>

Hoxha also denounced de-Stalinization, calling Stalin a true follower of Lenin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. In response to Khrushchev's "pieces of silver" barb, Hoxha famously declared:

> The Albanian people and their Party of Labor will even live on grass if need be, but they will never sell themselves "for 30 pieces of silver" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>

Consequently, the Soviet Union and its allies expelled Albania from the Warsaw Pact and COMECON, leaving China as its only significant ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. Khrushchev remarked, "It is true that we lost Albania, but what you've won is nothing much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.

### [[albanias_relationships_with_major_communist_powers | Alliance with China]]
China attempted to replace Soviet aid, sending technicians and advisors whom Albanians received favorably due to less strict loan terms and comparable salaries to average Albanians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. Mao Zedong called Albania "the only beacon of true socialism left in Europe" and promised Chinese support against any attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

However, China was a developing country experiencing one of history's worst famines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. Geographical distance also caused delays, such as a year and a half for textile plant machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. Chinese aid struggled to replace Soviet support, making the Third Five-Year Plan (1961-1965) one of the most challenging periods for Communist Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. To maintain power, Hoxha tightened his surveillance state (Sigurimi) and ramped up his own cult of personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

## Break with China and Total Self-Reliance
The Sino-Albanian "love affair" ended when China began overtures to the West in 1969, which drove a wedge between the two nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. Nixon's announced trip to China in July 1971 shocked the Albanians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. China also secretly informed Albania that aid would not continue indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. Hoxha condemned Nixon and purged high-ranking officials for pro-Chinese leanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. When Tito was invited to Beijing in 1977, Albania considered it an embarrassing loss of face and escalated rhetorical attacks on China, calling them collaborators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. In July 1978, Deng Xiaoping cut off all aid to Albania, which then accounted for half of the country's economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

### The Policy of Self-Reliance
As shortages intensified in the mid-1960s, the Party focused on the concept of self-reliance, a fundamental Stalinist concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. After cutting ties with China, the Albanian government convinced its people they were special and exploited by imperialist foreign powers through "economic blockades and encirclement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

Hoxha declared Albania the only country left building socialism and revamped the Constitution in 1976 to enshrine self-reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. For the next 12 years, Albania went it alone, refusing foreign aid or credit, and prohibiting joint ventures with foreign countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. Hoxha gained unlimited power, his cult of personality reaching new heights, being called the "father of the nation" and a "second Skenderbeu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. Religion was banned, and people were forbidden from traveling abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

#### [[economic_policies_and_challenges_under_communist_rule | Economic Isolation]]
Key aspects of this policy included:
1.  **Ramped-up exports**: To acquire hard currency for investment goods, Albania focused on four major goods: oil, chrome ore (chromite), copper, and electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. Trade partners were diversified, including a semi-relaxation of relations with Yugoslavia and COMECON (excluding the Soviet Union) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
2.  **Controlled economic data**: The Central Committee received all data, releasing only positive figures while carefully controlling the rest as state secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.
3.  **Food self-sufficiency**: Albania drained swamps to expand arable land from 391,000 hectares in 1950 to 713,000 in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. In 1976, Albania declared self-sufficiency in bread grain, considered perhaps the policy's greatest achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

## Stagnation and the [[the_decline_and_fall_of_communist_albania | Fall of Communism]]
Towards the end of his life, [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Enver Hoxha]], suffering from heart attacks and diabetes, chose Ramiz Alia as his successor in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. Hoxha purged his long-time partner, Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu, in this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. Alia gained decision-making power, largely adhering to Hoxha's economic isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>. In 1983, an aged Hoxha declared victory, claiming significant economic achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. He spent his final years writing memoirs, unaware of the impending economic disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. Hoxha died in April 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

Initially, economic numbers seemed to support Hoxha's claims, with a reported trade surplus and no foreign debt by 1983, unique for Eastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. However, around this time, Albania entered deep and prolonged [[soviet_economic_stagnation_and_need_for_reform | economic stagnation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. Throughout the 1980s, the economy grew at an average of 1.7%, effectively zeroed out in the second half of the decade, meaning the average Albanian grew poorer due to a 2% population growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

The immediate causes of stagnation included a five-year drought (1983-1988) affecting agricultural output and hydropower, which was crucial for chromite mining and export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. A massive global oil glut simultaneously crashed petro-prices, hurting another major economic pillar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. Oil production fell far short of targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. Equipment from the Soviets and Chinese became obsolete and broken, and due to self-reliance, engineers attempted costly repairs instead of buying new machinery from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

The people suffered significantly, with severe rationing of meat, butter, and eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. The average monthly wage in 1984 was $15, and people could not even keep their own livestock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>. Even in Tirana, water and electricity were only available for a few hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. Living conditions were cramped, and technology was decades behind, as recalled by a German visitor in 1984:

> At night, the town was in total darkness. There were no cars. We saw only a few trucks, most of them broken down. Some people were trying to repair them ... the roads were in a sorry state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>
> We went to a place where they had an exhibition of Albanian technology. When we entered, we saw an Enver Hoxha tractor. Our friend from Mercedes-Benz had a look at it and said, ‘Yes, yes. We used to make these back in 1920.’ The technology on display there was indeed from the 1920s. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>

Anyone attempting to leave was shot on sight, and jamming devices were installed to prevent foreign influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. The border was laced with barbed wire, and 64% of the coasts were designated military zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. In 45 years, about 1,200 people, mostly under 30, were killed trying to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

Self-reliance led to economic stagnation and decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. After Hoxha's death, Alia attempted gradual economic changes, slowly backing away from self-reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. He made quiet outreaches to the West, establishing diplomatic relations, reducing death penalty offenses, and relaxing travel restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. However, these reforms were insufficient as the Secret Police lost its grip, and other Communist governments in Eastern Europe collapsed by 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.

In July 1990, thousands occupied Western embassies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. Massive protests and violence erupted in Tirana, leading to looting of schools, hospitals, and collective farms, further damaging the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. Industrial output in Q3 1991 was 60% lower than the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>. Alia's final attempts at reform failed, and he called for free elections instead of using force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. People tore down Hoxha's statues, and in March 1992, the Democratic Party won power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>.

Albania's pursuit of total economic "self-reliance" led the country down a path of anti-development and into extreme poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. After 1992, Albania underwent one of the fastest transitions to capitalism, though a profound need for further economic reform remains today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.

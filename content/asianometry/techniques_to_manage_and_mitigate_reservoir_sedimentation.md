Each year, the world loses 1-2% of its [[river_silt_and_sediment_impact_on_hydropower | hydropower capacity]] to river silt and sediment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. [[consequences_of_reservoir_silting | Silting]] gradually reduces a dam's ability to store drinking water, generate power, and provide flood protection, necessitating costly preventive measures and interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Many reservoirs worldwide face this constant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Understanding Reservoir Sedimentation

Rivers carry two types of sediment:
*   **Coarse sediment** refers to sands and gravels, primarily originating from the riverbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Fine-grained sediment** consists of smaller particles, approximately two millimeters wide, which can come from the riverbed or from clay and silt washed into the river by rains or human activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The total amount of sediment carried by rivers is measured as "sediment yield," typically expressed in tons per unit time per unit area (e.g., tons per year per square kilometer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

When a river is dammed to create a reservoir, its natural flow of sediment transport is interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. River sediments begin to settle within the reservoir, gradually filling it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This process, known as reservoir sedimentation or silting, leads to a reduction in the reservoir's water-holding capacity, a situation referred to as "dead storage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Factors Affecting Sedimentation
While silting eventually affects every reservoir, some are more impacted than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. For instance, Taiwan's reservoirs are heavily affected due to [[impact_of_geography_and_weather_on_reservoir_silting | its mountainous geography with loose soils]] and frequent typhoon storms that bring long rainstorms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. These rains wash loose soils into rivers, significantly increasing sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. For example, Typhoon Morakot in 2009 deposited an estimated 90 million cubic meters of sediment into Taiwan's largest reservoir, the Zengwen Reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Australia also faced significant siltation, with over 20 dams becoming fully silted between 1890 and 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The highest rates of siltation occurred during large floods that followed major droughts, which dams were often ill-equipped to handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Strategies for Mitigating Reservoir Sedimentation
[[historical_and_modern_engineering_solutions_for_siltation | Strategies for dealing with reservoir siltation]] generally fall into three categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>:

### 1. Sediment Yield Reduction
This approach focuses on reducing the amount of sediment flowing into reservoirs in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The primary cause of high sediment yields is upstream soil erosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

*   **Preventing Soil Erosion:** Soil erosion is often human-caused, particularly when poorer farmers cultivate sloping, deforested lands, making them vulnerable to rains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
    *   **Reduced Tillage:** Minimizing the amount of soil turned over and disturbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   **Protective Cover:** Protecting denuded soil with mulch, cover crops, or vegetation like vetiver grass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   **Terracing:** An ancient method that involves turning slopes into flat steps with dikes to prevent water from washing away soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

    Despite the existence of hundreds of helpful methods, a significant challenge is the vast size and complex governance of many watershed areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. However, hard work can pay off; siltation rates in Australia significantly declined after the 1950s due to new farming techniques and land conservation methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

*   **Buffer Reservoirs:** Creating upstream buffer reservoirs can trap sediment before it reaches the main dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
    *   **Large-scale Example:** The 39 major dams along South America's Paraná River, including the massive Itaipu Dam, inadvertently serve as sediment traps for the larger Yacyretá hydropower dam downstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
    *   **Small-scale Example:** In Central Texas, the construction of numerous farm ponds along river tributaries led to a 55% decline in sediment yield in the watershed, improving local reservoir siltation rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### 2. Sediment Routing
Sediment routing involves tactics to prevent sediment from accumulating at the reservoir's bottom by moving it around or through the reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

*   **Pass-through (Sluicing):** This prominent tactic involves drawing down the reservoir to discharge muddy water and impound clean water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This requires substantial reservoir drawdown for weeks or even months and dams designed with outlets capable of handling this flushing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Many of China's large dams, like the Yellow River's Sanmenxia Dam, employ this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Sediment Bypass Tunnels:** These tunnels route sediment entirely around a dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. They are more suited for medium-sized dams where normal pass-throughs might be less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. A key advantage is that they do not require flushing the reservoir's water levels and allow the river's natural water flow to continue, offering ecological benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Switzerland pioneered bypass tunnels in the 1970s, and Japan has implemented them for its dams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### 3. Sediment Removal
Despite routing tactics, silt and sediment will eventually enter a dam, necessitating removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This can be done through dry excavation or dredging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

*   **Dry Excavation:** This invasive and costly effort involves dewatering the reservoir (which can take up to a year) to allow conventional equipment to excavate the sediment slurry and transport it elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Costs vary significantly; in 1993, dry excavation by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works ranged from $5 to $30 per square meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Dredging:** This commonly practiced method involves removing sediment from the bottom of rivers or reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
    *   **Hydraulic Dredging:** Sediment is mixed with water and then pumped out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
    *   **Mechanical Dredging:** Machines with clam shells or buckets dig up the sediment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
    Dredging is expensive and often reserved for large projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. In Taiwan, despite a cumulative $160 million spent on dredging the Zengwen Reservoir, high sediment yields have only allowed the restoration of 8% of its total capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

*   **Underwater Explosions:** Engineers have proposed using underwater explosions to loosen sediment deposits, making them easier to flush or dredge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
    *   **Taiwanese Experiment (2018):** Taiwanese civil engineers experimented with this method at the critical Zengwen Reservoir in the south, which provides 40% of the area's water needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Because the reservoir's water cannot be flushed out, they combine mechanical dredging (up to 2 million cubic meters annually, reaching 8-10 meters deep) with dynamite blasting to reach more impacted sediment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. To protect aquatic life, they used underwater speakers, black pepper powder, and an air bubble curtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Experiments showed that blasting could create 20-meter wide craters or loosen a 10-meter layer of sediment for six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. It was calculated that blasting could free up an additional 15% of reservoir capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Historical Context and Ongoing Maintenance
Engineers have been addressing reservoir siltation since ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. For example, the 1,700-year-old Roman Monte Novo Dam was equipped with two outlets for flushing sedimented water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. However, societies sometimes forget or lose the ability to maintain these structures, leading to consequences such as abandoned silted reservoirs, like the 1,800-year-old Roman-built Harbaka Dam in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Dams, while seemingly invincible, are human-built infrastructure that require continuous effort to maintain their effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

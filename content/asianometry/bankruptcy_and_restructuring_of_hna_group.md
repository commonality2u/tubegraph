From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

At its zenith, China's [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]] managed an estimated $170 billion in assets globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The conglomerate held significant shares in Deutsche Bank and Hilton Hotels, owned airports and real estate in Germany, China, and the United States, and operated the world's third-largest aircraft leasing business with over 900 planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Most of this growth occurred within just a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. By May 2017, [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] was undertaking at least one multi-million or billion-dollar transaction monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, this rapid expansion quickly led to a dramatic downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Aggressive Financial Strategies
From its inception, [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] employed aggressive and opaque [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna | financial strategies]] to fund its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Initial startup capital for Hainan Provincial Airlines (the predecessor to [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]]) was 10 million RMB from the Hainan government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Recognizing this was insufficient, co-founder Chen Feng and his team convinced the local government to restructure the business as a joint stock company, allowing it to sell shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This raised 250 million RMB (approximately $35 million USD) from 122 stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

A key borrowing tactic involved exploiting the lack of sophistication in early Chinese banking. [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] would secure loans for a plane, but the Chinese banks assigned property rights to [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]], enabling them to remortgage the same plane to another bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Additionally, they borrowed against future revenue streams from the plane's air routes, effectively mortgaging each plane twice: once as a hard asset and again with its future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This "one plane, two loan" approach allowed [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] to double its leverage and grow rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The long loan terms (10-15 years) provided time, but often, the only way to repay one loan was to take out another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Government Bailouts and Opaque Structures
Despite its rapid expansion, [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] faced early financial crises. The 2003 SARS epidemic caused a massive loss of 1.5 billion RMB, pushing the company close to bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. The Hainan provincial government, despite its small financial stake, bailed out [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] in 2005 with an injection of 1.5 billion RMB, representing 10% of its entire revenue that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

The 2008 Global Financial Crisis also resulted in a 1.73 billion RMB loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Again, the Hainan provincial government provided another 1.5 billion RMB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The company also benefited from the Chinese government's 4 trillion RMB stimulus package in November 2008, which caused land prices to skyrocket, including 9,000 acres of land [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] owned in Haikou <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This land's immense value allowed [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] to sell 4 billion RMB of bonds and 2.8 billion RMB of stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

[[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]]'s ownership structure was notoriously opaque. At its IPO, co-founders Chen Feng and Wang Jian held minuscule personal stakes but controlled a shell company that was the second-largest shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. From 2002 to 2015, a Hainan Airlines Trade Union was the controlling shareholder, later replaced by a non-profit called the Hainan Tahang Charity Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This foundation, despite its stated anti-poverty mission, appeared to be a "stealth vehicle" for Chen Feng to control the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Global Acquisition Spree and Debt Structure
Undeterred by close calls, [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] embraced the post-2008 recession to acquire cheap overseas targets, launching its "Super X plan" with the goal of accumulating 1 trillion RMB ($148 billion USD) in assets within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. From late 2010 to 2017, [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] spent billions on hotels, tech companies, real estate, and airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. The frenzy peaked between 2015 and 2017, with $50 billion spent on 123 [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna | acquisitions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

The vast majority of these [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna | acquisitions]] were financed through borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] shifted from mortgaging planes to mortgaging land development projects and other hard assets across China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. They partnered with indebted provincial and city governments on infrastructure projects, leasing assets to help these governments bypass their debt limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] would then spin off these projects into publicly traded subsidiaries, whose skyrocketing net asset values and stock prices allowed [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] management to pledge shares for even more loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

[[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] developed a super complex capital structure, evolving into an intertwined web of Chinese-based investment entities, including 10 publicly traded companies on Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets, and seven on Hong Kong markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. As [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] acquired companies or stakes, they injected these [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna | acquisitions]] into their complex web, then remortgaged them for more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. The intricate web of stock and debt ownership made it difficult to determine who owned what, resembling a "Portuguese man of war" â€“ an agglomeration of smaller creatures that clump together, consuming anything in their path, but entirely dependent on external currents for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

## Regulatory Scrutiny and the Beginning of the End
The "party" of rapid [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna | acquisitions]] ended in May 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. In mid-May 2017, [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] issued $500 million in bonds for its 245 Park Avenue purchase, one of its last overseas M&A financing transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. On June 22, 2017, the China Banking Regulatory Commission ordered several banks to conduct risk checks on the overseas borrowing and investing activities of [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] and other conglomerates like Anbang and Dalian Wanda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

This government intervention rapidly changed the situation:
*   **July 2017**: An [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] subsidiary, Sherco, canceled its planned purchase of Global Eagle Entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   **July 2017**: Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Bank of America stopped accepting shares of [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]] companies as pledges for new loans, with Goldman Sachs following suit in September 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   **September 2017**: The Hong Kong Monetary Authority requested financial information from [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   **November 2017**: [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] issued $300 million in bonds at an extremely high interest rate of 8.875%, China's highest ever for its class, indicating rising yields on [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   **November 2017**: The Chinese central government criticized [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]]'s core Sanya new airport reclamation project for "suspected illegal use of the sea," shaking confidence in the company's perceived government connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>.

## Revealed Debt and Downgrades
In late November 2017, [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] reported its financial data, revealing an estimated current loan balance of 637 billion RMB ($94 billion USD), a 36% increase from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. Including unlisted subsidiaries, estimates for total debt reached as high as 1 trillion RMB ($148 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. This made [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]] Asia's most indebted company, leading Standard & Poor's and other credit rating agencies to downgrade its debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.

## Restructuring Efforts and Tragedy
January 2018 marked the beginning of reversals. [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] management met with creditors, announcing plans to unwind its expansion and return to its core airline business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. They committed to selling 100 billion RMB of assets in the first half of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. A third of [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]]'s publicly traded affiliates had their shares suspended, including [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] Tourism Service Business, Bohai Leasing, Tianjin Tianhai, Hainan Airlines Holdings, and CCOOP Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>. For some, [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] had pledged up to 60% of total shares in circulation for loans, a key source of cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

Throughout 2018, [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] began selling off assets acquired only a year earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. This rapid sell-off occurred amidst a personal tragedy: in July 2018, Wang Jian, co-founder and the "inside man" running day-to-day operations, died in a fall in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. His 15% stake passed to the American non-profit that controlled the majority of [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. Chen Feng's son, Chen Xiaofeng, was appointed the new Deputy CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

Assets slowly melted away:
*   Two plots from the Kai Tak airport site in Hong Kong were sold for $2 billion, a rare recorded gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.
*   Part of the stake in Deutsche Bank began selling off in 2019 and continues today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
*   Swissport was swapped to its senior creditors in August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
*   The massive Ingram Micro IT subsidiary was sold to Platinum Equity in December 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.

## Final Collapse and Aftermath
Despite these efforts, the devastating impact of COVID-19 on [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]]'s core airline and travel businesses triggered a final crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. On February 2021, [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA]] officially entered bankruptcy proceedings, acknowledging $170 billion in debts from creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. The company is expected to be split into four businesses after bankruptcy procedures are complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.

In September 2021, Chen Feng and his chief executive, Adam Tan, were detained by the Chinese government for suspected crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.

The collapse of [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group]] underscores the dangers of its opaque, debt-fueled expansion. While some speculated that its rapid growth and extensive borrowing implied close government backing, an equally strong argument suggests that the company's complex structure was designed to dodge oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>.

India's nuclear program has a complex history, evolving from an early stance against nuclear weapons to becoming a declared nuclear power. This journey was influenced by its own scientific ambitions, international relations, and regional security concerns.

## Early Stance and Foundation
Initially, India was a leading voice for [[indias_advocacy_for_a_nuclear_weapon_ban_and_its_early_nuclear_stance | a global ban on nuclear weapons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Mahatma Gandhi described nuclear weapons in 1947 as a "sinful and diabolical use of science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, voiced concerns after the Japanese atomic bombings that the bomb might become a weapon "only for killing Asians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Despite wishing for a world without nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, India detonated its first device on May 18, 1974, becoming the sixth declared nuclear power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The origins of India's atomic program are deeply tied to [[role_of_dr_homi_bhabha_in_indias_nuclear_development | Dr. Homi Bhabha]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Born into a prominent Parsi family, Bhabha earned a PhD in physics from Cambridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Stranded in India during World War II, Bhabha saw an opportunity to transform his new country by helping it overcome its colonial past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Creating TIFR
In March 1944, Bhabha proposed a "vigorous school of research" to the philanthropic Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, asking for funds to establish a world-class science institution in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This led to the founding of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. TIFR, generously funded, became the "cradle of Indiaâ€™s atomic energy program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## The Race for Ores
A key [[challenges_of_acquiring_nuclear_materials_in_india | early challenge for India's nuclear history]] was securing and controlling thorium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. India has abundant thorium, which can be converted into fissile uranium-233 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The Travancore principality, rich in rare earth ores like monazite (containing thorium), became a crucial source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Despite a deal for monazite access with the British in January 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, the Indian government, including Nehru, put significant pressure on Travancore to join the union, eventually securing India's nuclear ores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Atomic Energy Commission of India
In 1948, Nehru proposed establishing the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) of India, with Bhabha as its chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The AEC enjoyed substantial protection, with Bhabha directly reporting to Nehru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Nehru was primarily interested in nuclear science for its potential to accelerate India's development and prestige, seeing it as crucial for energy and industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Publicly, Nehru opposed nuclear weapons but wanted to keep the option open, granting Bhabha the autonomy to build the necessary infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Finding Partners
India leveraged its strategic minerals to gain technological assistance. Agreements with France in 1948 and 1950 included a monazite processing plant and joint research on beryllium-moderated reactors, marking the first bilateral international nuclear project after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

In 1952, Bhabha sought declassified reactor information and heavy water from the US Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) chairman Gordon Dean, offering thorium or uranium in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Despite frosty relations due to India's non-alignment policy, the US was interested in securing strategic nuclear ores to deny them to Communist countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. A notable incident in July 1953 involved an Indian state-owned enterprise shipping thorium nitrate to China, causing a diplomatic scramble and forcing the US to buy the thorium at a high price to avoid terminating aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Pakistan's growing ties with the US further deepened India's antipathy towards America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Criticism
The AEC's power was not without critics. Indian astrophysicist Meghnad Saha, who became a politician, openly criticized the AEC's lack of results, transparency, and its close ties to private enterprises like the Tata Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Saha, aligned with the Soviet Union, argued that India was wasting resources by focusing too much on theoretical atomic development rather than practical applications and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. This public scrutiny pushed the AEC to demonstrate concrete results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Atoms for Peace
A significant shift occurred in December 1953 when Dwight Eisenhower delivered his "Atoms for Peace" speech at the UN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. This initiative aimed to present a more favorable image of atomic energy, pre-empt Soviet entry into the nuclear export market, and prepare the world for the eventual use of nuclear weapons in warfare (part of Eisenhower's "New Look" defense strategy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. "Atoms for Peace" reversed previous policies of secrecy, opening doors to commercial competition in atomic energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. While promoting peaceful uses, it downplayed non-proliferation dangers, recognizing the dual-use nature of nuclear power and weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. India's atomic program directly and greatly benefited from this duality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

## A Three Step Plan
In response to public criticism, Nehru asked the AEC to hold a national conference in November 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. At this "Conference on the Development of Atomic Energy for Peaceful Purposes," Bhabha presented a three-step plan for India's nuclear program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>:
1.  **Step One**: Build natural uranium-fueled atomic reactors with foreign assistance, producing plutonium as a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
2.  **Step Two**: Build new reactors fueled by a mix of thorium and plutonium from the first stage, producing uranium-233 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
3.  **Step Three**: Mix uranium-233 with India's abundant thorium to feed "breeder" reactors, creating an essentially unlimited supply of nuclear fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

Bhabha's plan emphasized national independence and strategic optionality, leveraging India's thorium reserves, and giving India the option to build nuclear weapons through plutonium production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Nehru fully supported the plan, increasing the program's budget twelve-fold by 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

## The Swimming Pool (Apsara)
In June 1954, Bhabha contacted Sir John Cockcroft, head of the [[history_of_british_nuclear_energy_development | UK's Atomic Energy Authority]], for heavy water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Although heavy water wasn't available, Cockcroft offered technical drawings and 6 kilograms of enriched fuel rods for a "swimming pool" type research reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. In return, India promised special consideration for future reactor purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

This 1-megawatt reactor, named "Apsara," first went live in August 1956, becoming Asia's first nuclear reactor outside the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. Nehru, at its inauguration in January 1957, emphasized that Apsara was "almost entirely" the work of young Indian scientists and builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. Apsara was decommissioned in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

## Canada (CIRUS)
At the first Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva in August 1955, where Bhabha served as president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, Canada proposed transferring one of their research reactors to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. The final agreement led to Canada building the 40-megawatt heavy water reactor, the Canadian-Indian Reactor, US (CIRUS), covering all foreign exchange costs ($14 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. The "US" in the name came from the United States providing 21 tons of heavy water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

Canada initially requested that the fuel be held in international custody, but Bhabha strongly rejected this, asserting India's "inalienable right to hold its own fuel" and criticizing international safeguards for creating atomic "haves" and "have-nots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. Consequently, Canada placed no strict restrictions, only a promise to use the reactor for peaceful purposes, with no inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. CIRUS began operations in 1960 and reached full capacity in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

### CIRUS
CIRUS's design encouraged the production of large amounts of weapons-grade plutonium, as it allowed for the quick removal and replacement of uranium fuel rods while operational, preventing the formation of non-weapon-grade plutonium isotopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. Canada's "peaceful" nuclear program later faced criticism as similar reactors contributed to nuclear weapons proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. The US also funded a nuclear power plant in Tarapur, India, with few safeguards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

## Phoenix
Simultaneously, India built a plutonium reprocessing plant called Phoenix in Trombay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. This plant, which could extract plutonium from spent nuclear fuel like that from CIRUS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>, was indigenously built with assistance from American company Vitro International <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. Such a transfer would be impossible today, as regulators at the time did not understand its significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.

By 1962, India technically had the pathway to a nuclear weapon, knowing it could scrape together enough weapons-grade plutonium within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. This timing likely influenced the 1962 Atomic Energy Act, which Nehru hastily passed to lock down information about the nuclear program and grant the government rights to mine and seize land for nuclear development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. When Phoenix went live in June 1964, India knew it was about a year away from having the 5-10 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium needed for a test bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

## Hesitancy
Despite having the materials for a bomb by 1965, India's actual production was delayed for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. Nehru and other influential groups opposed immediate weaponization, choosing to keep options open but hesitating to build the weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.

## China and Pakistan
The Sino-Indian border clashes escalating in summer 1962, which blew up into the Sino-Indian War on October 20, 1962, were a humiliating national loss for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. This motivated India to improve its defense capacity, doubling its military budget in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. For the first time, a political party, the right-wing Jana Sangh Party, publicly demanded that India build the Bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

Despite this, Nehru did not move forward with the bomb, stating that doing so would show "utter insincerity" to India's long-held stance against nuclear tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. He continued to support the atomic program to keep options open, but maintained his belief that atomic bombs would not help India's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. Nehru passed away in May 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

His successor, Lal Bahadur Shastri, immediately faced threats from Pakistan and [[chinas_indigenous_nuclear_weapon_development | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. Pakistan's military aid from the US and its deepening ties with China, including a border delineation in December 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>, agitated India. The imminent [[chinas_indigenous_nuclear_weapon_development | Chinese nuclear weapons]] test, publicly announced by the Americans in September 1964 and confirmed by the actual test on October 16, 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>, deeply impacted India's political class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. The fact that the [[soviet_assistance_in_chinas_nuclear_program | Soviets started helping them]] since 1958 made it inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.

## The Debate
[[role_of_dr_homi_bhabha_in_indias_nuclear_development | Dr. Bhabha]] actively pushed for India to build the bomb, publicly stating in London on October 4, 1964 (12 days before the Chinese test) that India was "just 18 months away from a nuclear weapon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

After the Chinese test, the Jana Sangh party escalated its rhetoric for a bomb, criticizing the "eunuch Government" for not developing it before China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. A survey of Indian elites by the Indian Express indicated belief in Bhabha's 18-month claim (though likely an exaggeration) but urged against rushing into a nuclear program due to the immense costs amid rising inflation and food shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. Bhabha attempted to downplay the costs, claiming 50 atomic bombs would cost only $21 million, but this excluded infrastructure and delivery systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

Many in the ruling Congress Party disputed the relevance of [[chinas_indigenous_nuclear_weapon_development | China's nuclear weapons]] to India, viewing them as directed at superpowers and a challenge to the nuclear monopoly, not India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. Shastri prioritized solving the ongoing food shortage crisis, advocating a non-bomb policy and possibly a nuclear umbrella from the West, while also mentioning a program for "peaceful purposes" nuclear explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.

## The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965
The intense Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 brought the threat of Pakistan back to the forefront in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. During the conflict, China, backing Pakistan, threatened nuclear retaliation if India didn't halt its progress, though China eventually backed down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>. The US halting military exports to both India and Pakistan destroyed trust in a Western nuclear umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. These events fueled domestic calls for India to build its own bomb, as it could only depend on itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

Amidst political turmoil, Shastri died suddenly in January 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. Indira Gandhi, Nehru's daughter, became Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. On the same day, [[role_of_dr_homi_bhabha_in_indias_nuclear_development | Dr. Bhabha]] died in a plane crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>. These deaths left a massive void in India's nuclear policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

## Dual Policy
Gandhi appointed Vikram Sarabhai to take over many of Bhabha's posts, including secretary of the Department of Atomic Energy, which managed the sprawling atomic programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>. By this time, the world generally presumed an Indian nuclear weapon was imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. A US study in March 1966 concluded that India would detonate a bomb within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.

It is likely that Shastri and Bhabha initiated a peaceful nuclear explosion program in 1964 after the Chinese detonation, though Bhabha's death stalled it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>. In 1968, scientists at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) began work on a practical implosion-type plutonium bomb design, initiated by AEC chairperson Homi Sethna, who had led work on Project Phoenix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.

Sarabhai, nominally Sethna's boss, disliked nuclear weapons and advocated for nuclear reactor expansion for civilian benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. Sethna, however, favored a peaceful nuclear detonation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. Sarabhai did not stop the effort, and his death in December 1971 removed the last significant political obstacle to a nuclear explosion test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.

## The Explosion
The nuclear bomb's basic design was completed in late 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. In January 1972, BARC technical teams began preliminary work on assembling the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. In September 1972, Homi Sethna received formal approval from Indira Gandhi to finalize the device and find a test site for a potential underground peaceful nuclear explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>. A key milestone occurred in March 1973 when the detonation system confirmed implosion was possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

The chosen test site was the Thar desert in Rajasthan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>. The 61 Engineer Regiment of the Indian Army was ordered to dig an underground shaft for a "seismic experiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. They initially refused until Chief of Army staff G. G. Bewoor personally conveyed Prime Minister Gandhi's direct order in October 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. An accidental aquifer hit in January 1974 delayed the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.

The shaft was completed in early May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:45">[00:34:45]</a>. After a heated discussion, Gandhi decided to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>. The explosion occurred on May 18, 1974, at 8:05 AM local time, delayed five minutes by a faulty Jeep engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>.

### Gandhi's Motivation
Indira Gandhi took the final step to detonation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. Her motivations remain somewhat inscrutable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>. Raja Ramanna, who led the technical team, recalled that "She didn't speak in the meetings. She listened and then decided" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. Gandhi herself stated that the Peaceful Nuclear Explosion was done "simply...when we were ready" to "show to ourselves we could do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>. She denied it was political, citing no upcoming elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

India did not conduct another detonation after this first one, nor did it immediately develop delivery systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:30">[00:36:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>. Peaceful Nuclear Explosions were in vogue globally, with the US and Soviets having conducted at least 70 combined detonations before India's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>. The lack of official information has, however, led to speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>.

## Circumstances
The detonation occurred during a period of strained US-India relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. During the 1971 Indo-Pakistani War, US President Nixon ordered the nuclear-powered USS Enterprise into the Bay of Bengal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>. While Nixon's intent was to dissuade Chinese intervention, some in the Indian government, including Gandhi, perceived this as nuclear intimidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>. The timing of the detonation effort, starting in early 1972 after the Enterprise's arrival, lends credence to this speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.

Nixon's groundbreaking overtures to [[chinas_indigenous_nuclear_weapon_development | China]], culminating in his 1972 visit, also likely made India uneasy about improving US-China relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>. Domestically, despite Gandhi's claims, the detonation was very popular and consolidated her political power at a time of rising opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.

## Conclusion
Regardless of the precise reasoning, the 1974 Indian nuclear explosion had profound effects on non-proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. India was the first country to use civilian nuclear energy technology to make a bomb, leading to new international efforts to control nuclear technology to prevent similar occurrences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. The international backlash, especially from Canada, surprised Indian scientists and the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>. Consequently, India did not conduct another peaceful nuclear explosion, and it would be two decades before they started producing actual nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>. Nevertheless, India asserted its right to the Bomb as a Great Power, a stance that remained consistent throughout its program's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.

By 1986, the Soviet Union possessed just over 10,000 computers, a stark contrast to America's 1.3 million [00:00:01]. While the Soviet Union was the world's third most proficient computing power at the time of Stalin's death, by the 1960s, the computing gap with the U.S. was already measured in years [00:00:10]. Two decades later, this gap was undeniable and seemingly permanent [00:00:20].

Despite the Soviet state's belief in science and industrial modernization, abundant support for research and development in hard sciences, and having top minds capable of launching Sputnik and landing on Venus, the question remains: why did this disparity occur [00:00:26]?

## Early Development and Initial Successes

News of the ENIAC, the first general-purpose programmable computer built in the United States, reached the Soviet Union in 1948 [00:00:44]. Although initial reactions dismissed it as propaganda due to limited knowledge of its vacuum tube technology, the Soviets noted the significant Western investment in the field [00:00:54]. The Soviet government urgently needed to improve calculating workflows; for example, the nuclear weapons program relied on over 100 "calculator girls" performing daily eight-hour shifts of pure calculations [00:01:10]. Concerns arose about finding enough personnel to perform error-free complex calculations like differential equations [00:01:24].

In 1948, the Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Technology (ITMVT) was established within the Soviet Academy of Sciences to explore computing [00:01:39]. However, ITMVT's initial efforts focused on mechanical analog calculating machines [00:01:52]. This direction was influenced by its director, Nikolai Brevich, who believed reliable electronic general computers were impossible in the near future [00:01:58]. Voicing dissent during the Stalin era was dangerous, but a new development in Ukraine offered an alternative path [00:02:10].

Sergey Lebedev, director of the Kiev Electrotechnical Institute in Ukraine, learned about American digital computer efforts in 1948 [00:02:26]. Lebedev, an electrical engineer and World War II hero, developed the "Maly Electrono-Vychislitelnaya Mashina" or MESM, ironically named given its 6,000 vacuum tubes and 60 square meters footprint [00:02:36]. In December 1951, MESM successfully solved its first real calculation for an artillery weapons table, requiring 250,000 calculations over two and a half hours [00:03:12]. This device impressed top political leaders, including future Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev [00:03:30]. This enabled "renegade scientists" at the ITMVT to depose Nikolai Brevich and proceed with a more powerful digital computer [00:03:43].

This new machine was the "Bolshaya Electrono-Vychislitelnaya Mashina" or BESM-1, literally meaning "large calculating machine" [00:03:57]. It was capable of 8,000 to 10,000 operations per second (8-10 kiloflops), making it one of the world's fastest computers and certainly the fastest in Europe [00:04:03]. For comparison, the UNIVAC I, a leading American machine in 1951, managed only about one kiloflop [00:04:16].

### Early Setbacks and Bureaucratic Infighting

Despite BESM-1's potential, ITMVT struggled with its delivery [00:04:26]. The Ministry of Machine and Instrument Engineering had established SKB245, an institute initially for mechanical analog differential analyzers [00:04:30]. SKB245, however, went against its mandate to build its own digital computer, the Strela [00:04:49]. The Strela was computationally inferior to BESM-1, achieving only two kiloflops compared to BESM-1's 8-10 [00:04:57]. Strela's supporters argued that its performance, taking 10 hours for a calculation that would take a mathematician 100,000 days, was sufficient, a "bizarre argument" [00:05:04].

With Stalin's blessing, the two institutes competed, which harmed BESM-1's development [00:05:20]. ITMVT needed special cathode ray tubes for memory storage, but the sole ministry producing these, SKB245's ministry, refused to supply them for BESM-1 [00:05:26]. This forced the BESM-1 team to adopt inferior mercury storage tubes [00:05:46]. A 1951 state commission chose the Strela over BESM-1 [00:05:52]. However, users soon found the Strela broke down too often and could not solve the complex quadratic equations required for fission development, a critical need for the Soviet nuclear program [00:06:00]. By 1955, the head of the Soviet nuclear development effort requested BESM replacements [00:06:13]. BESM-1 remained Europe's fastest computer for a few more years, but this early episode foreshadowed future challenges in Soviet computer production [00:06:21].

## The Widening Gap: Production and Systemic Challenges

While the Soviets successfully developed first-generation computers as quickly as the West, arguably with superior technology, the real battle was lost at the production level [00:06:31].

> [!INFO] Production Disparity
> In 1959, the Soviet Union produced computers worth $59 million [00:06:53]. In the same year, the United States produced $1 billion of computer hardware [00:07:01]. By 1964, the Soviet Union produced 200 million semiconductor pieces, an improvement but still far behind the 1.36 billion produced by the United States [00:07:06]. This is where the battle was lost [00:07:19].

The [[challenges_in_soviet_computer_production | Soviet computing industry failed because it could not produce enough good computers fast enough]] [00:07:28]. In the [[rise_and_decline_of_soviet_economic_strategies | Soviet command economy]], computers failed to reach their full potential [00:07:34]. While the Soviet military had some demand, it was limited [00:07:38]. In the West, computer-aided automation revolutionized industrial processes like steelmaking and manufacturing, driving titanic commercial and industrial demand far exceeding military needs [00:07:43].

> [!WARNING] Lack of Incentives
> Soviet steelmakers only needed to meet quotas, with no stipulations on quality or efficiency [00:07:57]. Consequently, Soviet computer makers had little incentive to produce productivity-improving computers or provide necessary training and customer service [00:08:08]. Ministers, failing to see the computer's full potential, were reluctant to allocate limited resources to computer development, leading to factories lacking funding, materials, and talent [00:08:22]. For example, in 1958, the Penza computer plant, one of only two at the time, requested 50 computer experts but received only seven [00:08:37].

This was a [[soviet_industrial_growth_and_technological_lag | systemic problem]] for the Soviet Union, which historically lagged in distributing new revolutionary technologies across the country [00:08:49]. Despite pioneering in areas like steel-making (30 countries, including Japan, purchased their steel casting patent) and synthetic fibers, the Soviets consistently lagged their foreign peers in implementing these innovations within their own economy [00:08:58].

## Second and Third Generations: The Gap Widens

In 1959, the West transitioned from vacuum tubes to transistors, ushering in second-generation computing [00:09:16]. The transistor's reliability and smaller size transformed computers from scientific curiosities into powerful industrial tools, exemplified by the IBM 1401, which sold over 12,000 units and spurred development of new peripherals and programming paradigms [00:09:24].

The Soviets also developed their own second-generation computers, like the Ural series, and the BESM-6, their first supercomputer, capable of over a million operations per second [00:09:53]. BESM-6 entered production in 1967 and saw wide adoption, leading to new software and multi-program operating systems [00:10:07]. While this showed great progress, the Americans were already moving to the next big thing [00:10:28]. The Soviets delivered first and second-generation computers about two years behind the West â€“ "behind but not too far behind" [00:10:34].

This changed with third-generation computers powered by integrated circuits [00:10:43]. Mentions of a significant "computing gap" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union began to emerge here [00:10:48]. In 1964, IBM announced the System/360, a revolutionary line of computers with backwards and forwards compatibility, protecting customer software investments [00:10:54]. The 360 became one of IBM's greatest commercial successes [00:11:13].

In the Soviet Union, it became clear that future computer demand was limitless, and the fragmented domestic industry needed consolidation [00:11:18]. In 1964, *Izvestia*, the Soviet Union's newspaper of record, published the first major criticism of the country's computer efforts, calling for centralization [00:11:29]. Two years later, *Pravda* questioned the industry's readiness, stating, "unfortunately we must state that the situation is far from optimistic" [00:11:44].

### The ES Project: A Controversial Copying Strategy

Russia had a long [[soviet_industrial_growth_and_technological_lag | history of importing foreign technologies]], often to acquire expertise in disadvantaged industries like rocketry, which benefited from German scientists and war booty [00:11:59]. While technology transfer could be successful (e.g., China in solar, Japan/Taiwan/South Korea in semiconductors), there was a risk of "uncontrollable and irreversible addiction to the imported technology" if innovation wasn't self-generated [00:12:24].

In 1967, the Communist Party issued Resolution 1184-20 to consolidate the disparate computing industry, aiming for a series of unified third-generation computers called the "Edinaya Systema" (ES), meaning "Unified System" [00:12:52]. The resolution drastically increased the computing manufacturing budget tenfold to three billion rubles by 1975, calling for 28 new computer plants, expansion of 22 existing ones, and production of 20,000 computers by 1975 [00:13:14].

To build the ES, the two ministries in charge opted to copy the design of an American IBM 360 model to ensure compatibility with 360 software [00:13:31]. This decision was highly controversial [00:13:41]. Some argued it would make the USSR an "intellectual colony of the West" and hinder future indigenous innovation [00:13:44]. One memo warned, "Copying foreign work excludes the possibility of utilizing our own collective experience of computer research and in the immediate future will hinder our ability to employ new principles. This will bring the development of computer technology in our nation to an end" [00:13:59].

Furthermore, the U.S. government forbade IBM from exporting 360 systems to the Soviet Union, meaning the Soviets would lack proper documentation and have to acquire systems through espionage or intermediaries [00:14:21]. An alternative was available: ICL, the UK's largest computer maker, offered to share technology and documentation from their 360-compatible System 4 line in 1968, even committing funds and specialists [00:14:38]. This promised 360 software compatibility while retaining some industrial sovereignty [00:15:13].

However, working with ICL would delay the project by at least 1.5 years [00:15:23]. Such a delay was politically unpalatable given the already wide [[soviet_versus_western_computing_capabilities | Soviet-American computer gap]], especially in software [00:15:29]. With the domestic situation dire enough for Brezhnev to be aware, the Communist Party made this a high political priority, with severe penalties for missing deadlines [00:15:39]. Additionally, East Germany had already begun copying the IBM 360, making a shift to ICL politically difficult [00:15:52].

This decision to copy had "tragic long lasting consequences" [00:16:05]. Several prominent computer scientists resigned in protest, and Sergey Lebedev's attempts to reverse the decision failed, reportedly hastening his death in 1974 [00:16:13].

## Outcomes and Decline

The ES project involved over 100 organizations, 46,000 scientists, and 300,000 workers across Poland, East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Czechoslovakia, producing over 15,000 units [00:16:28]. Much of the hardware was reverse-engineered, but peripherals, particularly disk storage, remained inferior to Western alternatives [00:16:43]. While the ES's 360 compatibility did accelerate Soviet software capabilities, with CIA estimates in the 1970s suggesting the computing gap shrank from 10-15 years to 4-6 years, this was a short-term gain [00:16:58].

> [!NOTE] Long-Term Consequences
> Starting in the 1980s, the Soviet industry struggled to reverse-engineer increasingly complex Western computers, widening the gap once more [00:17:15]. The Soviets had lost the native industrial capacity to develop anything new on their own, making the gap permanent [00:17:28]. Industrial productivity suffered as 1970s computers aged and frequently broke down [00:17:35]. By 1989, a quarter of all Soviet general-purpose computers were ES-1022s, first released in 1974 but copying a 1965 technology, making them 24 years old [00:17:42].

The reliance on foreign technology also caused issues when the United States and the West levied export bans on advanced technologies during international crises [00:17:57]. While U.S. policymakers debated the merits of allowing Soviets access to American technology (hawks feared closing the gap), the gap persisted even with transfers [00:18:08]. The Soviets, with their human capital shortages, could never have created anything close to the IBM 360 software on their own [00:18:22].

The [[challenges_in_soviet_computer_production | fall of the Soviet computing industry]] is a story of wasted talents, lost progress, foolish short-term strategic choices made by politicians over scientists, and the inherent limits of centralized planning [00:18:36].

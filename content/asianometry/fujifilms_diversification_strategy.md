For decades, [[Kodak and Fujifilm rivalry | Eastman Kodak]] and [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] dominated the silver-based photographic film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, the market suddenly began to collapse with the advent of digital photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Despite the significant impact, [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] remarkably emerged from this digital transition as a larger, transformed company, unlike [[Kodaks failure to adapt | Kodak]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Early Company Culture and R&D Focus

[[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] was founded in 1934 as a subsidiary of the Digney Pond Celluloid company, Japan's first cinematic film manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The company emphasized developing its own technology internally, rather than importing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This focus on internal R&D became a core part of their culture and strategy, leading [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fuji]] to spend more on research and development than its peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

The production of color photographic film, which requires about 20 evenly coated layers of functional particles, demands near-semiconductor quality control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] completed its color film product in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Recognizing the Digital Shift

Both [[Kodaks failure to adapt | Kodak]] and [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] long recognized that the future lay in digital imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] gained early warnings about the impending digital transition from its diversified business lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

### Early Digital Health Innovations
In 1981, [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] released a new product for diagnostic x-ray imaging that replaced x-ray film with a photosensitive plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The resulting product, Fuji Computed Radiography, launched in 1983 and is still in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

### Strategic Response to Digitization
Shigataka Komori, a sales manager in the plate-making division, began to worry about a future where film was no longer needed at all due to digitization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Recognizing this challenge, [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] appointed Minoru Onishi as its new president in 1980, who introduced a three-pronged strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>:

1.  **Pioneer Digital Imaging**: Produce original digital imaging technologies, including developing their own imaging sensors and releasing their first digital camera, the Fujifilm DS-1P, in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
2.  **Sustain Analog Film**: "Milk the analog Cash Cow" by widening the quality gap with digital through improving film image quality, thereby prolonging the business's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
3.  **Build New Business Lines**: Develop new businesses outside of digital photography and analog photographic film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

By the mid-1980s, [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] was investing in various diversifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Some were peripheral to core photography, such as inkjet and optical disk technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Others were developed based on core photographic film manufacturing technologies, like cancer pharmaceuticals, done in collaboration with a Nobel Prize-winning scientist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Despite the success of its core film business in the 1980s, which saw sales grow and operating profits exceed $600 million USD in 1986, the company's success sometimes interfered with diversification efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## Vision 75: The Comprehensive Transformation

In 2004, with its core business collapsing due to the rapid decline in global demand for color film after 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] CEO Shigataka Komori announced "Vision 75" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This plan aimed to guide the company beyond its photographic roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

### Step 1: Strategic Reforms
[[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] implemented significant reforms, including cutting jobs, closing factories, and canceling sales partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. From 2006, they spent $1.8 billion on these restructuring efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Despite the drastic changes, Komori remained committed to preserving the culture of photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

### Step 2: Finding New Profitable Growth
Selling digital cameras was not a sustainable replacement for the film business, which once provided 60% of [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fuji's]] sales and two-thirds of its profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. This led [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] to transition into entirely new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

Many of these new markets grew out of the technologies developed for their film business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

*   **Fujitec (TAC Celluloids)**: From the 1950s, [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] produced triacetyl cellulose (TAC) celluloids for film bases, which are highly transparent with smooth surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. This material found unexpected success in the LCD industry as a protective covering for polarizing layers, becoming a billion-dollar business by the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

### Step 3: Six Priority Businesses
After reviewing all their laboratory technologies, [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] identified six priority businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>:

1.  **Digital Imaging**: Focusing on high-end digital cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
2.  **Optical Devices**: Known as Fujinon, producing lenses for broadcast television and security cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
3.  **Specialty Chemicals/Materials**: Leveraging expertise from Fujitec, serving industries like solar panels, touch panels, and semiconductors (including photoresists) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
4.  **Graphics**: Products for digital printing and in-house inkjet technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
5.  **Documents**: Printers and office copier solutions, largely dominated by the Fuji Xerox joint venture, which became [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] Business Innovation and the company's largest business line by 2021, accounting for 30% of total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
6.  **Healthcare**: This area represents a significant diversification, building on existing x-ray film products, endoscopes, ultrasonic devices, and healthcare imaging systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

    *   **Pharmaceuticals and Cosmetics**: Starting in 1996, [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] began filing many patent applications for pharmaceutical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. They started producing skincare cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
    *   **Leveraging Core Expertise**: There is significant crossover with photography film production expertise, including emulsions (suspending one substance in another), oxidation (aging photos and chemicals), and collagen (a major ingredient in gelatin used for film) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.
    *   **Strategic Acquisitions**: [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] augmented its R&D with selective acquisitions, including several medical imaging companies in 2006 and Toyama Chemical for nearly $1.5 billion in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

## Outcome and Comparison

By its 2008 fiscal year, [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] reported its highest sales in history, reaching 2.8 trillion yen (approximately $27 billion USD), a 100% increase from 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. Imaging products, which once constituted 54% of revenues, shrank to just 19% by 2008, demonstrating the successful diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

While sales have largely plateaued since 2015, this outcome is a far better fate than what befell [[Kodaks failure to adapt | Kodak]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. From 2005 to 2010, [[Kodaks failure to adapt | Kodak's]] sales declined from $11 billion to $5.9 billion, whereas [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm's]] sales grew nearly 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

The fundamental difference between the two companies was their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. [[Kodaks failure to adapt | Kodak]] was primarily a consumer brand with a strong technology base, while [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] began as a technology company that happened to sell to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. When its consumer businesses disappeared, [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | Fujifilm]] found it easier to revert to its roots and diversify, relying on its expertise in chemistry and precision chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. [[Kodaks failure to adapt | Kodak]], conversely, could not make this shift and ultimately filed for bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

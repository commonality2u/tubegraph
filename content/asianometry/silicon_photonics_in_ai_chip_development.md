One suggestion for the future of [[The AI and AI chip boom landscape | AI chips]] is to implement them using [[Future prospects and innovations in the field of silicon photonics | silicon photonics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

## Current Challenges with Traditional Architectures
Traditional servers in data centers operate with a CPU processing information and a separate memory bank for data and instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. This setup, known as a von Neumann architecture, has been in use since the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

However, neural networks pose a challenge to this architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Beyond their highly parallel nature, the separation between the processor and memory significantly slows things down, akin to the brain storing its synapses and neurons in two distinct locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

## The Promise of Silicon Photonics
[[Advantages of Silicon Photonics over traditional electrical systems | Silicon photonics]] products utilize light instead of electricity to transmit signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Light can travel through optical fiber at the fastest possible speed without generating additional heat concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Implementing new [[The AI and AI chip boom landscape | AI chips]] with [[Future prospects and innovations in the field of silicon photonics | silicon photonics]] is seen as a potential next step for specialized architectures, as current [[The AI and AI chip boom landscape | AI accelerators]] can still take hours or longer to train a single machine learning model for production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

While there's a question of whether future [[The AI and AI chip boom landscape | AI accelerators]] must follow the path of bitcoin miners by continuously moving to more advanced nodes – which would favor large chip companies like [[Nvidia and competition in the AI chip market | Nvidia]] with their greater access and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a> – a more interesting approach might involve companies finding new ways to achieve similar inference or training results without relying on advanced nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This could involve [[Future prospects and innovations in the field of silicon photonics | silicon photonics]] or other methods like advanced parallelism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

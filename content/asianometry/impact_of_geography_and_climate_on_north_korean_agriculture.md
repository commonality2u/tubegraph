The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), also known as North Korea, has long pursued [[north_koreas_quest_for_food_selfsufficiency | food self-sufficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Achieving this goal is challenging due to the country's unique geographical and climatic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Geographical Landscape
Historically, before the division of the peninsula, Korea's north was its industrial heartland, while the south served as its breadbasket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This historical specialization reflects the inherent geography:
*   **Mountainous Terrain** 80% of North Korea's land is composed of mountains and uplands, interspersed with deep valleys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Population Distribution** The majority of the country's 25 million people reside on the coastal plains and lowlands of the west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Arable Land** Only about 15% of North Korea's land is considered arable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. While this is higher than the global average of 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> (and comparable to Taiwan's 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>), much of the country's limited arable land is found on the west coast, where conditions for farming are more favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Climate and Weather Patterns
North Korea experiences a climate that presents significant challenges for agriculture:
*   **Short Cropping Season** The general cropping season is relatively short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Extreme Winters** Winters can be quite harsh, particularly in the mountainous regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Hot, Humid, and Rainy Summers** Summers are short, hot, humid, and rainy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Concentrated Rainfall** A significant portion, 60%, of the DPRK's annual rainfall occurs between June and September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The remaining 40% is widely distributed and sporadic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This uneven distribution leaves the country highly vulnerable to both droughts and floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Consequences of Geographical and Climatic Challenges
The combination of mountainous terrain, limited arable land, and unpredictable weather patterns has a profound [[challenges_and_reforms_in_north_koreas_agricultural_sector | impact on North Korea's agricultural sector]]:

### Vulnerability to Extreme Weather Events
The country's susceptibility to droughts and floods is exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure and deforestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Marginal Land and Deforestation
During the 1990s famine, the government allowed cultivation on lands with slopes above 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. These soils are of poor quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Satellite imagery indicates that one million hectares of land on slopes above 10 degrees have been cleared for growing cereals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Increased Flood Risk** With much of the country being mountainous and prone to unpredictable rainfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, the removal of trees leads to soil erosion. Without trees to hold down the soil, heavy rainstorms can easily wash it away, creating rivers of silt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. This damages the soil's growing capacity and makes floods more dangerous to people and property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Floods have been notably more destructive since the 1980s, coinciding with the increase in deforestation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   **Energy Shortages** Deforestation also impacts the rural population's ability to generate energy, as 77% of the rural population and 28% of the urban population rely on wood for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

### Soil Quality Deterioration
North Korea's agricultural practices often conflict with modern conservation methods:
*   **Aggressive Plowing and Tilling** Farmers aggressively plow and till their soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Chemical Fertilizers** Heavy use of chemical fertilizers has led to soil acidification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This hampers the soil's ability to absorb air and water and the plants' ability to take up nutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. The soil's reddish hue indicates a lack of organic matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Double Cropping** Aggressive double cropping, planting multiple crops in the same area or year, has deteriorated the land's capacity to cultivate food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. For example, potatoes are double-cropped in spring and winter, and barley is grown as a primary spring crop and in smaller quantities during winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **Declining Yields** In 2011, the average yield of paddy rice was 3.9 tons per hectare, a significant drop from 8.0 tons per hectare in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Reluctance to Adopt Sustainable Practices
Farmers are reluctant to adopt beneficial practices like rotating in legumes, which improve soil fertility by increasing nitrogen and water retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. This reluctance stems from the fear of not meeting wheat production goals set by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

Despite [[economic_policies_and_their_influence_on_north_korean_agriculture | economic policy changes]] and improvements in food distribution since the famine of the 1990s, the fundamental agricultural situation, heavily influenced by geographical constraints and climate, continues to present significant challenges to North Korea's quest for food security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

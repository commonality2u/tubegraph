Once a significant pillar of the Australian economy, the domestic automobile industry, which once employed 100,000 people and produced tens of thousands of vehicles for both local consumption and export, has all but vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The last factory, operated by Toyota, closed in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This decline was heavily influenced by evolving government policies and global economic shifts.

## The Formative Years: Government Nurturing and Protection

Emerging from World War II, the Australian government actively sought to rebuild its economy and foster manufacturing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Car manufacturing was a high priority, with the government offering foreign companies subsidies and tax concessions to establish production in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This attracted manufacturers like Volkswagen, British Motors Leyland, and Ford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

A notable success was GM Holden, the Australian subsidiary of the American automaker, which produced the first "all-Australian car" in Melbourne in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This rugged vehicle was uniquely suited for Australia's rural areas and dominated the market throughout the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

This domestic manufacturing industry thrived within a protected market, where high tariffs ensured demand for local employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. These employers could then pass on the costs of paying a "fair and reasonable basic wage," supported by powerful trade unions and a compulsory arbitration system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Despite being owned by foreign multinationals, Australia's car making industry benefited from its integration into a larger globalized network, allowing Australian-made auto components to be produced at scale and exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. However, a significant drawback was that Australia did not own and control its automaking destiny, as profits and core decisions flowed to foreign headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Decline and Policy Shifts in the 1970s

By the early 1970s, the automotive manufacturing industry employed over 100,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. However, the decade saw a substantial loss of competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Automakers produced too many models (five companies, 15 models), leading to a lack of economies of scale with individual production runs as small as 25,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The focus on rugged rural cars also disconnected them from the majority of the population living in cities, creating market gaps, particularly in the small car segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

This gap allowed high-quality, low-cost Japanese imports to gain a significant foothold, with sales growing rapidly despite tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. For instance, the Datsun, made by [[challenges_facing_nissan_in_the_automotive_industry | Nissan]], saw sales grow to nearly 20,000 units by 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Whitlam Government Reforms (1972-1975)

The 1972 election of the Whitlam government brought significant reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This administration, the first Australian Labor Party government in 32 years, was not favorable to foreign multinational car makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. In early 1973, with strong demand and concerns about rising inflation, the government sought to reduce tariffs and trade barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Believing the Australian economy could withstand a rapid drop in trade protections, and aiming to expand international trade opportunities, particularly with Japan, officials moved towards a more liberal trade policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

The most controversial step was an abrupt 25% reduction in all tariffs on imported goods in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This confrontational tactic led to immediate repercussions, with GM Holden firing 5,000 workers and sparking a political crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

The OPEC oil embargo and the collapse of the Bretton Woods international monetary regime in 1973 further exacerbated the situation, leading to soaring oil prices, inflation, and unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This spurred sales of gas-sipping small and medium four-cylinder cars, a market dominated by Japanese imports, while the market share of Australian-made large six-cylinder cars collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

To avoid tariffs, major Japanese automakers like Toyota and [[challenges_facing_nissan_in_the_automotive_industry | Nissan]] established domestic Australian assembly operations, further bloating the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. [[challenges_facing_nissan_in_the_automotive_industry | Nissan]] Motors eventually purchased its assembling facility in Clayton, Victoria, making it a regional headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

As the six-cylinder market declined, thousands of jobs were lost throughout the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. British Motors Leyland closed its Australian operations in 1975, cutting 2,600 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. The worsening economic situation forced the government to reimpose import quotas in 1974-1975, which stemmed the bleeding but did not reverse the trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

A critical missing element was a government entity similar to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which could coordinate the industry's transition and manage mergers to create competitive entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Without such guidance, Australia's four remaining domestic OEMs struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. The collapse of Australian automobile exports, dwindling from 60,000 units in 1970 to a few hundred by 1979, clearly indicated the domestic industry's uncompetitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Liberalization and Further Decline (1980s-2000s)

The mid-1980s saw new government leadership and major macroeconomic policy changes, including banking sector deregulation, financial market liberalization, and floating the Australian dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The intention was to reorient domestic manufacturing industries towards exports, challenging the long-held belief in tariff protection which had fostered "inefficient industries that could not compete overseas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

The "New Car Plan," introduced in late 1983 by Senator John Button, offered car manufacturers credits and subsidies for Australian-made cars, along with temporary government support like targeted procurement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. However, it also rapidly reduced import tariffs from 57.5% to 45% by 1988, with further reductions planned until 2000, and removed import quotas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. The goal was to slim the domestic industry into a "leaner, meaner entity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

The "shrinking part went as expected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Ford lost $60 million in 1992 and laid off thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Plant closures by all domestic automakers characterized the 1980s and 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Unexpectedly, Australian-made cars became *less* competitive, as domestic car makers responded with cost-cutting, reducing investment in R&D and manufacturing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Foreign companies, which had largely entered Australia to bypass trade protections, saw little reason to maintain expensive manufacturing operations once those protections vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, domestic assembly stabilized around 350,000 units per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. However, with economic and population growth, the domestic makers' share of the overall market continued to shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This occurred despite $500 million AUD of annual government support through schemes like the Automotive Competitive and Investment Scheme (ACIS), which cost the Australian government $7 billion AUD from 2001 to 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

The mining boom starting in 2000, fueled by demand from China and India, caused a dramatic appreciation of the Australian dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. While appearing positive, a stronger currency significantly increased the cost of Australian automotive production, leading to chronic losses for the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. From 2003 to 2010, the industry lost 25,000 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

### Mitsubishi Closure and GFC Interventions

In April 2004, Mitsubishi announced the closure of its engine and assembly plants in Southern Adelaide, leading to 1,167 job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. The federal government provided $40 million AUD for the region and $10 million AUD to help retrenched Mitsubishi workers, with the state government adding another $5 million AUD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. However, this assistance was largely ineffective, and the Mitsubishi plant closed for good in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

The Global Financial Crisis (2007-2009) prompted further government interventions, including the Green Car Innovation Fund and the Automotive Transformation Scheme, which subsidized automotive investment and research, particularly in energy efficiency and green technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. The government also provided a $200 million AUD line of credit to GM Holden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

## The Final Chapter (2013 Onwards)

By 2013, a new conservative-leaning government under Prime Minister Tony Abbott came to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. This government disagreed with the previous administration's interventions, asserting that "the government's role is not to prop up private business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. They questioned why the automotive industry should receive preferential treatment and subsidies when other Australian manufacturing sectors were also struggling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

The Australian automobile manufacturing industry was a shadow of its former self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. Production numbers were far below the 250,000 cars per factory per year needed for modern economies of scale (e.g., GM Holden at 160,000, Mitsubishi at 35,000, Ford at 70,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. Australian labor costs were also significantly higher than emerging low-cost manufacturers in China and Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. While Australian labor unions eventually collaborated closely with companies like GM Holden after the financial crisis, it was not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

Ultimately, the lack of consistent government support was deemed critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. The industry had absorbed billions in subsidies with little to show, and the new government's dismissive stance and policy uncertainty contributed to instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Faced with neither stability nor lasting commitments, Toyota and GM pulled out, marking the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

## Consequences and Lessons Learned

The demise of Australia's domestic auto industry had wide-ranging consequences:
*   **Domestic Components Industry**: The loss of the assembly industry as an anchor led to the closure of many of the 260 Australian businesses that supplied the automotive sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.
*   **Research and Development (R&D)**: R&D spending by Australian automotive companies, which amounted to $700 million AUD in its final years (2% of national R&D spending), vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
*   **Workforce Impact**: Approximately 14,000 people lost their jobs after the Toyota and GM Holden factories closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. Government and community support helped cushion the financial blow for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.
*   **Cultural Loss**: The industry's demise closed a uniquely Australian chapter of history, as the cars had helped mythologize the idea of the pioneering spirit and the "backyard inventor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

While there are "no heroes or villains" in this story, Australia faced inherent challenges such as its remote location and higher costs of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Despite billions poured into the industry by the government, the economics and economies of scale were ultimately not there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

One criticism is that the government could have been more involved at critical times, similar to how Japan's MITI orchestrated mergers in its automobile industry in the 1960s to create national champions like Toyota and [[challenges_facing_nissan_in_the_automotive_industry | Nissan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. It is pondered whether forced mergers or a controlling government share could have kept the industry alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

Despite the closures, there are [[future_prospects_for_australian_automotive_technology | future prospects for Australian automotive technology]]. Toyota and other automakers continue to leverage Australia's educated labor for developing new automotive technologies, with the former Toyota Altona factory being converted into a transport hub for green hydrogen technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>.

By 1979, the Soviet Union had become the world's leading oil producer, pumping 11.5 million barrels daily. This marked a significant rise from its position at the end of the 1960s as the second-biggest oil-producing nation. Much of this growth was driven by the discovery and development of vast oil and natural gas deposits hidden beneath Siberia's frozen swamps and lakes, which would transform the country into an energy superpower [00:00:03].

## The Untapped Riches of West Siberia

East of the Ural Mountains, the Soviet West Siberian Basin spans 3.4 million square kilometers, nearly five times the size of Texas [00:00:52]. Approximately one-third of this area, almost one million square kilometers, is potentially oil-bearing, exceeding the combined size of Texas and Oklahoma [00:01:06].

Despite its vast potential, the region is undeveloped, harsh, and remote. Summers are short, and winters are long and severe, with temperatures dropping to as low as -27 degrees Celsius, making frost and fog common [00:01:19]. Sixty to seventy percent of the area consists of swamps and lakes, which freeze solid for nine or ten months of the year, further complicating development [00:01:33]. Consequently, the area was sparsely populated, with most peasants settling in the Siberian south due to the cold [00:01:44].

However, beneath these challenging lands lay some of the world's largest oil and gas deposits, second only to those in the Persian Gulf. These include the massive Urengoy gas field and Russia's biggest oil field, Samotlor [00:02:00].

### Initial Hesitation and Declining Fields

While [[soviet_oil_production_in_the_1960s | Soviet oil production]] rose from under 3 million barrels per day to 7.1 million barrels from 1960 to 1970, much of this came from the "Second Baku" area of the [[soviet_oil_production_in_the_1960s | Volga-Ural]] province in the European regions of the Soviet Union [00:02:27]. Soviet geologists had predicted the West Siberian Basin's significant deposits as early as the 1930s [00:02:52]. However, the government initially refrained from extensive exploration and development, with some officials dismissing the claims as "the fruit of a sick provincial imagination" [00:03:08].

Circumstances forced a change of mind:
*   **Declining [[soviet_oil_production_in_the_1960s | Volga-Ural]] Production**: Starting in the mid-to-late 1960s, the [[soviet_oil_production_in_the_1960s | Volga-Ural]] oil field began to decline much faster than anticipated. From 1971 to 1975, the decline was 261 million tons, far exceeding the planned 150 million tons [00:03:35].
*   **Crucial Economic Functions**: Oil production was vital for the Soviet economy:
    *   It was the country's largest source of foreign currency, accounting for over 50% of earnings used to purchase essential goods like wheat from abroad [00:04:06].
    *   The Soviets had long-term oil export obligations to Eastern Bloc countries, particularly those in the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), who depended on Soviet energy (except Romania) [00:04:17]. These "brotherly terms" deliveries were made through extensive pipelines like Druzhba ("Friendship") and Bratstvo ("Brotherhood") [00:04:29].

## The Push for Siberian Development

In January 1968, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin visited the Tyumen region of West Siberia, emphasizing its potential for advancing the [[soviet_economy_in_the_1960s | Soviet economy]] and the need for infrastructure [00:04:39]. By 1971, Brezhnev himself began urgently pushing for West Siberian development [00:04:57]. A new ministry, led by Boris Shcherbina (later known for managing the Chernobyl crisis), was founded to build oil infrastructure in the region [00:05:04].

Developing West Siberia presented serious challenges due to its lack of existing population and infrastructure. Unlike Baku or the [[postwar_soviet_union_oil_industry_developments | Volga-Ural]] regions, West Siberia required the Soviets to create entire towns from scratch to support hundreds of thousands of geologists, builders, and work crews [00:05:36]. Worker settlements were difficult to build in the harsh conditions, and with agriculture nearly impossible, all food had to be transported by rail [00:06:07]. This resulted in a cost of living 1.5 to 1.7 times higher than in European parts of the country [00:06:17].

To attract workers in an era when Soviet citizens had more freedom of choice in employment, salaries in West Siberia were 2.2 to 2.5 times higher than elsewhere, and promotion was easier [00:06:30]. The party launched media campaigns to recruit specialists from older oil and gas regions, attracting mostly young workers (under 35) seeking to earn significant money over a short period [00:06:48].

### Production Boom and Infrastructure

West Siberia soon began yielding its vast riches:
*   **1965**: 5.6 million tons of oil, 1.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas [00:07:06].
*   **1970**: Oil production reached 31 million tons [00:07:16].
*   **1975**: Oil production reached 141 million tons [00:07:22].
*   **1977**: Production soared to 211 million tons [00:07:29].
*   By 1973, 113 oil fields had been discovered, including supergiant fields with 5 billion tons of reserves, such as Samotlor [00:07:33].

The Soviets rapidly built long gas pipelines to transport products to European buyers. In the latter half of the 1970s, 1,400 kilometers of pipeline were laid, involving moving 130 million cubic meters of soil and disrupting 27.2 million square meters of agricultural land [00:07:48]. Pipeline construction rates were three to five times faster than in the West, resulting in costs per kilometer a third of Western averages [00:08:16].

However, this rapid development came at a severe environmental cost. The Soviets disregarded ecological concerns, leading to wastewater pollution, torn swathes of taiga, and hundreds of abandoned drilled wells [00:08:28]. The priority was fulfilling the economic plan "no matter what" [00:08:46].

## International and Bloc-Wide Impact

West Siberia's oil dominance found timely customers. Following international conflicts in the 1950s and 60s, Europe sought to diversify its oil sources beyond Arab oil, making [[influence_of_soviet_oil_exports_on_international_relations | Soviet oil]] a compelling option [00:09:00]. Austria signed a deal in 1968, followed by Italy (1969), West Germany (1970), and France (1972) [00:09:16].

West Germany's decision to accept [[influence_of_soviet_oil_exports_on_international_relations | Soviet gas]] was particularly notable and domestically controversial, balancing rising domestic gas demand against political issues like Berlin's division and German reunification [00:09:31]. The German Ministry of Economics believed that keeping the Soviet share under 20% would be acceptable [00:10:04]. The year after West Germany began accepting Soviet gas, the two sides signed the [[influence_of_soviet_oil_exports_on_international_relations | Four Power Agreement of 1971]], leading to *de facto* recognition between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic [00:10:12]. These agreements, part of DÃ©tente, led to other economic partnerships, including a potential "North Star" energy deal with the United States in 1972, which ultimately failed due to congressional opposition [00:10:29]. The oil crises of the 1970s, including the Iranian Revolution, further accelerated these economic exchanges with Western Europe [00:11:24].

Within the Eastern Bloc, [[influence_of_soviet_oil_exports_on_international_relations | Soviet oil]] and energy exports were crucial for maintaining coherence [00:11:40]. The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) facilitated trade where the Soviets provided raw goods (including oil) to satellites at "brotherly terms" prices, far below Western market rates [00:11:48]. While these terms were known to be unfavorable to the Soviets since the mid-1960s, the opportunity costs became increasingly clear as the profitable West European export industry grew [00:12:31]. Failing to meet these oil obligations would have severe political and socioeconomic repercussions for dependent states like East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, especially as they became indebted to Western creditors [00:12:51].

## Stagnation and Decline

The expectation that West Siberia's energy output would grow infinitely proved false; production stalled and declined as quickly as it grew [00:13:14]. Starting in 1975, West Siberia's oil production growth rates rapidly declined, from 23.8% in 1976 to 7% in 1981 [00:13:24]. This had massive ripple effects:
*   The overall [[soviet_oil_production_in_the_1960s | Soviet oil production]] growth rate, which was 9.1% annually in the 1960s, fell to 6.2% between 1971 and 1978 [00:13:40].
*   By 1981, the country's total oil growth rate plummeted to under one percent [00:13:57].

Without access to more advanced Western drilling technology, Brezhnev's government resorted to drilling more exploratory wells, doubling the annual drilling from 13 million meters in 1977 to over 26 million in 1984, with 16 million of that new drilling in West Siberia alone [00:14:04]. This meant drilling further, deeper, and in more complicated formations, doubling drilling costs per meter [00:14:32]. Despite these "all-out efforts," Soviet oil output fell into negative growth by 1984 [00:14:45].

This meant the Soviet energy industry, and eventually the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet economy]] as a whole, found itself investing more to produce less, caught in a cycle of "throwing good money after bad" [00:14:55]. The Soviet empire also became more energy-intensive; by 1987, it required the energy equivalent of 0.83 tons of coal to generate a thousand dollars of economic income, up from 0.71 tons in 1970 [00:15:09].

Cutting consumption was difficult due to the [[influence_of_military_and_heavy_industry_on_soviet_economic_policy | Soviet economy's]] structure: only 15% of oil consumption came from households, while nearly half was from heavy industry, which was less flexible in adjusting usage [00:15:32]. Combined with significant oil export obligations, the Soviets had little room to reduce consumption, necessitating continued production from the wells [00:16:04].

### The Final Blow

By the late 1980s, despite being the world's largest oil producer and third-biggest coal producer, the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet economy]] had stagnated, consumed by its unproductive energy industry [00:16:16]. Coherence within the Eastern Bloc faded as the Soviets prioritized their own needs, leading satellite states to turn to the West [00:16:30].

The final blow came in 1986 when oil prices collapsed. Rising output from Alaska, the British North Sea, and OPEC (particularly Saudi Arabia drastically raising quotas in September 1985) led to an oil glut. Prices fell from $27 a barrel to below $10 [00:16:40]. This collapse meant all the Soviet investment in oil suddenly turned a loss, and foreign currency earnings from oil and gas sales evaporated, paving the way for the debt crisis that contributed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union a few years later [00:17:02].

Some argue that the Soviets might have been better off in the long run had they never exploited West Siberian oil and gas [00:17:16]. High energy revenues "papered over" the need for crucial reforms in the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet economy]]. There was "no need to improve domestic agriculture if oil money paid for meat and butter from the West," and "no need to make your own computer if you can just buy them from the West" [00:17:22].

Ultimately, energy both sustained and undermined the Soviet Union. It was a pillar that kept the "Soviet house standing for far longer than it should have" but also a "crutch that weakened the country's ability to stand up on its own" [00:17:38]. The legacy of the Soviet energy superpower and its influence on European and Asian politics continues to this day [00:17:52].

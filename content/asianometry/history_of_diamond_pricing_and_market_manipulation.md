Diamond prices have famously had little to no relation to their extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While a diamond at a jewelry shop might cost around $550 per carat, or up to $20,000 per carat for high-class diamonds, their mining cost is remarkably stable at about $58 to $60 per carat, similar to an industrial stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This high price is maintained by various supply cartels throughout history, which carefully manage supply, releasing only a few diamonds each year to keep prices steady <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Historical Market Control
The overpricing of diamonds is not a recent phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. For centuries, market entities have attempted to control diamond supply to inflate prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Even in antiquity, when Indian kings dominated production, prices far exceeded extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. For example, in the 1500s, a half-carat diamond could cost the equivalent of 30,000 days of an average laborer's wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

A flood of new diamonds hit the market in 1725 when the Portuguese discovered deposits in Brazil, causing prices to spiral down by 30-50 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The Portuguese Crown quickly took control of the mines and limited supply to restore price levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] and the Diamond Cartel
The most famous supply cartel was [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The discovery of the 21.8-carat Eureka diamond in South Africa in 1866 by an eight-year-old boy triggered a mining rush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Production in South Africa's four open-cast diamond mines, including Kimberly and [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]], surged from 100,000 carats in 1870 to 3 million carats in 1880 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

Amidst this boom, Cecil Rhodes established his [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] Mining Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Rhodes managed the company efficiently, reducing labor costs by housing migrant workers in closed compounds and strictly controlling theft, which lowered labor costs from 36% in 1883 to just over 26% in 1887 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This financial strength allowed [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] to buy out competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. By 1888, Rhodes and [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] Consolidated controlled the South African diamond mining industry and imposed production limits to stabilize prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

After Rhodes's death, Ernst Oppenheimer, founder of Anglo-American, took over as chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Under his leadership, [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] created agreements with other diamond producers to sell all raw production to the Central Selling Organization (CSO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The CSO bought diamonds at a fixed profit-guaranteeing price and resold them during 10 "sites" (sales events) to jewelry cutting factories known as "site holders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Site holders were not allowed to negotiate, had to take the entire box of diamonds at the set price, and could not resell rough diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Those who didn't follow the rules were expelled from the cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

The CSO also managed the industry's marketing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In 1938, Harry Oppenheimer, Ernst's son, collaborated with N.W. Ayer of New York to launch a marketing campaign linking diamonds and romance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This campaign used influencer marketing (movie stars wearing diamonds), content marketing (news articles about celebrities acquiring diamonds likened to fine art), and smart advertising, famously coining the 1949 slogan "A diamond is forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This campaign made diamonds the pinnacle of luxury and a fixture at weddings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## [[Development of synthetic diamonds | Development of Synthetic Diamonds]]
For centuries, people attempted to create their own diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. In 1797, Smithson Tennant demonstrated that diamonds were a form of carbon by burning them in oxygen to produce carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Recognizing diamonds as a denser form of carbon, early attempts focused on subjecting carbon to high pressure and heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Famous scientists like James Hannay and Nobel laureate Ferdinand Frederick Henri Moissan claimed success in the late 1800s, but their results could not be replicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The technology of their era was simply incapable of the conditions required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

A more scientific approach emerged in 1915 when Gilbert Lewis and Merle Randall showed that diamond and graphite were in equilibrium at 10,000 atmospheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This led to mapping the conditions under which carbon forms diamond, indicating that it requires 2000 degrees Celsius and over a million pounds per square inch of pressure, possibly less with a metal catalyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### High-Pressure, High-Temperature (HPHT) Method
In February 1953, researchers at the General Swedish Electrical Limited Company (ASEA) produced the first [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds | synthetic diamond]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. They used a device with a sealed hollow cube surrounded by six anvils, applying hydraulic force to generate pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Heat was applied by igniting thermite with an electric filament, heating graphite to 2000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Initial failures led them to add iron as a solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This resulted in small diamond crystals (about 0.1 millimeters across) under conditions of 80,000 bar (1.2 million pounds per square inch) and 2000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. ASEA did not immediately publicize or patent their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

In 1951, General Electric (GE), then the world's largest diamond consumer, formed a group to study [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds | synthetic diamond]] production due to supply chain concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Collaborating with physicist P.W. Bridgman, they developed a "belt apparatus" capable of exerting 3 million pounds per square inch at 3400 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. At these extreme conditions, carbon could directly transform into diamond without a solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, yielding small crystals about one millimeter wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

The news of GE's success initially threatened consumer belief in the uniqueness of natural diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:01]</a>. However, the small size of these [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds | synthetic diamonds]] posed no threat to [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]], which dealt in larger stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Researchers later found that by using a seed diamond and controlling heat and pressure, they could grow diamonds up to three carats, but these were dark, low-quality, and had an "onion-like" structure, making them suitable only for industrial grit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

Despite these advancements, [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] retained market power through the 1950s and 60s, navigating revolutionary politics in Africa and new discoveries in Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] even formed a semi-secret agreement with the Soviet Union, allowing it to market and sell 80% of global output despite mining only 25-40% of the supply itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

It was not until 1970 that scientists could create a large, gem-quality crystal using the HPHT method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The secret was a long cook time; a one-carat diamond takes about a week to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Faster growth led to flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This long cook time made it economically unfeasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Furthermore, these crystals were typically yellow and easily distinguishable from natural diamonds using techniques like ultraviolet fluorescence or absorption spectroscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### [[CVD method for producing synthetic diamonds | CVD Method]]
Researchers began exploring whether diamonds could be grown in a low-pressure environment without expensive equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. From 1952 to 1953, William Eversole of Union Carbide conducted experiments where he heated carbon-containing gas in the presence of a seed diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Carbon atoms from the gas attached to the diamond surface, increasing its mass without high pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. This method, known as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), is heavily used in the [[history_of_silicon_wafer_development | semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

Eversole's work was initially overshadowed by the HPHT method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, but in 1963, Dr. John Angus of Case Western Reserve University began replicating and continuing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. The key to successfully growing pure gem-quality diamonds with [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | CVD]] was atomic hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Initially, Angus's team used alternating growth and cleaning cycles (using sulfuric acid to etch off unwanted graphite) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. A PhD student suggested using an atomic hydrogen stream from a tungsten filament for cleaning, which allowed both growth and cleaning in the same chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

In 1971, Angus's mention of atomic hydrogen at a Soviet academic meeting intrigued Soviet researchers, who pioneered using atomic hydrogen during the growth phase as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. This suppressed graphite formation and turned any formed graphite into gas, carrying it away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. In the 1980s, a team at Japan's National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials used hot filaments or microwaves to activate hydrogen and methane mixtures, accelerating growth to a few micrometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## [[Impact of synthetic diamonds on the jewelry market | Impact of Synthetic Diamonds]]
By the 1990s, the [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | CVD]] industry overcame its limitations, producing single-crystal [[impact_of_synthetic_diamonds_on_the_jewelry_market | synthetic diamonds]] in various colors, which began appearing in the jewelry market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

[[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] responded by investing in new detection methods, including UV fluorescence, X-rays, and advanced spectroscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. While this worked for a time, [[impact_of_synthetic_diamonds_on_the_jewelry_market | synthetics]] rapidly eliminated this weakness, reaching a point where they can only be identified in a lab with very advanced tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

This technical improvement coincided with massive changes in the diamond industry during the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. While Japan's rise as a luxury jewelry market in the late 1980s boosted the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, the fall of the Soviet Union and new deposits in Australia introduced new competitors, fragmenting the old cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. Lev Leviev, a former [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] customer, purchased diamond factories and partnered with Russia's new monopoly, Al Rosa, creating one of the first truly independent competitors to [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Australian mining giant BHP, with its Argyle diamond mine, also stayed out of the cartel, taking market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

By the turn of the century, [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] acknowledged it no longer spoke for the entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. In 2000, [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] restructured into a more traditional luxury company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>, shifting marketing to promote [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] affiliated dealers and partnering with Louis Vuitton for branded retail ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

In 2020, [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] announced it would start producing and selling its own [[impact_of_synthetic_diamonds_on_the_jewelry_market | synthetics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This move reflects an attempt to leverage the technological advances in the [[impact_of_synthetic_diamonds_on_the_jewelry_market | synthetic diamond]] industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

This market transition echoes that of pearls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Natural pearls were once wild-harvested gems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, but in the 1910s, Japan pioneered cultured pearl farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Consumers preferred these synthetic pearls for their rounder, better look, environmental friendliness, and lower exploitation of workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Today, virtually every pearl in a jewelry shop is cultured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

Modern gem-quality [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | CVD]] [[impact_of_synthetic_diamonds_on_the_jewelry_market | synthetic diamonds]] are becoming a superior product: more beautiful and ideal-looking, better for the environment, produced with less worker exploitation, and far cheaper than natural diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. [[impact_of_synthetic_diamonds_on_the_jewelry_market | Synthetic diamonds]] are transforming the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Where value was once placed on the scarcity of the stone, it may now shift to the scarcity of luxury brands like [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]], similar to a Louis Vuitton item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

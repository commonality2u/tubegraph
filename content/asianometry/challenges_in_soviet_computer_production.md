By 1986, the Soviet Union possessed just over 10,000 computers, in stark contrast to the United States' 1.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While the Soviet Union was the world's third most proficient computing power at the time of Stalin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, a significant gap emerged by the 1960s, becoming undeniable and effectively permanent by the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Despite the Soviet state's belief in science and industrial modernization, with plentiful support for research and development and fine minds (evidenced by Sputnik and Venus landings), severe challenges plagued its computer production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Early Development Struggles and Political Obstacles

News of the ENIAC, the first general-purpose programmable computer built in the United States, reached the Soviet Union in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Despite limited knowledge of its workings, the Soviets recognized the West's resource investment in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The government urgently needed to improve calculating workflows; for instance, the nuclear weapons effort required over 100 "calculator girls" working daily eight-hour shifts on calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

In 1948, the Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Technology (ITMVT) was established within the Soviet Academy of Sciences to explore computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. However, initial efforts at ITMVT focused on mechanical analog calculating machines due to the political influence of its director, General Nikolai Brevich, who doubted the near-future possibility of reliable electronic general computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Voicing concerns against this party directive during the Stalin era was dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Renegade Progress and Bureaucratic Infighting
A breakthrough came in Ukraine when Sergey Lebedev, director of the Kiev Electrotechnical Institute, learned of American digital computer efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Lebedev, an electrical engineer and war hero, independently built his "little calculating machine," the Mali Electrono Machina (MESM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Despite its ironic name (it had 6,000 vacuum tubes and occupied 60 square meters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, MESM successfully solved its first real calculation in December 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

MESM impressed future Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, allowing ITMVT scientists to depose Nikolai Brevich and proceed with a more powerful digital computer, the Bolshaya Electronia (BESM-1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. BESM-1 was projected to be one of the world's fastest computers, capable of 8,000-10,000 operations per second, significantly outperforming America's UNIVAC I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

However, ITMVT struggled to deliver BESM-1 due to bureaucratic infighting. The Ministry of Machine and Instrument Engineering's SKB245 institute, initially focused on mechanical analog computers, decided to build its own digital computer, the Strela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Although computationally inferior to BESM-1 (2 kiloflops vs. 8-10 kiloflops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, Strela's supporters argued its capabilities were sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

With Stalin's blessing, the two institutes competed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This competition hampered BESM-1's development. The Ministry of Machine and Instrument Engineering, responsible for making cathode ray tubes needed for BESM-1's memory, refused to supply them, forcing the BESM-1 team to use inferior mercury storage tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. A 1951 state commission ultimately chose Strela over BESM-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. However, users soon found Strela unreliable and unable to solve complex quadratic equations essential for fission development, leading the head of the Soviet nuclear effort to request BESM replacements by 1955 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This early episode foreshadowed future challenges in [[soviet_computer_development_history | Soviet computer development history]].

## Systemic Production and Economic Challenges

While the Soviets successfully developed a first-generation computer as fast as the West's, the true battle was lost at the production level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. In 1959, Soviet computer production was valued at $59 million, compared to the US's $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. By 1964, the US produced 1.36 billion semiconductor pieces, while the Soviet Union managed only 200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This massive disparity highlighted the [[challenges in Russian semiconductor manufacturing | challenges in Russian semiconductor manufacturing]].

Under the Soviet command economy, computers failed to reach their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Limited Demand**: Unlike the West, where commercial and industrial demand (e.g., for computer-aided automation in steelmaking) drove innovation, Soviet military demand was finite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Soviet steelmakers, for example, only needed to meet quotas, with no incentive for steel quality or production efficiency, thus limiting the demand for productivity-improving computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Lack of Incentives**: Soviet computer makers had little incentive to produce productivity-improving machines or to provide necessary training and customer service for their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Resource Allocation Issues**: Ministers were reluctant to risk their quotas by allocating limited resources to computer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This resulted in factories frequently failing to receive necessary funding, materials, and talent. For instance, in 1958, the Penza computer plant, one of only two in the country, requested 50 computer experts but received only seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

This was a systemic issue reflecting [[soviet industrial growth and technological lag | Soviet industrial growth and technological lag]] in distributing new revolutionary technologies across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## The Third Generation and the Copying Decision

The transition to second-generation computers using transistors in the West (starting in 1959) further widened the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. While the Soviets developed their own second-generation computers like the BESM-6 (their first supercomputer, entering production in 1967) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, they remained two years behind the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

The true [[soviet_versus_western_computing_capabilities | computing gap]] became apparent with the third generation of computers, powered by integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. IBM's System/360, announced in 1964, revolutionized the industry with its compatibility across hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. In the Soviet Union, public criticism mounted, with newspapers like *Izvestia* (1964) and *Pravda* (1966) highlighting the disjointed state of the industry and its inability to meet national computing requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

### The ES Project and Its Consequences
In 1967, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued Resolution 1184-20 to consolidate its computing industry and produce the "Unified System" (ES) series of third-generation computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. This resolution dramatically increased the budget and called for the construction of numerous new plants to produce 20,000 computers by 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

To achieve this, the responsible ministries decided to copy the American IBM/360 design for ES compatibility with existing software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This [[strategic_decisions_in_soviet_computing_industry | decision was controversial]]:
*   **"Intellectual Colony" Concerns**: Critics argued it would make the USSR an "intellectual colony of the West" and hinder the development of native innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Documentation**: The US government forbade IBM from exporting 360 systems to the Soviet Union, forcing the Soviets to acquire systems through espionage or intermediaries and lacking proper documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **Missed Opportunities**: The UK's ICL offered to share technology and documentation for their 360-compatible System 4 line, providing a path to software compatibility while retaining some industrial sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. However, this would have delayed the project by at least 1.5 years, a prospect deemed politically unpalatable given the existing computer gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
*   **Political Fallout**: The decision to copy led to resignations of prominent computer scientists, including Sergey Lebedev, who attempted to reverse the decision and whose efforts are said to have hastened his death in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

The ES project involved over 100 organizations, 46,000 scientists, and 300,000 workers across Eastern Europe, producing over 15,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Much of the hardware was reverse-engineered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, but peripherals, especially disk storage, remained inferior to Western alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. While 360 compatibility initially accelerated Soviet capabilities, shrinking the gap from 10-15 years to 4-6 years by the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>, this short-term gain led to long-term loss.

## The Permanent Gap
By the 1980s, the Soviet industry struggled to reverse-engineer increasingly complex Western computers, widening the gap once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The reliance on copying meant the Soviets lost the native industrial capacity to develop new technologies on their own, making the gap permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. Industrial productivity suffered as aging computers from the 1970s (like the ES-1022, based on 1965 technology) frequently broke down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Linkage to foreign technology also caused issues when the West levied export bans during international crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

Ultimately, the fall of the Soviet computing industry was a story of wasted talents, lost progress, foolish short-term [[strategic_decisions_in_soviet_computing_industry | strategic choices]] made by politicians over scientists, and the inherent limits of centralized planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

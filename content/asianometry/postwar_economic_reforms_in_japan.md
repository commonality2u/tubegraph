From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Japan's postwar economic landscape was dramatically reshaped by a series of radical reforms that dismantled the power of the [[zaibatsu_and_japanese_economy | zaibatsu]] and paved the way for the nation's economic miracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. These reforms were initiated by the Japanese government during the war to maintain social stability and its grip on power, and were continued and expanded by the Allied occupation authorities after the war's end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Decline of the Zaibatsu

The [[zaibatsu_and_japanese_economy | zaibatsu]], large industrial combines that had practically run Japan's economy for decades and amassed plutocratic wealth, faced significant challenges even before the war's conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

*   **War Damage** War damage crippled their most productive assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Government Regulations** The government began regulating rents, wages, and land prices, further reducing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Financial markets were also intervened in to sell more war bonds, which reduced the returns on the families' financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Land Reform** Starting in 1938, agricultural land was confiscated and redistributed from landlords to tenant farmers to stimulate food production for the war effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. These land reform policies continued after the war, carried on by the occupation authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Capital Tax** In 1946, a tax on capital was instituted to pay off government debt, with [[zaibatsu_and_japanese_economy | zaibatsu]] families seeing their taxable assets taxed at an 85% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Sumitomo Kuchizaymo, head of the Sumitomo [[zaibatsu_and_japanese_economy | zaibatsu]], lost 89% of his taxable assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Dissolution of Zaibatsu** In September 1946, trust-busting economists, concerned about the sprawling nature of these companies, ordered the dissolution of the [[zaibatsu_and_japanese_economy | zaibatsu]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Ten [[zaibatsu_and_japanese_economy | zaibatsu]] families were targeted, including the "big four" â€” Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Yasuda, and Sumitomo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. The Holding Company Liquidation Commission (HCLC) seized stocks and bonds worth 1.25 billion yen from the holding companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Executive Purge** In early 1947, the HCLC ordered nearly 2,000 top family executives and hundreds of businesses to relinquish their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. A second purge in January 1948 identified 56 family heads, removed 309 relatives, and forced 2,798 additional high-ranking executives to resign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The HCLC also acquired an additional 1.2 billion yen in personally held stocks and bonds from these individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Hyperinflation** While [[zaibatsu_and_japanese_economy | zaibatsu]] families received cash compensation for seized assets, these proceeds were deposited into a national bank with withdrawal limits to prevent re-acquisition of controlling stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Triple-digit annual inflation until 1951 caused the real value of their cash holdings to plummet by 97% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

As a result, the wealth and income of Japan's richest families were drastically reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. By 1950, the top 1% of highest-earning Japanese derived half of their income from employment, indicating a significant shift from passive income generated by their vast assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

## Democratization of Stocks

A significant side effect of the [[zaibatsu_and_japanese_economy | zaibatsu]] dissolution was the broad democratization of Japanese stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. In 1946, the [[zaibatsu_and_japanese_economy | zaibatsu]] owned one out of every four stocks; by 1950, this had fallen to one out of twenty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

## Shift in Economic Control and Strategy

While the occupation authorities stopped short of a total dismemberment of the [[zaibatsu_and_japanese_economy | zaibatsu]] companies themselves, the most consequential long-term effect was the shift in economic control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. The government bureaucracy, specifically the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), gained de facto policy and guidance control over Japan's massive corporate apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.

Previously, [[zaibatsu_and_japanese_economy | zaibatsu]] families focused on dominating the domestic market, suppressing competition, and avoiding the export market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. The postwar "reset" allowed MITI to push Japanese companies onto a new, pro-export industrialist path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. With new generations of professional managers, these industries focused outwards, pioneering a "catch-up strategy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. This strategy involved acquiring and mastering foreign technology, then using that expertise to create products for the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. This export discipline was crucial in creating the [[japanese_exportdriven_economic_miracle | Japanese economic miracle]] of the 1950s and 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

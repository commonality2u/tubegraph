[[history_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] initially exploded onto the Silicon Valley scene with an incredible [[sun_microsystems_business_model_and_strategy | business model]] and astounding growth, becoming one of the Valley's most important and iconic companies, worth some $140 billion at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, over time, the company's brilliant run burned itself into a husk, leading to a long and painful decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Early Challenges and Missed Opportunities

By the late 1980s, [[history_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] began to face problems with its critical partner, Motorola, which supplied Sun's microprocessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Motorola's single design team struggled to keep up with Sun's demands, taking two years to fix a memory bug and similarly long to increase clock speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This prompted Sun to design its own microprocessor, the SPARC CPU, based on a RISC architecture that promised four-fold speed improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### The Unix Wars

Encouraged by the success of its Network File System (NFS) standard, Sun partnered with AT&T in 1987 to collaborate on [[the_commercial_evolution_and_significance_of_unix_in_the_technology_industry | Unix]], aiming to unify its complicated tree and expand into the broader consumer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. However, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and other Unix licensees rebelled, fearing what Sun and AT&T might do with Unix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. They formed the Open Software Foundation (OSF), which Sun's Scott McNeely called the "Opposed Sun Forever Foundation," attracting vendors and developers by promoting true openness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Sun and AT&T countered by forming Unix International <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

These "Unix Wars" had lasting effects on Sun and its competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>:
*   **Crippled Microprocessor Strategy:** Sun tried to license its RISC-based SPARC chip designs but insisted on retaining control over the IP, which prevented widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This contrasts with the later success of ARM, founded a few years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Stalled Software Progress:** The war stalled technical progress on [[the_commercial_evolution_and_significance_of_unix_in_the_technology_industry | Unix]] itself and divided its community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Although Sun and AT&T eventually produced Solaris, neither side created a truly competitive commercial product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### Rise of Microsoft Windows NT

The Unix Wars inadvertently opened the door for Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. In 1993, Microsoft released Windows NT 3.1, an operating system for workstations and server computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Windows NT incorporated elements from Unix and IBM to create a 32-bit, business-oriented OS with networking and file sharing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. It was "the right product at the right time" as Unix was distracted and facing legal issues, and Linux was not yet desktop-ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Microsoft became the dominant player for many businesses, and Sun's competitors like IBM and HP rapidly adopted Windows NT for their workstations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Sun, however, refused to adopt Windows, believing Unix was a far superior product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

As Windows NT (and later Windows 95) combined with Intel's CPU improvements, they began to eat into Sun's original workstation market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

## Shift to Enterprise Server Market

Throughout the 1990s, Sun shifted to a more vertically integrated [[sun_microsystems_business_model_and_strategy | business strategy]], selling complete systems centered on SPARC hardware and Solaris software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. As Microsoft and Intel encroached on the high-end workstation market, Sun moved upwards into the Enterprise Server Market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

In 1996, Sun acquired Cray Business Systems, adopting Cray's SPARC and Solaris technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Sun's vertically integrated stack, from networking to processor to operating system, proved perfect for the server market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Solaris's symmetric multiprocessing capabilities allowed a large number of SPARC processors to be added for easy scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. While Intel's individual processors might be faster, Sun servers could outperform them on a system basis by accommodating up to 100 processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. With the rise of the internet in the 1990s, this web-connected server market grew even larger than Sun's old workstation business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

Many major companies, including eBay, Yahoo, Dell, Bloomberg, Merrill Lynch, and even Microsoft, adopted Sun Enterprise servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. This led to Sun's revenues growing 50% to 60% each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

## Internet Bubble Burst and Financial Troubles

The internet server business proved to be a double-edged sword for Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. When the internet bubble popped, Sun's multi-billion dollar business was sliced by nearly half, leading to thousands of Sun systems being resold at fire sale prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Management struggled through several unprofitable years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. After profits of $1.85 billion in 2000 and $927 million in 2001, Sun lost $587 million in 2002 and $3.4 billion in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

Research and development costs remained persistently high due to Sun's need to support its technology ecosystems, including SPARC, Solaris, and Java, which alone required 4,000 developers a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

## The Rise of Open Source

While Sun used the term "open" compared to its proprietary competitors in the 1970s, it was not "truly open" by modern definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Until 2005, one could not simply download and view the Solaris source code; a contract was required, and even then, not all code was visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. This led to frustration and gave rise to the grassroots open source movement, personified by Linux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

Throughout the 1990s, Linux evolved from a hobbyist's toy to a system robust enough for business-critical production environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. Businesses found they could scale by creating clusters of Linux servers using commodity hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Widespread Linux adoption ultimately annihilated Sun's Enterprise server business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

## Attempts at Open Sourcing and Acquisition

Throughout the 2000s, [[history_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] attempted to return to its "open" roots by open-sourcing its technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. They acquired various technologies like the database MySQL and data storage company StorageTek, often paying too much for assets that made little profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

With the global financial crisis roiling the industry, investors grew tired of the endless losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. In 2009, Oracle bought Sun for $7.4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. From 2000 to the acquisition, Sun had lost over $10 billion in revenue and more than 90% of its stock value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. The company has since been digested by Oracle, and its products rebranded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

## Conclusion: Refusal to Adapt

Sun was known as a brash company that did not play nicely with competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. While this attitude worked during its rapid growth in the 1980s and 1990s, it ultimately contributed to its downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. As technology trends changed, Sun refused to adapt, sign on, or collaborate, becoming "this lonely outpost of technology far from the Leading Edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

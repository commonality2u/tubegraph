A Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is an integrated circuit that can be reprogrammed after manufacture to emulate a digital circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. FPGAs are not the first devices with this capability, but they are the most commercially successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Core Applications

FPGAs excel in specific scenarios where traditional methods fall short:

*   **Prototyping New Functionalities**
    They are great for prototyping new functionalities before mass production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Historically, options for prototyping included using Transistor-Transistor Logic (TTL) chips, which were limited by board size and power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The alternative was getting a chip built to order, now called an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, which involved substantial upfront costs, photo masks, and months of fabrication time, with no ability to edit mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. FPGAs address this need for a reprogrammable circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

*   **Serving Rare Use Cases**
    FPGAs are also ideal for rare use cases that are not economical for a custom chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It typically doesn't make economic sense to pursue an ASIC unless the use case is quite large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Modern Industrial Applications

Today, FPGAs are widely utilized across a variety of industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. As [[Comparison between FPGAs and other programmable devices like PROMs and PLAs | ASICs]] become increasingly expensive to design and fabricate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, FPGAs have filled a valuable market gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

Key sectors include:
*   **Aerospace** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>
*   **Military** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>
*   **Telecom** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>

FPGAs continue to gain new functionalities, expanding into areas like:
*   **AI Processing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>
*   **Data Centers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>

Their "Swiss army knife" functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a> reflects the semiconductor industry's innovative powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

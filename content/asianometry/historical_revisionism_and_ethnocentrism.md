Han ethnic supremacy is a growing concern on China's internet and in cultural discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Initially dismissible as fringe views, these are real people expressing their real opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This trend is considered troubling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Defining "Han" and Supremacist Views

Defining what it means to be Han is a complex question, similar to defining "white" in America, where definitions have changed over time (e.g., Italians, Irish, Jewish were not always considered white) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Han ethnicity is subject to the whims of the current era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Being Han is not about a distinct nationality, ethnicity, or race, but rather a constructed bundle of items, like adherence to Confucian values or certain rites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It's often described as an "I know it when I see it" phenomenon, proven by the existence of groups like the Hakka and Cantonese within the Han designation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

In contrast, Han supremacists simplify this, viewing "Han-ness" as a single, mono-race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. They assert that "Han people are the core race in China" and that the "interests of the Han race are one in one with those of China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. They claim Hans have "five thousand years of direct racial inheritance" and "their blood is one of the purest in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This contrasts with the genetic reality that Han people are a "deeply intermixed breed," having migrated and mixed for generations, even more so than other races globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Historical Context of Han Nationalism

For over 1000 years, China has been ruled longer by foreigners than by Han people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Han nationalism played a role in overthrowing the Qing Dynasty and establishing both the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Centuries of rule by the Manchu people grated against the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Chinese elites seeking power would denounce the "furry and horned Manchu people" to unite the "pure Han race" against enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

When the ROC came to power, Sun Yet-sen recognized that continued feelings of Han supremacy could divide the country, as other multi-ethnic empires like Russia and Austria-Hungary were splitting during World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. To avoid this fate for Qing-era China, Sun and the Guomindan party promoted racial harmony, symbolized by the five-colored flag of the Republic of China and the principle of "five races under one union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. While the ROC sometimes advocated for a single unified Chinese race, Han ethnocentrism remained a persistent governance issue and a major social problem leading to the suppression of ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## The Communist Party's Approach to Ethnic Minorities

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) gained support from China's ethnic minorities who were disillusioned with the Republic of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Ethnic minorities became a critical constituency for the CCP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Mao Zedong strongly valued China's ethnic minorities, acknowledging that "reactionary rulers chiefly from the Han nationality sowed feelings of estrangement among our various nationalities and bullied the minority peoples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. He advocated for "extensive and sustained efforts to educate both the cadres and the masses in our proletarian nationality policy" and frequent review of relations between Han and minority nationalities <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

The PRC dedicates significant attention to ethnic minority and racial harmony issues for both ideological and practical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Although the CCP's higher ranks are predominantly men, they have done an admirable job of promoting high-performing cadres from ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

In the 1950s, the CCP helped create and codify China's ethnic minorities, sending teams to locate, classify, and protect non-Han ethnic cultures, resulting in 56 separate nationalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The People's Congress then implemented affirmative action policies and preferential treatment to help minorities achieve parity with the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. These benefits include:
*   Regional ethnic autonomous states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
*   Dedicated museums, parks, schools, and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
*   Preferential treatment in China's national testing exam (Gaokao), where minorities in western China might need 200 points compared to 500 for Han people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>
*   An exception to the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>

Some of these policies are also reflected in Taiwan, where recognized aboriginal tribes receive similar college exam benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. These policies were introduced to address significant gaps between ethnic minorities and the Han, akin to the white-black gap in America, concerning income, wealth, and employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Consequences and Han Resentment

Despite these policies, the generation gaps persist, and the policies have largely succeeded in "cultivating resentment" from the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Han supremacists believe the Han majority is the "crucial driver of the Chinese nation and its glorious history" but feel they are not treated equally to ethnic minorities, seeing themselves as "part of the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

Such views thrive in "dark corners of the Chinese internet," with dozens of Han culture forums and websites emerging in China, Taiwan, and the overseas Chinese diaspora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. A notable example was "Han Now" (now closed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. These platforms advocate for revitalizing specific aspects of Han Chinese culture while rejecting others for their non-Han origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. For instance, they reject Qing-era clothing like the Manchu *chi pao* or *makwa* (horse jacket), instead promoting [[The Hanfu Movement and Cultural Revitalization | Hanfu]] worn before "alien rule" by the Manchu conquest of the Ming Dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The [[The Hanfu Movement and Cultural Revitalization | Hanfu Movement]] went mainstream largely because the clothes were seen as "cute," initially stopping at "nice cosplay" and a way for people to connect with their culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. However, the [[The Hanfu Movement and Cultural Revitalization | Hanfu Movement]] and similar sites served as "gateway drugs" for more extreme versions of Han supremacism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

## Historical Revisionism and the Manchu

Han ethnocentrists particularly dislike the Manchu people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. They have actively sought to revise historical views of the Qing and Ming dynasties, painting the Qing Dynasty and its Manchu leaders as "very bloodthirsty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Their narrative claims the Manchu rolled back Ming Dynasty advancements, stole Han wealth, butchered Hans, and made China a "backwards country," thus enabling Western invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. They compare the Manchu to "the British in India," viewing them as colonists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. They cite historical records of deaths during the Qing conquest of the Ming Dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

However, the Qing conquest was a "long, complicated series of wars" with many instances of Han fighting against Han <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Boiling this down to a simplistic narrative of "bad Manchu victimizing innocent Han" is seen as hijacking history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This historical revisionism often involves "insane Manchu conspiracy theories" which do not follow regular rules of logic, a common thread with white supremacists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. The goal is to reject the celebration of 300 years of China's history and attribute its decline to a "foreign face," thereby absolving Han people of any blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Criticisms of CCP Policies and Societal Impact

The CCP's affirmative action policies receive legitimate criticism online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Many perceive a "quiet deal" where ethnic minorities receive special privileges in exchange for not seeking independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The two policies most resented by netizens are the national examination benefits and the one-child policy exemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

The one-child policy exemption has increased the proportion of ethnic minorities in China from 3% in 1949 to 8% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. While Hans still number 1.2 billion, supremacists view this as the Han people "conducting their own self-destruction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Coupled with easier national examination thresholds for minorities, this fuels a perception that there are "more ethnic minorities running around and they are dumber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

Incidents of ethnic violence, such as the late 2000s riots in Urumqi, also trigger anti-minority sentiment among Han supremacists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. A common complaint is that authorities allow ethnic minorities to attack or rob Han people in the name of national unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Parallels and Challenges

These racial issues are common challenges for any government with minority and majority populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. While China is often seen as a single-race monolith, ethnic minority problems cause "headaches galore" for the Chinese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

There are parallels to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>:
*   **Inclusive Vision:** The U.S. founding fathers created a nation meant to bind peoples of different races and creeds under concepts like freedom and pursuit of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Similarly, China has an inclusive school of thought advocating acceptance into Chinese society and even the Han race by practicing Confucian values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, believing "China is a nation of many races and we are all in this together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Divisive Schools of Thought:** The U.S. faces darker schools of thought, some arguing America's success is based solely on Christianity and Christian values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, and others going further to argue for American white ethnocentrism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. China faces its own version: a darker school advocating an "inherent gap" between Han people and "the barbarians"—a label with deep historical significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. They believe other races are "born barbarians" and attempting to assimilate them would be "a fool's errand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

This problem is not confined to China but exists in Chinese communities globally, including America, Hong Kong, and Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. It is most troubling in areas with significant Han majorities and substantial minority populations, such as China and Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

In China, the government attempts to manage these concerns and foster cross-ethnic unity by creating an "us versus them" mentality, pitting "China versus the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. By portraying all Westerners as foreigners and encouraging an "acceptable level of anti-foreign energy," the CCP aims to suppress Han supremacism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. While this tactic might work, its long-term health is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Han supremacism is considered a serious and widespread problem, not just a niche group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

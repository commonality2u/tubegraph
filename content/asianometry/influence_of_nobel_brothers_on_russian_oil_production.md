The Nobel Brothers played a pivotal role in the [[soviet_union_early_oil_industry_development | early oil industry development]] of Russia, particularly in the city of Baku, which rose to become one of the world's leading oil production sites throughout the 1800s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>. At its peak in the 1880s, oil production in Baku reached one-third of America's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. By 1914, 90% of Russia's oil production originated from Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>.

## Nobel Brothers' Entry into Russian Oil

The four Nobel Brothers—Emil, Ludwig, Robert, and Alfred—were foreign pioneers in Baku's oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:11">[01:34:11]</a>. They had pre-existing ties to the Russian Empire as arms dealers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>. Their involvement in oil began in 1873 when Ludwig Nobel provided his brother Robert 25,000 rubles to procure Russian Walnut Wood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>. Instead, Robert used the funds to purchase an oil refinery and establish a small company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:20">[01:54:20]</a>. Recognizing the significant opportunities, he brought Ludwig into the venture, and together they founded the Nobel Brothers oil production company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:07">[02:01:07]</a>.

## Contributions and Impact

The Nobel Brothers' company, *Brand Nobel*, became one of the largest oil companies globally during its 38-year presence in Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:07">[02:09:07]</a>. Russia's modern oil industry is said to trace back to the systems and practices they implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:10">[02:15:10]</a>.

Key contributions include:
*   **Infrastructure Development** With the backing of the Czar, Nobel Brothers introduced oil pipelines and tankers, which significantly improved the economic transport of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:28">[02:21:28]</a>. Many of these innovations were implemented despite objections from local communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:11">[02:30:11]</a>.
*   **Financial Success** Ludwig Nobel, as the major shareholder, amassed the greatest fortune among the Nobel Brothers from this enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:25">[02:34:25]</a>. Alfred Nobel, while not directly involved in operations, provided technical advice and held a substantial share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:20">[02:41:20]</a>.
*   **Industry Growth** Baku's thriving private oil industry flourished partly due to a corporate-friendly shift in Russian tsarist policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:15">[02:50:15]</a>. Industrialists aimed to export millions of barrels of production and challenge the global Standard Oil monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. However, a lack of funds and internal divisions between bureaucrats and businessmen prevented this opportunity from fully materializing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:16">[03:02:16]</a>.

## Decline and Nationalization

The Baku oil industry eventually began to stagnate, with overall oil production declining from a peak of 11.5 million metric tons in 1901 to 9.4 million metric tons by 1916 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:01">[03:13:01]</a>. Russia's exports also fell, never exceeding a million tons after 1904 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:36">[03:23:36]</a>.

The rise of the Bolsheviks marked a dramatic shift. In 1919, British oil companies, including Shell, attempted to annex Russia's oil regions as the Empire collapsed, but the British government refused armed intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:05">[03:32:05]</a>. As a result, Western oil companies suffered massive financial losses when the Soviets nationalized all their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:16">[03:52:16]</a>. Shell alone lost approximately 171.4 million rubles of British Capital, with French and German investors also losing millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:09">[03:59:09]</a>.

Following the [[impact_of_nationalization_on_foreign_oil_companies | nationalization]], Nobel Brothers shrewdly sold half of their Russian oil assets for an estimated seven to nine million dollars to Standard Oil of New Jersey, the precursor to Exxon Mobil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:18">[07:27:18]</a>. Standard Oil made this purchase based on a calculated bet that the Soviet Union would collapse, allowing Nobel to reclaim their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:11">[07:40:11]</a>.

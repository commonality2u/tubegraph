Japan's [[rise_and_decline_of_japans_sharp_corporation | Sharp Corporation]], known for a range of [[sharps_iconic_products_and_market_competition | iconic products]], found itself increasingly focused on the highly competitive display business at the turn of the century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Early LCD Innovations

Sharp's journey into Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) began with a push for more efficient calculators.
In January 1969, a Sharp researcher learned about RCA's Dynamic Scattering Mode (DSM) Liquid Crystal Displays (LCDs) through an NHK documentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Scientists had first observed liquid crystals in 1880, noting their unique phase between liquid and solid and their light-refracting properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. RCA researchers discovered their electro-optic characteristics in the early 1960s, leading to a method for electrically controlling light reflection for displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

However, for calculator use, the technology needed better contrast and room-temperature operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Sharp approached RCA for assistance, offering to fund development, but RCA declined, seeing LCDs as a distraction from their core Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. RCA also had concerns about LCD's immaturity, cost, and yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

In 1971, Sharp licensed some of RCA's patents and assembled a team (S-734) to integrate a DSM LCD display into a calculator within 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. After extensive research, in June 1973, Sharp released the LC-mate EL-805 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. This revolutionary calculator was only 2.1 centimeters thick, 12 times thinner than competitors, used 1/9000th of the power of existing models, and could operate for 100 hours on a single charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

Sharp continued its LCD research, and by the mid-1980s, learned that IBM had identified Thin-Film Transistor (TFT) LCD as a potential replacement for CRTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. By 1987, Sharp successfully produced a 14-inch full-color, full-motion LCD display, leapfrogging competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. In 1991, they debuted Japan's first wall-mounted television, the 9EHC1, which signaled the future of display technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

## Strategic Pivot and Initial Success

By the late 1990s, Sharp's profits were declining, with net income falling to 24.8 billion yen in 1998, a nearly 50% year-over-year decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. LCD panels and related products were the company's "one bright spot," responsible for 30% of its revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

New President Katsuhiko Machida, who took office in 1998, sought to "streamline Sharp and reposition its LCD business at its very center," calling it "the crystal clear company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. He stated that "every Sharp product will be related to LCD technology" to improve brand perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This meant ditching their venerable CRT television business, which dated back to 1953, and going "all in" on LCD televisions, launching the Aquos TV brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

This bold move initially paid off. In 2001, Aquos quickly captured 80% global market share in the nascent LCD TV market, generating nearly $400 million USD in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. By mid-2003, Aquos dominated the Japanese market with 60% share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, and in 2004, Sharp held a leading 33% market share in the overall LCD industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

## Challenges and Decline

Despite early success, [[sharps_iconic_products_and_market_competition | market competition]] from rivals, particularly Samsung, caught up rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. In early 2002, Samsung surprised the industry by being the first to produce leading-edge 5th generation LCDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

To maintain its lead, Sharp invested billions of yen into new TFT LCD factories across Japan, most notably the Kamiyama plant in Mie prefecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. Completed in two phases (2004 and 2006), it cost a cumulative $4 billion USD and produced over a million panels annually, making it the world's largest at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>. This represented a significant bet on Japan-based production, as many other Japanese companies had offshored their LCD manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

However, the enormous investments in Kamiyama strained Sharp's finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. The plant came online concurrently with other massive facilities built by AU Optronics, Sony, Samsung, and LG, leading to an industry-wide oversupply of LCD panels in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. As a result, the price of a 32-inch TV panel plummeted from $865 in 2004 to $149 by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Sharp's TV market share consequently fell from 80% to under 10% throughout the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

Sharp tried to shift focus to selling more LCD panels to other businesses, aiming for 50% external sales, and continued to invest heavily in production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>. This strategy led to Phase 2 of the Kamiyama plant and further cuts in other divisions like home appliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. By 2006, LCDs accounted for half of Sharp Corporation's entire revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

Despite record high sales in fiscal year ending March 2008, the external sales target for LCD panels never exceeded 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. Competition from Taiwan, South Korea, and China intensified, making Sharp's massive LCD investments unprofitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

### Sakai Plant and Partnership Failure

In 2007, Sharp announced the construction of new factories in Sakai, Osaka prefecture, projected to cost $3.4 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. Sharp sought buyers for these panels, particularly Sony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. In February 2008, Sony agreed to take a 33% ownership share in the Sakai factories (named Sharp Display Products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

However, Sharp's failure to manage relations between its TV and display panel divisions, where its own Aquos TV sales competed with Sony, led to shortages and delays for Sony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. Sony eventually did not go through with its 33% purchase, never owning more than 7% and eventually selling its entire stake back to Sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Efforts to sell larger panels to the U.S. market (60-inch TVs) also did not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

### Financial Crisis and Further Losses

The [[impact_of_global_financial_trends_on_sharps_operations | global financial crisis]] in 2008 led to a collapse in sales and increased losses for Sharp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. In March 2009, Sharp announced its first net loss since going public in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. Despite admitting errors in investing in local production, they continued to focus on LCDs as the core of their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. By 2009, Sharp's TV market share had fallen to 6-7%, placing them fifth globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>, and the $3 billion Sakai plant's operating utilization fell to less than 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. The inability to balance panel supply and TV businesses resulted in losses in both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

By March 2012, Sharp's sales had declined by $10 billion from 2008, leading to a net loss of over $5 billion, and the company nearly faced bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. Furthermore, Sharp missed several critical industry transitions, including the shift to LED-backlit LCD screens and OLED technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. In March 2013, the company reported a staggering $5 billion loss, leading to the departure of its top leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

## Acquisition and Reorientation

In 2012, Foxconn, a Taiwanese electronics giant, bought a 9.9% stake in Sharp for $854 million and a larger share in Sakai Display <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Foxconn's interest stemmed from its strategy to acquire manufacturing control across the supply chain, with displays being the most expensive component in electronics gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

After several more years of losses and declining market share, Sharp finally accepted Foxconn's offer to purchase a controlling 66% stake for $6.2 billion in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. This [[mergers_and_acquisitions_involving_sharp | acquisition]] marked the first foreign takeover of a leading Japanese electronics firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>.

Under Foxconn's leadership, Sharp's new CEO, Tai Jung-woo, cut costs, closed unprofitable overseas ventures, reduced employees, and moved production out of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. In its first full year under Taiwanese management, Sharp turned a profit for the first time in four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. Tai reoriented the company towards producing branded electronics products and began rebuilding Sharp's semiconductor manufacturing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>.

Sharp's past success was attributed to using technology to produce the right products at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. However, its later over-reliance and unwavering confidence in LCD technology, despite the display panel industry becoming a "brutal grinding business with low margins and high insecurity," ultimately contributed to its decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>.

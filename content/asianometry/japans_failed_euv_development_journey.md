In 2019, [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] shipped its first high-volume [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] system, marking the completion of a long and winding road and shifting the semiconductor lithography industry's focus from Asia towards Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This was a significant loss for Japan, which had previously led the lithography industry before [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]]'s rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Despite inventing [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]], Japanese companies were unable to commercialize it in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Japan's journey in [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV development]] illustrates the immense [[challenges_in_developing_euv_systems | challenge]] of producing commercial-ready [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Origins of EUV in Japan

[[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] was invented in Japan in 1986 by Dr. Hiro Kinoshita at NTT, who successfully printed a circuit pattern using [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] light and a reflective optic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. At the time, [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] was one of several potential next-generation lithography candidates, alongside Electron Beam direct write, proximity X-ray, ion beam projection, Electron Beam projection, and 157 nanometer fluorine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | Japanese lithography industry]] studied all these options, but [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] was not their initial preference, with most early progress reports focusing on proximity X-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This assessment was shared by others, as the Department of Energy's early [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] project concluded without industry follow-up, and as late as 1997, Sematech ranked [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] fourth, behind X-ray in first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## American Intervention and Japanese Response

American semiconductor leader Intel, however, took notice after seeing demonstrations in Japan and at Department of Energy labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Intel provided bridge funding to prevent the disbandment of the DOE [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] project R&D team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. A year later, Intel and other American semiconductor manufacturers founded EUV LLC, an industry-wide consortium aimed at providing the estimated $60 million per year in R&D necessary to commercialize [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV lithography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Intel's interest and the formation of EUV LLC caught the Japanese by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Due to American restrictions on foreign participation (a long geopolitical history), Japanese lithography makers Nikon and Canon could not directly join EUV LLC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. They were, however, allowed to participate in design reviews and working groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This forced Japan to rapidly pivot and pursue its own path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. In 1998, a year after EUV LLC's founding, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched its own [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV lithography]] program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Japan's EUV Development Plan

The Japanese [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | EUV lithography development plan]] was structured in three phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>:

1.  **Phase One (1998-2001)**: Focused on developing basic technologies for [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV lithography]] and its three system parts: the exposure tool, the mask, and the resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The government-funded research organization responsible was ASET (Association of Super Advanced Electronic Technologies), a multi-year consortium fully funded by MITI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
2.  **Phase Two (2001-2003)**: A different organization was to take over, turning ASET's raw technology into a working prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | Japan semiconductor industry]] would contribute partial financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
3.  **Phase Three (leading into 2006)**: The [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | Japanese semiconductor industry]] was to transform the prototype into a commercialized product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. SALID (Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies), an industry-funded R&D consortium, along with Japanese lithography makers Nikon and Canon, were presumably in charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## Technical [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | Challenges]] and Organizational Complexity

The [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV lithography]] machine's three basic systems (exposure tool, mask, and resist) required brand new, substantial engineering work with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Exposure Tool
ASET initially focused on optics manufacturing, including mirror multi-layers and cleaning, as well as metrology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This meant ASET could not work on the exposure tool's light source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This critical task was reassigned to a new industry organization founded in 2001, the Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography System Development Association (EUVA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

EUVA included both academia and industry, with five Japanese equipment companies (Ushio, Canon, Nikon, Komatsu, and Gigaphoton) and four semiconductor manufacturers (Toshiba, NEC, Fujitsu, and Renesas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Academic partners included Himeji Institute of Technology, Kumamoto University, Miyazaki University, and Osaka University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

EUVA researched two approaches for producing [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>:
1.  **Laser-produced plasma (LPP)**: Firing a laser at a material to turn it into plasma, which emits [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This is the approach [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] eventually chose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
2.  **Discharge-produced plasma (DPP)**: Creating a cloud of material and then firing high-powered sparks between two electrodes to create light-emitting plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. EUVA researched both, with LPP at the Hiro Scott Research Center and DPP at the Gotemba Research Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Photoresist
ASET also handled the [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] photoresist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The major [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | challenge]] was [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] light's high absorbability, meaning it could only penetrate about 700 angstroms into resist layers, far short of the traditional 4,000 angstroms needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This necessitated the development of new "thin layer imaging" (TLI) technologies, for which ASET collaborated with Himeji Institute of Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.# Japan's Failed EUV Development Journey

In 2019, [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] finally shipped the first high-volume [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] system, completing a long and winding road <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This move completed the semiconductor lithography industry's shift away from Asia towards Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It was a particularly big loss for the Japanese, as Japanese companies had led the lithography industry before [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]]'s emergence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Despite [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] being invented in Japan, Japanese companies were unable to commercialize it in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Japan's failed [[japans_semiconductor_industry and EUV | EUV development journey]] is fascinating, as it illustrates the incredible [[challenges_in_developing_euv_systems | challenge]] of producing commercial-ready [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Early Japanese EUV Research

[[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] was invented in Japan in 1986, when Dr. Hiro Kinoshita, then at NTT, announced he had successfully printed a circuit pattern using [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] light and a reflective optic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. At the time, [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] was just one of several potential next-generation lithography candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Other options included Electron Beam direct write lithography, proximity X-ray, ion beam projection, Electron Beam projection, and 157 nanometers fluorine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | Japanese lithography industry]] studied all these, but [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] was not their main preference; they seemed to be leaning towards proximity X-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This assessment was not unique to Japan, as the Department of Energy's early [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] project was ending, and as late as 1997, Sematech had evaluated [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] in fourth place, with X-ray in first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## American Influence and Japan's Response

The American semiconductor leader, Intel, however, saw demonstrations in Japan and at Department of Energy labs and was impressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. With the DOE [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] Project R&D team on the verge of disbanding, Intel provided bridge funding to keep the team together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. A year later, Intel and other American semiconductor manufacturers founded EUV LLC, an industry-wide consortium to provide the estimated $60 million per year in R&D to commercialize [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV lithography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Intel's interest in [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] and EUV LLC's founding caught the Japanese by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Due to American restrictions on foreign participation, Japan's lithography makers, Nikon and Canon, could not directly join EUV LLC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. However, they were allowed to participate in design reviews and working groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This prompted the Japanese to rapidly pivot and pursue their own path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. In 1998, a year after EUV LLC's founding, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) began its own [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV lithography]] program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Japan's EUV Development Phases

Japan's [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | EUV lithography development plan]] had three phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>:
*   **Phase 1 (1998-2001)**: Focused on developing the basic technologies for [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV lithography]] and its three system parts: the exposure tool, the mask, and the resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The government-funded research organization in charge was ASET (Association of Super Advanced Electronic Technologies), a multi-year research consortium fully funded by MITI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Phase 2 (2001-2003)**: Another organization would take over to turn ASET's raw technology into a working prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | Japan semiconductor industry]] would contribute partial financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Phase 3 (leading into 2006)**: The [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | Japanese semiconductor industry]] would transform the prototype into a commercialized product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. SALID (Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies), a Japanese R&D consortium with an industry-funded $90 million annual budget, would presumably be in charge along with Nikon and Canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## Technical [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | Challenges]] and Organizational Structure

ASET faced a formidable task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. While [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV lithography]] machine's basic systems shared a philosophical heritage with predecessors, the actual engineering required brand new, substantial work with limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Exposure Tool
ASET chose to focus its limited resources on Optics manufacturing (adding mirror's reflective multi-layers and cleaning them) and Metrology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This meant it could not work on the exposure tool's light source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This task was reassigned to a new industry organization founded in 2001, the Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography System Development Association (EUVA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

EUVA included both academia and industry, with five Japanese equipment companies (Ushio, Canon, Nikon, Komatsu, and Gigaphoton) and four semiconductor manufacturers (Toshiba, NEC, Fujitsu, and Renesas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Academic partners included Himeji Institute of Technology, Kumamoto University, Miyazaki University, and Osaka University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

EUVA proposed two technological approaches to producing [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>:
1.  **Laser-produced plasma (LPP)**: Firing a laser at a material to turn it into plasma, which emits [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. This was the approach that [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] eventually chose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
2.  **Discharge-produced plasma (DPP)**: Creating a cloud of material and firing high-powered sparks between two electrodes to create light-emitting plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. EUVA researched both approaches, with LPP at the Hiro Scott Research Center and DPP at the Gotemba Research Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Photoresist
ASET also handled the [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] photoresist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The major [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | challenge]] was [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] light's high absorbability for traditional resist materials, limiting penetration to about 700 angstroms, far short of the 4,000 angstroms typically needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This required developing a new suite of "thin layer imaging" (TLI) technologies, for which ASET collaborated with the Himeji Institute of Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Mask
ASET needed new subsystems for producing mirror mask blanks (masks without patterns), adding patterns, and cleaning surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Critically, they needed to consistently produce defect-free photo masks, which is immensely difficult due to the incredible tolerances involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. ASET's ambitious intermediate goal was 0.1 to 1 defects per square centimeter, eventually needing to reach 0.003 defects per square centimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. The threshold for a defect on the mask blank was a deviance of just a few nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

Unlike DUV light, which couldn't penetrate deep enough, [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] light itself was needed for inspection (actinic light) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry set up a separate organization for this part of the [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] process: the mask and lithography-related Metrology inspection group within a research consortium called Mirai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### Complicated Setup
By 2005, the [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | Japanese EUV effort]] had expanded beyond the management capacity of a single research institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Four research consortia focused on different parts of the [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>:
*   **ASET**: Handled resist contamination control and multi-layer mirror masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **EUVA**: Handled the exposure tool's light source and some optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Leading Project**: Handled inter-university collaboration surrounding light sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Mirai**: Handled mask defect control detection subsystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

This was a complicated setup compared to the American [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV lithography]] project, which had a single entity, EUV LLC, overseeing early commercialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. EUV LLC operated for six years (1997-2003) before passing the baton to [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. By the program's end, the EUV LLC team had completed their objectives and had a working prototype called the Engineering Test Stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. While the American and Japanese programs shared information, the Americans were clearly in the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

## Nikon and Canon's Efforts

In 2005, Japan's [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | EUV development plan]] aimed for high-volume [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV lithography]] to hit the 45-nanometer process node by 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Some parts of the project met schedules; for instance, Mirai produced an actinic blank inspection tool by 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. However, everything else was waiting on the actual [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] exposure tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This monumental task fell to Canon and Nikon, Japan's leading lithography makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Small Field Prototypes
Both companies aimed to produce small-field prototypes first, which project a minuscule area of light (e.g., 200 micrometers by 600 micrometers) for testing other system parts like the resist and mask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. The Americans, working with Carl Zeiss, delivered their Micro Exposure Tool (MET) in mid-2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. After this, a more ambitious full-field prototype (alpha machine) with a near-production level field size (26mm x 33mm) would be produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Japan's schedule was very optimistic: a pre-alpha by late 2005, an alpha tool by 2006, and a beta tool by 2007, to catch up to [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]]'s Alpha demo tool, which was delivered in August 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

### Canon's Struggles
Canon was the junior partner in [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] efforts, not having mastered 193 nanometer immersion lithography, the most advanced technology before [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. In 2006, Canon and EUVA completed their small-field prototype [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV lithography]] tool, the SFET, installed at an R&D Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. The SFET generated [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] light by firing a 248 nanometer Krypton fluorine laser at a jet of xenon gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Canon believed it could start producing its full-field six-mirror prototype, the VS2, in 2009, with completion scheduled for 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

However, Canon struggled to resolve core [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV problems]] such as raising the [[Advancements in EUV Power Efficiency | EUV power level]], producing defect-free masks, and extending the optic system's lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. During the global financial crisis, Canon's profits shrank over 60%, and with lithography R&D expenses exceeding $600 million a year in 2008, the company likely cut back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Canon never built the VS2 and, as of the transcript, still only sells KrF non-immersion or dry lithography systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

### Nikon's Progress and Setbacks
Nikon was ahead, as the world's only producer of immersion lithography other than [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. From 2001 to 2004, Nikon worked with ASET to produce three iterations of their small-field prototype [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] tool, nicknamed Hina (for [[technical_and_engineering_aspects_of_high_na_euv | high numerical aperture]] tool) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. In April 2006, Nikon felt ready to produce its first full-field exposure tool, a six-mirror system called the EUV-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This alpha device was completed and installed at the SALID R&D Research Center, going live in January 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

This progress was about 1.5 years behind [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]]'s 2006 Alpha demo tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. While the EUV-1 was a substantial achievement (Asia's most advanced lithography machine), it was not commercially competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Its late installation pushed the [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] high-volume ship schedule back from the 45-nanometer process node to the 32-nanometer node, with talk of 28nm and 22nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This presented a major problem: more advanced nodes required more [[Advancements in EUV Power Efficiency | EUV machine power]], but the EUV-1's light source power output was a major drawback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

### Light Source and Contamination [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | Challenges]]
The EUV-1 used a Discharge-Produced Plasma (DPP) contraption by Ushio and its subsidiary Extreme Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. The DPP approach blasts a lightning bolt through xenon vapor to generate [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] photons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. While supposedly more power efficient, physically smaller, and cleaner than LPP, DPP struggled to output enough power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. The EUV-1's light source peaked at 100 Watts, far below the intermediate goal of 110-180 watts and the high-volume production goal of 250 Watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Achieving this would require a system change, swapping xenon for tin, which also presented [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | challenges]] with contamination and power output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] also tried DPP but halted work in 2013, with sufficient power levels only achieved when [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] pioneered its laser double-shot method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. It's likely Nikon would have eventually swapped to LPP, with Gigaphoton as a potential supplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

Tests at SALID with Intel showed the EUV-1 could produce beautiful vertical lines 26-33 nanometers wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. However, the device struggled with contamination control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] light hitting mirror surfaces created carbon contamination, deteriorating reflectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. While pure oxygen and [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] dry cleaning helped with carbon, the team then struggled with mysterious contamination from a silicon carbon compound called cyloxane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>. By 2011, Nikon's researchers were still struggling to overcome these widespread contamination issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

## Decline and End of Japanese EUV Lithography

After the EUV-1's testing, Nikon was to proceed to the EUV2, scheduled for completion in 2011-2012 for 32 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. However, it became clear that [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] was pulling ahead with a substantial lead (18 months to two years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. With the global financial crisis in full force in 2009, Nikon cut R&D budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. While a spokesman denied rumors of halting [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV development]], they clarified the EUV2 would remain an in-house unit, with the EUV3 planned for 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

2010 was another hard year, with market sales for lithography machines falling by half year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Nikon continued its internal research into 2011, targeting the 16 to 11 nanometer process nodes for around 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This was the last significant report available on Nikon's EUV2 or EUV3 progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.

In July 2012, Intel announced it would invest up to $4 billion into [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] in exchange for a stake of up to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. Nikon's shares fell seven percent after the announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. Intel was Nikon's second-biggest customer after Samsung, and while known for sourcing from multiple vendors, the market understood this agreement meant Intel was moving forward with [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. In 2011, Nikon spent a combined $355 million on R&D and capital expenditures for lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Nikon likely decided that without Intel as a cornerstone customer, it was not worth spending hundreds of millions of dollars annually to continue developing [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. Quietly, Nikon's [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] efforts tailed off, and the EUV3 never made its 2012 ship date, leaving [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] as the last man standing in the [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV lithography]] industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

## Legacy and Cost

Japan's [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | EUV efforts]] were not entirely in vain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. Many component efforts turned into viable, technologically advanced businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. For instance, the actinic blank inspection tool from Mirai and its collaboration with Lasertec are successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Japanese companies also hold dominant positions in the [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] photoresist space (JSR, Shin-Etsu, Tokyo Ohka Kogyo are the biggest suppliers), and Tokyo Electron makes the equipment to apply these photoresists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

The story of Japan's [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | EUV failure]] was a close race, not a debacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. Nikon had substantial problems with the EUV-1, but they were not deal-breakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. In the end, what stopped them was economics and competition, not technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. The total cost of Japan's [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | EUV effort]] from 1999 to 2012 is estimated to be between $5 billion and $10 billion, accounting for Nikon and Canon's R&D, consortium budgets, and other investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. By comparison, the original VLSI project that reshaped Japan's semiconductor industry in the late 1970s cost about $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>, highlighting the exponential jump in cost. It is estimated that any government attempting to build an independent [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] machine today would require at least $5 billion to $10 billion, direct guidance from European and American [[The evolution of EUV lithography | EUV]] makers, and about 10 to 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

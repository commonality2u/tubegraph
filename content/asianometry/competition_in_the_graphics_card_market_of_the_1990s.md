In 1995, over 30 different companies were fiercely competing to develop the best graphics chips for personal computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Just six years later, this crowded market would consolidate dramatically, leaving only three major players, with [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] emerging as the clear leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This period saw rapid technological advancements and strategic shifts that redefined the industry.

## Early Graphics Hardware Concepts

The concept of dedicated hardware for complex 3D graphics processing predates [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Atari video game consoles, shipped in the 1970s, already included graphics chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. Commercial video cards, which could be plugged into a main computer, appeared in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. An early example was the IBM Professional Graphics Controller (PGA), released in 1984, which used an onboard Intel 8088 microprocessor to offload video tasks from the CPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. However, its high price of $4,000-$5,000 and exclusivity to IBM PCs prevented its market success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

In the late 1980s, Silicon Graphics Inc (SGI) became the dominant player in the graphics market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. SGI was instrumental in refining the concept of a graphics pipeline, which translates coordinates to 2D pixel space on a screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. In 1992, SGI released OpenGL, a public 3D graphics API (Application Programming Interface) with 120 commands for drawing points, lines, and polygons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. OpenGL became the first widely adopted API in the industry, making its support a critical factor for graphics hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. While SGI hardware dominated the profitable graphics workstation segment, it did not seriously target the consumer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

## The Rise of Consumer Graphics

Consumer interest in graphics exploded with two key developments:
*   **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)**: In 1990, Microsoft released Windows 3.1, which featured a graphical user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Its visual interactivity caught on quickly, selling over 2 million units in its first six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
*   **3D Video Games**: The release of the 3D game *Doom* by id Software in 1993 significantly spurred consumer demand for graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. *Doom* offered a mature, action-packed first-person shooter experience, breaking away from more "childish" games of the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. Its successor, *Quake*, released in 1996, introduced full real-time 3D rendering and online multiplayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. However, many PCs struggled to run *Quake* at its full specifications without additional hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. This led to programmer John Carmack rewriting the game to support OpenGL, resulting in *GLQuake*, which spurred new innovation in the consumer video card space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

## Key Competitors and Their Strategies

### 3dfx and the Voodoo Card

One of the first "killer apps" for graphics chips emerged from a startup called 3dfx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. 3dfx quickly developed a wrapper program to make OpenGL compatible with their proprietary Glide graphics API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. Exploiting a drop in RAM prices, they launched the Voodoo video card, which ran chips designed by 3dfx, manufactured in Taiwan, and sold to various board partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. The Voodoo card was the first consumer video card capable of running *GLQuake* effectively (640x480 at 16-bit color and 30 frames per second) for around $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

Critically, the Voodoo card only offered 3D acceleration, requiring users to have a separate card for 2D acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. Despite this limitation, it sold exceptionally well, and at its peak, 3dfx commanded 80% of the 3D acceleration graphics card market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

### [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s Strategic Pivot

[[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]], founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>, aimed to create microprocessors for high-quality 3D graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. In the mid-1990s, during a Silicon Valley downturn, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] was just one of many graphics chip startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. Early funding rounds raised $2.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

Jensen Huang secured three crucial partnerships:
1.  **Manufacturing**: In 1994, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] partnered with SGS Thompson Microelectronics (now STMicroelectronics) for chip manufacturing, with [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] handling design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.
2.  **Board Sales**: A deal with Diamond Multimedia Systems to integrate [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s chips into their accelerator boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.
3.  **Content/Branding**: A partnership with Sega, allowing [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] to use their brand name for launching its first product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

This led to the release of the NV1 in May 1995, a multimedia PCI card integrating graphics, sound, and Sega gamepad support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. However, the NV1 flopped because it tried to do too much, resulting in compromises, and more importantly, it was not compatible with leading graphics APIs like OpenGL or 3dfx's Glide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.

After the NV1's failure and the collapse of a potential NV2 project with Sega <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] underwent a radical "change everything" strategic pivot, inspired by Samsung's chairman Lee Kun-hee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. They abandoned the multimedia space and bet on three rising trends:
1.  **Microsoft Direct3D**: Despite initial criticism (famously from John Carmack, who called it "horribly broken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>), [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] bet on Microsoft's promise of future improvements and its tight integration with Windows to make Direct3D the dominant 3D graphics API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>. Microsoft had acquired RenderMorphics in 1996 to create Direct3D, part of the larger DirectX bundle, built into Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.
2.  **Vertical Integration of Device Drivers**: Historically, board partners (OEMs) wrote most device drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] decided to take this in-house, writing their own drivers for their hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. This aligned incentives, allowed for more development time, and enabled [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] to aggregate feedback and produce high-performing drivers, a critical competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.
3.  **Outsourced Manufacturing**: [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] ended its partnership with SGS Thompson in 1998 and formed a new one with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>. TSMC advocated for its partners, pledging never to compete with them, and their success was tied to their partners selling more chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>. This allowed [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] to focus entirely on chip design, optimizing for speed and rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.

This new strategy led to the launch of [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s second product, the Riva 128, in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. Designed to accelerate Direct3D, it crucially supported both 3D and 2D graphics, a functionality lacking in 3dfx's Voodoo cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>. Retailing for about $140, the Riva 128 was a success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.

### Intel's Foray

Intel, the "800-pound gorilla" of the industry, predicted in 1996 that 80% of PCs would have 3D graphics by the millennium and that they would dominate the space by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>. This assertion even caused Microsoft to cancel its own line of graphics hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:00">[19:24:00]</a>.

In 1998, Intel released the Intel 740 card with great fanfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:00">[19:29:00]</a>. However, it failed for two main reasons:
1.  **Port Format**: It used the AGP port format, which Intel was trying to popularize, while most of the market stuck with the existing PCI standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:00">[19:36:00]</a>.
2.  **Performance & Cycle Time**: While performing well in speed tests, its real-world performance lagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>. Intel, accustomed to longer 1-2 year CPU development cycles, could not keep pace with the rapid graphics market updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>.

The Intel 740 was quickly discontinued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>. Intel subsequently shifted its focus to integrated graphics processors (IGPs) that used system memory rather than dedicated pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>. Leveraging its CPU monopoly, Intel built massive market share in this space, effectively wiping out the market for low-margin, low-performance discrete graphics cards, as its integrated solutions worked "well enough" for most low-end users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>.

## Market Consolidation

[[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s partnership with TSMC enabled a relentless six-month product cycle, allowing them to deliver a new chip generation every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>. This "brutal march" ground down many competitors in the [[impact_of_technological_advancements_on_graphics_cards | graphics card industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>.

Meanwhile, the market leader, 3dfx, made a critical error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. While their Voodoo 2 (a 3D-only follow-up) sold well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>, 3dfx struggled to develop a proper 3D/2D combined solution, delaying their product lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>. More significantly, in December 1998, 3dfx acquired boardmaker STB for $141 million and announced that their chips would only be available in their own name-branded boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>. This move meant 3dfx was directly competing with its old customers (board partners), many of whom defected to [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>. Lacking manufacturing experience and with STB's Mexican facilities unable to compete with Asian manufacturers, the division became a cash drain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:54:00">[18:54:00]</a>. 3dfx eventually dissolved, selling its assets to [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.

By the early 2000s, the graphics card market had consolidated from over 30 companies to just three: [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] and ATI formed a clear duopoly in the high-end market, with Intel dominating the low-end integrated graphics space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>. ATI was later acquired by AMD in 2006 for $5.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>.

The competitive landscape of the 1990s highlights the importance of strategic vertical integration, as seen in [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s expansion into device drivers (an adjacent field that added value), versus 3dfx's move into manufacturing (which destroyed value and alienated customers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:27:00">[21:27:00]</a>. This era laid the foundation for [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s future as a leading technology company, particularly with its eventual popularization of the General Processing Unit (GPU) and envisioning new applications beyond video game graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>.

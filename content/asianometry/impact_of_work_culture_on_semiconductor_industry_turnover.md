The semiconductor industry faces significant [[challenges_of_working_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenges]] in attracting and retaining talent, largely due to its demanding work culture and the allure of other industries like software development.

### Negative Perceptions of Semiconductor Careers

An article about semiconductor degree programs posted on Hacker News quickly garnered negative comments regarding the career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Common criticisms include:
*   Long hours and frequent on-call duties, with individuals being responsible for tools even when not officially on call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
*   "Abusive and pathological behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   [[career_prospects_in_the_semiconductor_industry_versus_software_development | Subpar long-term career prospects]], often requiring a PhD and post-doctorate experience, followed by 10+ years in an R&D "sweatshop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   Overall described as a "problematic career with long hours, subpar labor practices and low pay" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Despite the political drive in the United States to build new fabs for semiconductor independence and find talent, these negative perceptions actively discourage Americans from joining the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### The Demanding Nature of Semiconductor Manufacturing Jobs

The goal of semiconductor manufacturing is to deliver extremely complicated products at a staggering scale, requiring significant operations discipline and "military-style execution" from companies like Intel, Samsung, and TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Manufacturing jobs differ significantly from design jobs within the industry; design jobs often involve comfortable office work and higher pay, similar to software engineering roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

Specific roles in manufacturing highlight the demanding culture:
*   **Line Technicians and Operators** in Taiwan work 12-hour shifts (7 AM to 7 PM and vice versa) for two days on, two days off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. While requiring only a high school or vocational degree, the internal job progression is limited, and the pay, though better than a 7-Eleven job, comes with high anxiety and pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Process Engineers** inspect and analyze manufacturing processes, needing to optimize variables and test for optimizations when yield rates are low, leading to a "hard" life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Equipment Engineers** monitor and inspect equipment and are responsible when it breaks, requiring a technical degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. In Taiwan, they might even buy charms from temples hoping to make devices more obedient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **R&D Engineers** work in new product development, facing high pressure to innovate, often working 10+ hours a day on experiments and regularly requiring PhDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Turnover Due to Work Culture and Competition

The semiconductor industry, particularly manufacturing, experiences substantial turnover due to demanding work cultures and competition from other sectors:
*   **TSMC's demanding culture** is evident in Taiwan, where despite societal pressure for young people to enter electrical engineering and view TSMC as a prestigious employer, the company faces significant turnover in its technician and engineer ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Cultural clashes** are observed as TSMC expands internationally, such as in Arizona, where American trainees have noted the demanding nature of the work culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Competition from other companies** in Taiwan, including chip design companies like MediaTek and Delta Electronics (which offer comparable salaries) and non-Taiwanese firms like Google (which has actively poached MediaTek's staff), makes it easier for semiconductor talents to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### Comparison to Software Development

A major factor contributing to turnover and recruitment difficulties in semiconductor manufacturing is the intense competition from the software development industry, particularly in the United States and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Attractive perks**: Software development is described as the "single best job category in the world" due to its relative ease of entry, high demand, legendary perks and benefits, and obscenely high salaries (especially with stock compensation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Preference for remote work**: Highly educated individuals often prefer to work remotely from their bedrooms writing code rather than putting on a clean suit and heading into a factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Talent drain**: This preference leads to a significant talent drain, as seen with Berkeley EECS majors overwhelmingly choosing software engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Even within the semiconductor field, many opt for chip design, which shares similarities with software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Limited transferability of skills**: Semiconductor manufacturing workers often develop highly specialized skills that make it difficult to leave the field, potentially leading to underpayment or poor treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This is partly because there are only a few companies doing advanced semiconductor manufacturing, unlike the much larger employer pool for software engineers and IC chip designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Industry Responses to Turnover

Companies are attempting to address the talent and turnover issues:
*   **Wage Increases and Stock Options**: TSMC announced an unusually high 20% employee wage raise in 2020, taking effect in 2022, and has worked to make it easier for employees to purchase company stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. While more pay doesn't solve work environment issues, it certainly helps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   [[industry_strategies_for_attracting_talent_to_semiconductor_manufacturing | Building Talent Pipelines]]: Intel has successfully built its own pipelines of semiconductor technicians, partnering with Arizona community colleges for two-year technical education degree programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. In Malaysia, Intel offered research grants for students to learn semiconductor engineering and contributed senior engineers' time to train them in industry practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This approach aims to create a trained, affordable workforce tailored to the company's specific needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Lack of Early Exposure to Hardware

A contributing factor to [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | waning interest in hardware]] careers among young Americans is the lack of easy access to hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   Unlike software, which is easily accessible via platforms like GitHub, modern hardware is increasingly complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   In the past, people could easily open and understand devices like transistor radios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. While personal computers were more complex, users could still interact directly with the hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   Today's cell phones are so complex that most users can only change the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Users primarily interact with graphical user interfaces (GUI) and user experience (UX) software, sparking interest in those fields for future careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   The integrated chips inside phones are rarely seen or tinkered with by young people, leading to a lack of interest in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

In 1979, the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet Union]] was the world's leading oil producer, pumping 11.5 million barrels daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The 1960s ended with the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet Union]] as the second-largest oil-producing nation globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. However, the most abundant oil and natural gas reserves lay undiscovered beneath Siberia's frozen landscapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This period saw the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet Union]] transform into an energy superpower, a development that ultimately contributed to its dissolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The West Siberian Basin: A Frontier of Energy

The West Siberian Basin, located about 600 miles east of the Ural Mountains, is a vast, flat area covering 3.4 million square kilometers, nearly five times the size of Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Approximately one-third of this region, nearly one million square kilometers, is potentially oil-bearing, an area larger than Texas and Oklahoma combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The area is remote and harsh, characterized by short summers, long and severe winters, high humidity, and temperatures plunging to -27 degrees Celsius, making frost and fog common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Sixty to seventy percent of the region consists of swamps and lakes, which freeze solid for 9 to 10 months of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Consequently, it is sparsely populated, with most early settlers (landless Russian peasants who arrived during the Trans-Siberian Railroad construction in the 1890s) choosing the warmer Siberian south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Despite these challenges, the West Siberian Basin holds some of the world's largest oil and gas deposits, second only to the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. These deposits, dating back to the Triassic and Jurassic periods, include the massive Urengoy gas field and Russia's largest oil field, Samotlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Samotlor partially overlies the Siberian Traps, a site of one of the largest known eruption events in Earth's history 250 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## The Shift to Siberian Development

From 1960 to 1970, the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet Union]]'s total oil production surged from under 3 million barrels per day to 7.1 million barrels (roughly 380 million metric tons per year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Much of this came from the "Second Baku" area in the Volga-Ural province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Although [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet]] geologists predicted significant deposits in the West Siberian Basin as early as the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, the government initially hesitated to develop these fields, questioning their extent and the cost of extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. A high-ranking Communist Party member famously dismissed claims of vast reserves as "fruit of a sick provincial imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Circumstances forced a change in perspective. By the mid to late 1960s, the Volga-Ural oil fields began to decline faster than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. From 1971 to 1975, the decline in European oil fields was 261 million tons, significantly more than the planned 150 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This decline posed a major problem because the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet]] oil industry had two critical functions:
*   It was the country's largest source of foreign currency, providing over 50% for purchasing goods like wheat from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   The [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviets]] had long-term oil export obligations to the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Eastern Bloc]] countries, all of whom, except Romania, relied on [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet]] energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. These deliveries were made via extensive pipelines like Druzhba ("Friendship") and Bratstvo ("Brotherhood") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

In January 1968, [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet]] Premier Alexei Kosygin visited the Tyumen region of West Siberia, highlighting its potential for economic advancement and the need for infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. By 1971, Brezhnev began urgently pushing for West Siberian development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. A new ministry was founded to build oil infrastructure, led by Boris Shcherbina, who later gained renown for managing the Chernobyl crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Overcoming Development Challenges

West Siberia presented a serious development challenge due to its lack of population, unlike Baku or the Volga-Urals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Developing the area meant creating entire towns from nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, requiring hundreds of thousands of geologists, builders, and work crews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Worker settlements were difficult to build in harsh conditions, and since agriculture was impossible, all food had to be transported by rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This resulted in a cost of living 1.5 to 1.7 times higher than in European parts of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

Unlike the Stalinist era, workers now had freedom of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. To attract people to this "wasteland," salaries in West Siberia were 2.2 to 2.5 times higher than elsewhere, and promotions were easier to obtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The Party ran media campaigns to recruit specialists, primarily young workers under 35, who signed up for short periods to earn significant money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Rapid Production Growth and Environmental Impact

West Siberia soon began to yield its riches:
*   **1965**: 5.6 million tons of oil and 1.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **1970**: Oil production reached 31 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **1975**: Oil production reached 141 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **1977**: Production soared to 211 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

By 1973, 113 oil fields had been discovered, including supergiant fields with 5 billion tons of reserves between 1965 and 1973, such as Samotlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

The [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviets]] built long gas pipelines to transport products to European buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. In the latter half of the 1970s, they laid 1,400 kilometers of pipeline, moved 130 million cubic meters of soil, and tore up 27.2 million square meters of agricultural land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Pipeline construction rates were three to five times faster than in the West, resulting in costs per kilometer a third of Western averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

While an economic success, this came at a significant [[economic_and_environmental_impacts_of_soviet_oil_production | environmental cost]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviets]] disregarded ecology, leading to wastewater pollution, torn-up taiga, and hundreds of abandoned drilled wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. The economic plan had to be fulfilled "no matter what" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, and West Siberian operations were constantly pushed for more oil despite sustainability warnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## International Energy Trade and Political Influence

West Siberia's oil dominance found customers at an opportune time. International conflicts in the 1950s and 60s showed Europe that it could not solely rely on Arab oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. [[Soviet energy trade relationships with Eastern Bloc and Western Europe | Soviet oil]] offered a compelling diversification option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

*   **Western Europe**: Austria signed a deal in 1968, followed by Italy (1969), West Germany (1970), and France (1972) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. West Germany was a particularly notable agreement. Despite domestic controversy due to political issues like Berlin's division and German reunification, West Germany's rising domestic gas demand (from 8 billion cubic meters in 1969 to an estimated 26 billion in 1975) made [[Soviet energy trade relationships with Eastern Bloc and Western Europe | Soviet gas]] attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. The German Ministry of Economics believed a [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet]] share under 20% would be acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The year after West Germany began accepting [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet gas]], the Four Power Agreement of 1971 was signed, leading to *de facto* recognition between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. These agreements, part of *détente*, led to further economic partnerships throughout the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

*   **United States**: In 1972, the U.S. and [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet Union]] agreed on a potential "North Star" energy deal, envisioning liquefied [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet natural gas]] shipped from the Barents Sea to the American West Coast from 1980 to 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This deal, if it had included Japan, would have brought much-needed LNG revenues and Western technologies to the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. However, Congress eventually nixed it in 1974 due to denials of most-favored-nation status and credit guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

The oil crises of the 1970s, including the Iranian Revolution, further accelerated these economic exchanges between the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviets]] and Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Many of these energy relationships persist today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Oil as the Glue for the Eastern Bloc

[[Postwar Soviet oil expansion and political influence | Soviet oil]] and energy exports were a crucial factor holding the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Eastern Bloc]] together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Shortly after World War II, the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet Union]] established the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) for [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Eastern Bloc]] states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Within CMEA, the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviets]] provided raw goods, while satellites sent back manufactured goods, machinery, and agricultural produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

Oil deliveries were made on "brotherly terms," significantly below Western market prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet Union]] could not pass on increased extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. By the mid-1960s, it was known that these inter-bloc agreements were unfavorable to the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. As the lucrative [[Soviet energy trade relationships with Eastern Bloc and Western Europe | West European energy export industry]] developed in the 1970s, the opportunity costs of these "friendship" oil trade agreements became increasingly clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Yet, states like East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary had grown dependent on these brotherly oil imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, and failing to meet these obligations would have had severe political and socio-economic repercussions, especially as the satellites became more indebted to Western creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

## Stagnation and Decline of the Energy Superpower

Contrary to expectations of infinite growth, West Siberia's oil production rapidly stagnated and declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. From 1975 onwards, its growth rates dropped sharply, from 23.8% in 1976 to 7% in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This abrupt stagnation had massive ripple effects:
*   The [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet Union]]'s overall oil production growth rate, which averaged 9.1% annually in the 1960s, fell to just 6.2% between 1971 and 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   By 1981, the total oil growth rate plummeted to under one percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   In 1984, [[Soviet industrial growth and technological lag | Soviet]] oil output entered negative growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

Without access to more advanced oil drills and pumps from the West, Brezhnev and the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviets]] resorted to doubling exploratory drilling, from 13 million meters drilled in 1977 to over 26 million in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Sixteen million of this new drilling occurred in West Siberia, forcing teams to travel further, drill deeper, and work in more complicated formations, doubling per-meter drill costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

The [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet energy industry]], and consequently the entire [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet economy]], found itself investing more to produce less, caught in a cycle of "throwing good money after bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. The [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet economy]] became more energy-intensive; in 1970, it required 0.71 tons of coal energy equivalent per thousand dollars of economic income, rising to 0.83 by 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

Unlike Western economies where car drivers and households accounted for significant oil consumption (allowing for flexibility in adjustment during oil shocks), only 15% of [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet]] oil consumption came from households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Nearly half was from heavy industry, which was less flexible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. A push to switch from oil to natural gas did yield some savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Due to considerable oil export obligations, the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviets]] had little room to cut domestic consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

By the late 1980s, the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet Union]] remained the world's largest oil producer and third-biggest coal producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Yet, its economy stagnated, consumed by its unproductive energy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Coherence within the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Eastern Bloc]] faded as the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviets]] prioritized their own needs, leading satellite states to turn to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

## The 1986 Oil Price Collapse and its Aftermath

In 1986, oil prices collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Rising output from Alaska, the British North Sea, and OPEC (with Saudi Arabia drastically raising quotas in September 1985) contributed to an oil glut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Oil prices plummeted from $27 a barrel to below $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

This collapse turned all the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet]] investment in oil into a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Foreign currency earnings from oil and gas sales evaporated, paving the way for the [[collapse_of_the_soviet_union_linked_to_oil_and_gas_industry_challenges | debt crisis that dissolved the Soviet Union]] a few years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

The [[rise and decline of soviet economic strategies | Soviet Union]] might have been better off in the long run had it never exploited West Siberian oil and gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. High energy revenues "papered over" the need for crucial reforms in the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. There was no need to improve domestic agriculture if oil money paid for imports, nor to make computers if they could be bought from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

Energy both sustained and ultimately undermined the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. It was the pillar that kept the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet]] house standing longer than it should have, but also the crutch that weakened the country's ability to stand independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. The legacy of the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet]] energy superpower and its influence on European and Asian politics endures to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

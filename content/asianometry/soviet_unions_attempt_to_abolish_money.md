In its early years, the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union]] embarked on a radical experiment to create a society without money, which ultimately proved to be a disaster [00:00:02]. Despite the country being devastated by years of [[economic_impact_of_war_and_revolution_on_the_soviet_union | war and revolution]], the Bolsheviks aimed to immediately establish their ideal socialist utopia: a moneyless society [00:00:07]. Paradoxically, this vision involved the printing of hundreds of billions of rubles [00:00:18].

The [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union]] represents one of the most intriguing economic and social experiments in world history [00:00:31].

## Theoretical Basis: Marx's View on Money

Classical economists viewed money as a neutral facilitator for buying and selling goods [00:02:00]. Karl Marx, while acknowledging this function, profoundly disagreed with the downplaying of money's societal role [00:02:07].

Marx's key arguments against money included:
*   **Economic Instability**: Money contributed to cyclical booms of over and under production within the capitalist economy [00:02:13]. Capitalists convert money (M) into commodities (C) and then resell them for more money (M Prime) (M -> C -> M Prime) [00:02:24]. If M Prime is not greater than M, capitalists will hoard money, leading to periodic overproduction booms and crises [00:02:46].
*   **Exploitation and Alienation**: Marx believed money was the mechanism by which the bourgeoisie class "parasitically sucked out the blood of the working class" [00:03:00]. Workers' wages were not as valuable as the outputs of their labor, which generated wealth for capitalists [00:03:07]. This process alienated workers from their valuable outputs [00:03:21].

Marx envisioned that money would be unnecessary in a centrally planned socialist society [00:03:27]. Consequently, the idea of eliminating money from the entire economy was deeply ingrained and widespread among the Bolsheviks [00:03:33].

## Pre-Bolshevik Economic Landscape (1914-1917)

Before the Bolshevik takeover, Russia's economy was already facing severe challenges, largely due to World War I.
*   **Abandonment of Gold Standard**: Russia, like other European governments, abandoned the gold standard in June 1914, four days after entering the war [00:03:44].
*   **Deficit Spending**: The Imperial government ran a 39% deficit in the first year of the war, escalating to 75% in the subsequent two years [00:03:57].
*   **Economic Decline**: The war led to large government budget overruns, foreign borrowing, physical destruction, economic output collapses, and high inflation [00:04:02].
    *   Between 1913 and 1917, the number of industrial workers declined by 16.4% [00:04:13].
    *   Total industrial output fell by 22.7% [00:04:21].
*   **Inflationary Crisis**: By early 1917, the amount of paper rubles in circulation had increased to 9 billion from 1.6 billion in July 1914, a 5.5 times increase [00:04:26]. This was significantly higher than the 100-200% increase seen in France and Germany [00:04:42].
*   **Government Deficit**: In 1917, Russia's government deficit reached 82% of its budget, with 73% of that deficit funded by the printing press [00:04:47].

## Early Bolshevik Policies (War Communism)

The Bolsheviks inherited an economy already in [[hyperinflation_and_economic_challenges_during_the_soviet_war_communism | inflationary crisis]] [00:04:57]. Furthermore, the new revolutionary government initially lacked access to much of the Empire's most productive land [00:05:03]. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918 resulted in Russia losing a third of its population, nearly a third of its agricultural land, and over half of its industry [00:05:10]. Key resources like the oil wells of Baku and the Caucasus (97% of Russia's total oil output) were inaccessible until late 1919 [00:05:23]. Ukraine, which provided 78% of Russia's coal, 74% of its iron ore, and 80% of its grain, was also largely outside Bolshevik control until 1920 due to [[economic_impact_of_war_and_revolution_on_the_soviet_union | World War One]] and the Russian Civil War [00:05:34].

Despite the "sorry state" of the Russian economy and its largely agricultural, semi-industrialized nature [00:05:57], the Bolsheviks proceeded with their socialist transformation. Lenin outlined steps for this new economy in his pamphlet "The Immediate Tasks of Soviet Rule," which involved establishing a dictatorship of the proletariat and centralizing all economic activities into a single national plan [00:06:12].

### [[nationalization_of_banks_and_industries_in_early_soviet_russia | Nationalization of Banks]]

Marx believed banking was central to capitalism [00:06:44], and The Communist Manifesto listed a single central bank as the first step towards centralizing the means of production [00:06:51]. Russia's financial system was highly centralized, with 12 banks holding 80% of the country's capital, making [[nationalization_of_banks_and_industries_in_early_soviet_russia | bank nationalization]] relatively straightforward [00:07:00].

*   On November 20, 1917, the People's Commissar of Finance seized the Russian State Bank (Goss Bank) [00:07:18].
*   Private banks initially refused orders to fund worker-controlled factories [00:07:27].
*   In December 1917, Bolshevik troops occupied the largest banks, transferring their capital to Goss Bank [00:07:34].
*   By the end of 1918, all banks were liquidated and merged into Goss Bank, which ceased lending and merely kept accounts of transactions [00:07:56].
*   Dividends were abolished, withdrawals restricted, and all foreign debts canceled [00:07:48].

This nationalization "pinched off the flow of credit," leading to the closure of 405 enterprises and 205,000 workers in the first quarter of 1918 due to a lack of credit [00:08:06].

### [[nationalization_of_banks_and_industries_in_early_soviet_russia | Nationalization of Industry]]

In June 1918, the Council of People's Commissars announced the [[nationalization_of_banks_and_industries_in_early_soviet_russia | nationalization of industry]] [00:08:44]. Lenin viewed this as "pulling out and cutting the wires through which the capitalists controlled the economy" [00:08:56].

*   Throughout late 1918 and early 1919, the government nationalized railways, shipping, mining, and other sectors [00:09:02].
*   This process was chaotic, with less than 14% of nationalizations handled by the central government; the majority were by local organizations and trade unions [00:09:17].
*   The chaotic nationalization led to the ejection of many skilled workers and business owners, leaving new owners with insufficient knowledge to run the industries [00:09:30].

### Funding the Revolution and War

While moving towards a moneyless society, the Bolsheviks simultaneously printed vast amounts of money to fund their budgets [00:08:35]. The Russian Civil War (summer 1918 to end of 1919) further strained the treasury [00:09:44]. The government focused all efforts on supplying the Red Army, utilizing every available laborer and resource for the war [00:10:02].

*   **Financial Constraints**: No one would lend money to the new Bolshevik government, especially after it repudiated all foreign debts and nationalized assets in 1918 [00:10:25].
*   **Taxation Issues**: In 1918, income taxes provided only 7.3% of total budget spending [00:10:39]. The Bolsheviks raised indirect taxes and imposed an extraordinary income tax, breaking earlier promises [00:10:47].
*   **Hyperinflation**: The only way to fill budget gaps was to print more money [00:10:58].
    *   By the end of 1918, inflation reached 598%, with over 60 billion rubles in circulation [00:11:02].
    *   However, the value of these rubles, using 1913 values, had fallen to a tenth of their 1917 value (from 2.4 billion to 222 million) [00:11:10].

### Food Crisis and Requisitioning

The party's primary effort was to keep the country supplied with food [00:11:22].
*   In January 1918, Lenin urgently demanded grain shipments to save Petersburg [00:11:28].
*   The Tsarist government had introduced a grain monopoly during World War I, prohibiting grain trading and requiring farmers to deliver surpluses to the state at fixed prices [00:11:46]. The Provisional Government and later the Bolsheviks continued this policy [00:12:00].
*   The crashing ruble meant wages were worthless to peasants, who refused to sell goods at official state prices [00:12:06].
*   The government, misdiagnosing the problem as distribution rather than production, responded by "requisitioning" food [00:12:14]. This further disincentivized peasants from producing surpluses [00:12:24].
*   In May 1918, the Bolsheviks declared a "food dictatorship," reaffirming the grain monopoly and permitting armed force to seize food from peasants [00:12:31].

### Escalating Hyperinflation

High inflation quickly became [[hyperinflation_and_economic_challenges_during_the_soviet_war_communism | hyperinflation]].
*   In May 1919, the People's Bank announced it would print as much money as possible [00:12:47].
*   Inflation doubled from 598% to 1,376% in 1919 [00:12:56].
*   The ruble's value crashed so rapidly that the government had to publish budgets retroactively, making planning impossible [00:13:04].
*   In the second half of 1919, money printing costs accounted for 45-60% of the mint's total budget, and even then, ministries received less than their requests, including the war Ministry (less than 40%) [00:13:13].

Amazingly, the Bolsheviks argued that this [[hyperinflation_and_economic_challenges_during_the_soviet_war_communism | hyperinflation]] was a sign of their socialist transformation succeeding [00:13:29]. Their stated goal was to devalue money to nothing, thereby annihilating the power of the wealthy, transitioning to a system of state distribution, and creating a moneyless world [00:13:35]. As "The ABC of Communism" stated, the extensive issue of paper money would promote the "gradual disappearance of money" [00:13:47]. However, this unlimited printing also indicated the Bolsheviks' continued reliance on the old capitalist system to fuel their industrial and war machines [00:13:57].

## Intensification of War Communism Policies (Post-Civil War)

By April 1920, the Red Army had largely won the Civil War, and defense spending began to decrease [00:14:12]. This military success emboldened the Bolsheviks to intensify their "economic war" policies [00:14:18].
*   **Demonetization**: Policies of demonetizing and nationalizing the economy, and requisitioning food, were intensified [00:14:26].
*   **State Control**: The state sought to take over the entire supply and distribution system, making public services like transportation and telegraph use free [00:14:35].
*   In December 1920, Lenin signed decrees making medicines, food, consumer goods, fuel, and postage free [00:14:45].
*   **Banishment of Private Trade**: The government intensified efforts to demonetize the economy, aiming to banish private trade and money for good [00:14:54]. The government would control all inputs and distribute all outputs [00:15:00].
*   **Payment in Kind**: Taxes and wages were increasingly paid in physical goods rather than cash [00:15:03]. By 1921, 93% of all wages were paid this way [00:15:09].
*   **Alternative Accounting Units**: With the ruble's collapsing value, suggestions for new accounting units emerged, such as physical properties, salt, cooperative funds, or the "tread" (a unit of labor based on a day of simple labor at normal intensity) [00:15:16]. These suggestions only confused people and proved impractical [00:15:39].
*   **Continued Hyperinflation**: In the end, only the hyper-inflating ruble remained [00:15:50].
    *   In 1921, the government issued 16.3 trillion new rubles, yet still ran a deficit of 21.9 trillion rubles [00:15:53].
    *   In 1922, issuance swelled to 1.97 quadrillion new rubles [00:16:09].

## Consequences and Reversal

By 1921, the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet government]] recognized that War Communism had gone "too far" [00:16:16].
*   **Economic Collapse**: The Russian economy was in ruins [00:16:20]. The state was unprepared to centralize control of every item [00:16:22].
*   **Flourishing Black Markets**: The belief that economic market laws would cease to apply once the state took over distribution was incorrect; illegal markets flourished, supplying most people's food [00:16:30].
*   **Production Stagnation**: Production of items like steel, sugar, and bricks practically ceased [00:16:40]. Overall industrial production fell to a third of pre-war (1913) levels [00:16:45].
*   **Lack of Incentive**: Without money, there was a total lack of incentive to work [00:16:51]. Railroad worker desertion rates hit 40% [00:16:55]. A worker in 1920 produced only 45% of their pre-war output [00:16:57].
*   **Humanitarian Crisis**: [[hyperinflation_and_economic_challenges_during_the_soviet_war_communism | Hyperinflation]] devastated the lives of the Russian people [00:17:04]. Daily caloric intake in 1919 fell by 30% from the 1910s average [00:17:07].
*   **Famine and Revolt**: A famine broke out in 1921-1922, leading to 5 million deaths, as food requisitioning had left peasants with no reserves [00:17:19]. Peasant revolts, including the Kronstadt Rebellion in 1921, shook Lenin's confidence in the current direction [00:17:31].

### New Economic Policy (NEP)

Lenin realized that market activity had to return [00:17:44]. In March 1921, the New Economic Policy (NEP) was implemented to reverse the decline, grow output, and stabilize the currency [00:17:48].

*   By 1923, after issuing 176.5 quintillion new rubles [00:17:59], the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet government]] completely reversed course [00:18:06].
*   They issued a gold-backed currency, made the Central Bank independent, and rebalanced the budget [00:18:07].
*   Rebellions subsided, and output began to recover [00:18:12].

Reflecting on this period, Lenin admitted, "Life has shown how wrong we were" in believing that enthusiasm could directly accomplish economic tasks [00:18:22]. He attributed the mistakes of the War Communism years to the interruptions from the Civil War [00:18:42]. However, the state's clear intention during this period was to tear the country away from capitalism, create a monopoly on trade, and eradicate money [00:18:49]. Their plans, instead, led to chaos, violence, and a "total crisis level collapse in production" [00:19:00].

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

In its early years, the [[economic_challenges_of_early_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] attempted to create a society without money, which proved to be a disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Despite the country being ravaged by war and revolution, the [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Bolsheviks]] immediately sought to establish their ideal socialist utopia: a moneyless society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This endeavor strangely involved the printing of hundreds of billions of rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This period represents the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union's]] devastating first engagement with Communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

The [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] was a unique economic and social experiment in world history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Marxist Theory on Money

Classical economists viewed money as a neutral facilitator of goods exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Karl Marx, however, acknowledged this but criticized how economists downplayed money's societal role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Marx identified two primary issues with money:
1.  **Economic Cycles** He believed money contributed to cyclical booms of over and underproduction in capitalist economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Capitalists only convert money (M) to commodity (C) and back to more money (M') if M' is greater than M, leading to hoarding if not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This hoarding then periodically leads to simultaneous production, causing overproduction booms and crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
2.  **Exploitation and Alienation** Marx viewed money as the tool by which the bourgeoisie extracted wealth from the working class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Workers' wages were not as valuable as the outputs of their labor, which generated wealth for capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Money, seemingly neutral, facilitated overproduction crises and alienated workers from their valuable outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

Marx argued that money would be unnecessary in a socialist, [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | centrally planned Society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Bolsheviks]] widely embraced the idea of eliminating money from the economy as a fundamental aspect of their vision for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Economic Context Before Bolshevik Rule

World War I led many European governments, including Imperial Russia, to abandon the gold standard and print money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Russia left the gold standard in June 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The government ran a 39% deficit in the first year of the war and 75% in the subsequent two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

The war resulted in:
*   Large government budget overruns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>
*   Foreign borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>
*   Physical destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>
*   Collapse in economic output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
*   High rates of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>

Between 1913 and 1917, Russia's industrial workforce declined by 16.4%, and total industrial output by 22.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. By the start of 1917, the paper rubles in circulation increased to 9 billion from 1.6 billion in July 1914, a 5.5-fold increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The Russian government's deficit in 1917 was 82% of its budget, with 73% funded by the printing press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Thus, the [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Bolsheviks]] inherited an economy already grappling with an [[hyperinflation_and_economic_crisis_in_soviet_russia | inflationary crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Additionally, much of the Empire's productive land became inaccessible after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Russia lost a third of its population, nearly a third of its agricultural land, and over half of its industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The [[soviet_union_early_oil_industry_development | oil wells of Baku and the Caucasus]], accounting for 97% of Russia's oil output, were inaccessible until late 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Ukraine, which provided 78% of Russia's coal, 74% of its iron ore, and 80% of its grain, was not reliably under Bolshevik control until 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Early Bolshevik Policies: War Communism

Despite the dire state of the [[economic_challenges_of_early_soviet_union | Russian economy]], which was largely agricultural and semi-industrialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, the newly installed [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Bolsheviks]] proceeded with their plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Lenin outlined the steps in "The Immediate Tasks of Soviet Rule," aiming for a dictatorship of the proletariat and centralization of all economic activities under a single national plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Nationalization of Banks
Marx believed banking was central to capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The Communist Manifesto listed establishing a single central bank as the first step towards centralizing the means of production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Russia's financial system was already centralized, with 12 banks holding 80% of the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

On November 20, 1917, the People's Commissar of Finance seized the Russian State Bank (Goss Bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Private banks were ordered to fund worker-controlled factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Upon their refusal, troops occupied the largest banks in December 1917, transferring their capital to Goss Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. By the end of 1918, all banks were liquidated and merged into Goss Bank, which would no longer lend money but merely record transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This nationalization cut off credit, leading to 405 enterprises closing in the first quarter of 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Nationalization of Industry
In June 1918, the Council of People's Commissars announced the [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | nationalization]] of industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This was seen as "pulling out and cutting the wires through which the capitalists controlled the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Railways, shipping, mining, and other sectors were nationalized throughout late 1918 and early 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

The nationalization drive was chaotic, with less than 14% handled by the central government; the majority was done by local organizations and trade unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This led to the ejection of skilled workers and business owners, leaving new owners unprepared to run the industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Funding the Revolution and War
The [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Bolsheviks]] were simultaneously fighting the Russian Civil War (summer 1918 to end of 1919), dedicating all efforts to supplying the Red Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The war and nationalization strained the treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Since no one would lend to the new government after it repudiated foreign debts and nationalized assets in 1918, the only way to fund expenses was through the [[hyperinflation_and_economic_crisis_in_soviet_russia | money printing press]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

Income taxes provided only 7.3% of total budget spending in 1918, forcing the [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Bolsheviks]] to raise indirect taxes and introduce an extraordinary income tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. By the end of 1918, [[hyperinflation_and_economic_crisis_in_soviet_russia | inflation]] reached 598%, with over 60 billion rubles in circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The actual value of these rubles, measured against 1913 values, had fallen by a tenth from 1917 to 222 million (from 2.4 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Food Requisitioning
Food shortages were an early problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. The Tsarist government had introduced a grain monopoly during WWI, prohibiting private grain trading and forcing farmers to deliver surpluses to the state at fixed prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. The Provisional Government continued it, and the [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Bolsheviks]] reaffirmed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

However, the crashing ruble meant wages no longer incentivized peasants, who refused to sell goods at official state prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. The government, perceiving the issue as distribution rather than production, responded by "requisitioning" food, which further disincentivized peasants from producing surpluses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. In May 1918, the [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Bolsheviks]] announced a "food dictatorship," permitting armed force to take food from peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

## Hyperinflation and Ideological Justification

[[hyperinflation_and_economic_crisis_in_soviet_russia | Hyperinflation]] soon followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. In May 1919, the People's Bank announced it would print unlimited money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. Inflation doubled from 598% to 1,376% in 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. The ruble's value crashed so fast that the government had to publish budgets retroactively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. By late 1919, money printing costs consumed 45-60% of the mint's budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

Amazingly, the [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Bolsheviks]] argued that this [[hyperinflation_and_economic_crisis_in_soviet_russia | hyperinflation]] was a sign of their socialist transformation succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Their goal in printing unlimited paper money was to devalue it to nothing, thereby annihilating the power of the wealthy, transitioning to state distribution, and ultimately creating a moneyless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. "The ABC of Communism" stated that the extensive issue of paper money would promote money's gradual disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. However, it could also be argued that the unlimited printing indicated their continued reliance on the old capitalist system to fuel their industrial and war efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## Post-Civil War Intensification and Collapse

By April 1920, the Red Army had largely won the Civil War, leading to a winding down of defense spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. This battlefield success gave the [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Bolsheviks]] confidence to intensify policies of demonetizing and nationalizing the economy and requisitioning food from peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

The state aimed to control the entire supply and distribution system, making public services like transportation and telegraph use free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. In December 1920, Lenin signed decrees making medicines, food, consumer goods, fuel, and postage free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Private trade was to be abolished, with the government controlling all inputs and outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Taxes and wages were to be paid in kind (physical goods), with 93% of wages paid this way by 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

Various alternative accounting units were suggested to replace money, such as physical properties, salt, cooperative funds, or a "tread" (a unit of labor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. However, these only caused confusion in valuing goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. The [[economic_challenges_of_early_soviet_union | hyper-inflating ruble]] remained the only unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. In 1921, the government issued 16.3 trillion new rubles, yet still ran a deficit of 21.9 trillion rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. By 1922, issuance swelled to 1.97 quadrillion new rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

### Economic Ruin
By 1921, the [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | Soviet government]] realized that [[rise_and_decline_of_soviet_economic_strategies | War Communism]] had gone too far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. The [[soviet_economic_stagnation_and_need_for_reform | Russian economy fell into ruins]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. The state was unprepared to centralize control of all items, and the belief that market laws no longer applied was incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Illegal markets flourished, providing most people's food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Production of steel, sugar, and bricks practically ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Overall industrial production fell to a third of pre-war levels (1913) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

The absence of money led to a total lack of incentive for people to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Worker desertion rates on railways hit 40%, and in 1920, a worker produced only 45% of their pre-war output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. [[hyperinflation_and_economic_crisis_in_soviet_russia | Hyperinflation]] ruined the lives of Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. Daily caloric intake in 1919 fell by 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. A famine broke out in 1921-1922, killing 5 million people, as food requisitioning left them with no reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

## Shift to New Economic Policy (NEP)

Despite the end of the Russian Civil War, unrest continued, with peasant revolts like the Kronstadt rebellion in 1921 shaking Lenin's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. Lenin realized that market activity needed to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. In March 1921, the [[soviet_economic_stagnation_and_need_for_reform | New Economic Policy]] (NEP) was implemented to reverse the decline, grow output, and stabilize the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

By 1923, the [[soviet_economic_stagnation_and_need_for_reform | Soviet government fully reversed course]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. They issued a gold-backed currency, made the Central Bank independent, and rebalanced the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. Rebellions subsided, and output began to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

Lenin reflected on the period, stating, "Life has shown how wrong we were" in attempting to apply war enthusiasm directly to economic tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. He considered the NEP a real way forward, attributing the mistakes of the [[rise_and_decline_of_soviet_economic_strategies | War Communism]] years to the Civil War's interruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

## Conclusion

The state's intention during the [[rise_and_decline_of_soviet_economic_strategies | War Communism]] years was to break away from capitalism, create a trade monopoly, and eradicate money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. However, these plans instead led to chaos, violence, and a complete collapse in production, with the notable exception of rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

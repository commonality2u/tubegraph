[[euv_light_source_development_and_laserproduced_plasma | Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography]] has become a commercial reality, with ASML machines using [[euv_light_source_development_and_laserproduced_plasma | EUV light]] to create minuscule patterns on wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. A critical component of these machines is the [[euv_light_source_development_and_laserproduced_plasma | EUV light source]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This system relies on lasers firing pulses at tin droplets to generate the powerful 13.5 nanometer wavelength light necessary for modern microprocessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Challenges for Next-Generation EUV Light Sources

For the next generation of [[euv_light_source_development_and_laserproduced_plasma | EUV light sources]], two primary requirements were identified:
1.  **High Conversion Efficiency**: The source must generate sufficient [[euv_light_source_development_and_laserproduced_plasma | EUV light]] at the precise 13.5 nanometer wavelength, emitted in the correct direction towards the collector optics, and do so efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
2.  **Debris Mitigation**: Firing lasers at targets creates debris that can degrade the critical optic system, necessitating a solution to manage this debris to meet cost requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

These challenges proved incredibly difficult to overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Evolution of Target Materials

Early experiments in [[euv_light_source_development_and_laserproduced_plasma | laser produced plasma]] (LPP) involved pointing lasers at targets to create plasma that would emit UV light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Initially, the most promising targets were rare xenon gas (in gaseous or ice form) or lithium, using YAG lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Scientists could suppress xenon ice particles, but high-energy ions still degraded the optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

Tin plasma was recognized for its ability to emit a significant amount of UV light at the required wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. However, early attempts with *tin plates* resulted in terrible conversion efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Furthermore, using tin as an [[euv_light_source_development_and_laserproduced_plasma | EUV light source]] notoriously generated a lot of tin debris; a 1.2 nanometer thick tin layer could cause a 20% decline in collector efficiency and a 10% decline in total tool output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Consequently, tin did not initially seem very promising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Despite initial reservations, companies began experimenting with firing lasers at *tin droplets* instead of tin plates, yielding good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. In 2002, industry leaders debated the future of xenon, realizing its conversion efficiency was too low (less than 1%) and could not generate more than several tens of watts of [[euv_light_source_development_and_laserproduced_plasma | EUV light]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. While the tin option presented a "debris nightmare," it had no fundamental physics roadblock that engineering couldn't overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This led to the industry's decision to pursue tin plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## Optimizing Tin Droplet Interaction for Efficiency

The low conversion efficiency of tin plates stemmed from a low spectral efficiency, meaning a small ratio of 13.5 nanometer light relative to the energy input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Plasma generated from a tin plate was too opaque, blocking the desired 13.5 nanometer light from reaching the mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

To resolve this, a new target shape was proposed: a concave rather than flat surface, designed to increase spectral efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Firing a laser onto this shape creates 13.5 nanometer light with significantly more intensity, improving overall spectral and conversion efficiency to an acceptable level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

Additionally, large tin plates or wires produced excessive debris and fast ions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. The solution was to make the target as small as possible, hence the adoption of droplets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

The challenge became how to achieve the desired small, concave shape. The "wicked" solution involved two lasers hitting a falling tin droplet twice, 100,000 times per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>:

1.  **Pre-pulse**: A low-energy laser pulse hits the tin droplet, creating strong pressure waves that reshape it from a sphere into a concave sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Precise targeting is crucial to avoid tilting the sheet or reflecting the subsequent shot back at the laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
2.  **Main Pulse**: A more powerful blast from an amplified carbon dioxide laser (10 micrometer wavelength) remakes the droplet into an acorn shape and vaporizes it, creating dense plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This plasma then emits the 13.5 nanometer [[euv_light_source_development_and_laserproduced_plasma | EUV light]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

The introduction of the pre-pulse in 2016, combined with more powerful CO2 lasers, allowed ASML and Kymer (an ASML subsidiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>) to drastically scale up [[euv_light_source_development_and_laserproduced_plasma | EUV light source]] power levels from 10 watts to over 200 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## The Machine in Action

The [[euv_light_source_development_and_laserproduced_plasma | EUV light source]] machine's main components include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>:
*   A high-powered CO2 laser (master oscillator and power amplifier, collectively MOPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This laser is large and often installed under the clean room floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   A beam transport system for focusing and positioning the laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   A vacuum vessel, filled with low-pressure hydrogen gas, which houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>:
    *   The droplet generator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
    *   Metrology modules for performance monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
    *   The [[Innovations in Optical Systems for High NA EUV | EUV collector mirror]], which has a hole in the middle for the laser to fire through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

The droplet generator shoots 30 micrometer wide tin droplets into the vessel at a rate of 50 kilohertz (50,000 cycles per second) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. These droplets are shot at a high speed of 80 meters per second (288 km/h) to ensure a large separation (1.6 millimeters) between them, preventing interference from plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. The process literally involves hitting 50,000 "bullets" per second with a laser, twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

This sophisticated setup yields a final conversion efficiency of six percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This is a massive improvement from the less than one percent seen with early YAG lasers and xenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. This breakthrough allowed ASML's [[High Numerical Aperture EUV Machines | EUV machines]] to reach the stable 250 watt power level needed to achieve 125 wafers per hour, meeting client demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. There is even a pathway to 450 watts in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

## Debris Mitigation with Hydrogen Gas

To ensure the collector optics could withstand over 100 billion pulses (or 30,000 hours) over their lifetime, researchers needed to protect them from tin debris particles, high-energy ions, and neutrals from the plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Carl Zeiss and ASML decided to pump hydrogen into the vacuum chamber as a buffer gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This hydrogen gas cools the plasma, blocks a percentage of tin ions, and etches layers of tin from the mirror surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

The development of the [[euv_light_source_development_and_laserproduced_plasma | EUV laser]] was a triumph of deep scientific understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Unlike previous lithography laser developments that relied on trial and error with existing technologies, [[Development of UV and EUV lithography technology | EUV]] required a profound grasp of physics and fundamental dynamics to address energy efficiency and debris mitigation challenges, ultimately leading to the commercially viable solution seen today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Scientists literally calculated exact parameters like opacity, temperature, droplet size, ion density, and emission duration years in advance, then built the machine to achieve these theoretical predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

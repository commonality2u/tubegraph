By the 1960s, the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet economy]] faced stagnation and a "desperate need for reform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This period saw various attempts to revitalize its command system, including ambitious proposals for a nationwide computer network like OGAS (All-State Automated System for the Management of the Economy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

## Structure of the Command Economy

For much of its history, the Soviet Union operated a command economy where the state owned everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Economic activity was coordinated through directives, quotas, and commands rather than a free market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Key state entities included:
*   **Gosplan (State Planning Commission)**: Responsible for writing five-year plans and defining economic inputs, including prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Gossnab (State Commission for Materials and Equipment Supply)**: Tasked with implementing Gosplan's directives by procuring and supplying producer goods for factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Gosbank**: Handled accounting and recorded transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Early Successes and Growing Inefficiencies

In its early years, the command economy demonstrated rapid growth, surpassing most other countries globally, and achieved significant technological and social advancements, particularly in military and aerospace sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

However, behind these successes, the central planning system struggled with effectively assigning quotas and redistributing outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This led to:
*   Immense paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>
*   Distorted incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>
*   Frequent miscommunications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>
*   Reliance on "pushers" â€“ fixer-type individuals who informally facilitated the meeting of quotas, especially outside the military sector, due to clogged formal channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

Attempts at reform during this period often exacerbated bureaucratic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. These [[challenges_faced_by_the_soviet_economy_in_its_later_years | challenges faced by the Soviet economy in its later years]] indicated a deepening systemic crisis.

## Attempts at Reform: The Rise of Cybernetics

Following Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev's leadership (1953-1964) introduced a series of reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. A notable reform was the normalization and adoption of cybernetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Previously banned under Stalin, cybernetics was praised by Khrushchev at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party in 1956 as a "major tool of the creation of a communist Society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This encouraged the development of computer science and industrial automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Soviet cybernetics evolved into a project to introduce mathematical methods to life and social sciences, imbuing it with an "aura of Truth and objectivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Soviet leaders, including Khrushchev, believed computers could offer a universal solution to the nation's ailing economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### OGAS: The Soviet Internet That Never Was

The idea for a nationwide computer network gained momentum after news of the American SAGE air defense system in 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Soviet military efforts, such as the "System A" air defense network, demonstrated the potential of networked computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

Anatoli Kitov, an early pioneer in Soviet cybernetics, proposed the first civilian effort to network the nation in 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. He envisioned a "unified State network of computing centers" and later, a "unified automated management system" (EASU), which would connect factories and government agencies via large military computers buried underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This system, he argued, would maximize the command economy's advantages of centralization and achieve immense financial savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Kitov's proposal, however, met with opposition from the military and led to his professional downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Despite Kitov's setback, Victor Glushkov, head of the Kiev Institute of Cybernetics, advanced the concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. In 1963, Soviet leadership approved research into economic reform using automated computer networks (ASUs), aiming to bridge the growing technology gap with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

Glushkov's vision for OGAS in the early 1960s was highly ambitious:
*   **Hierarchical Structure**: Three tiers including 20,000 computer terminals at the factory level (ASUs), 100-200 regional planning systems, and a central planner in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **Automated Planning**: The system aimed to "rationally and automatically plan, optimize, and produce the country's National economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **"Nervous System" Metaphor**: OGAS was intended to be the "nervous system" of the Soviet Union, connecting factories and workers (the "body") with leadership (the "brain") to enable unified movement and coordination, eliminating bureaucratic inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This was seen as a Soviet counterpoint to the Western self-regulating market economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## Obstacles to Implementation

Glushkov's initial OGAS proposal in 1964, despite its potential, never fully developed due to several factors:
*   **Cost**: The estimated cost was 160 billion rubles (approximately 1.4 trillion USD in 2016), more than the combined Soviet space and atomic bomb programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   **Technological Limitations**: While Soviet military computers had "World leading capabilities," civilian computer technology lagged, and the military was unwilling to transfer its specialized systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. These [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | economic and political factors affecting Soviet computing]] were significant.
*   **Bureaucratic Resistance**: Communist Party bureaucrats (especially in Gosplan) and industrial managers objected to the idea of being replaced or dictated to by computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. The Central Statistical Administration, in particular, feared that objective data collection would "restrain their own power to control the flow of information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **"All or Nothing" Approach**: Glushkov's plans required a complete reformation of the country's management system, a revolutionary change that proved too daunting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

## Political Shifts and The Softening of OGAS

In 1964, Khrushchev lost power, replaced by Leonid Brezhnev, who reversed many of his predecessor's economic reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. However, the directive for economic restructuring via computers remained on the agenda due to high-level backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Gosplan and the Central Statistical Administration, however, "thoroughly rejected the Project's utopian Vision," seeking to control its resources for their own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

The widespread news of ARPANET in 1969 spurred the OGAS project forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. Glushkov modified his vision: the new OGAS would function as a "universal information Bank" organizing data flow, rather than running the entire economy like a nervous system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

At a Politburo meeting on October 1, 1970, Glushkov presented this scaled-back OGAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Despite initial positive reception, the Minister of Finance, Vasili Garbuzov, fearing erosion of his ministry's power, dismissed OGAS as a "silly project" and proposed a far more conservative counter-proposal, which won over the Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. The full OGAS proposal was neither fully accepted nor rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

Throughout the 1970s, individual ASUs were built in factories, numbering in the hundreds or thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. However, they were built haphazardly and without standardization, making a nationwide unified network impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

Ultimately, the failure of the Soviet internet was rooted in bureaucratic infighting, as various power centers objected to its capabilities and hijacked it for their own needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. The deeper reason was that the project "challenged how the Soviet Union ran things," a system only a couple of decades away from implosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. This contributed to the overall [[challenges_faced_by_the_soviet_economy_in_its_later_years | challenges faced by the Soviet economy in its later years]].

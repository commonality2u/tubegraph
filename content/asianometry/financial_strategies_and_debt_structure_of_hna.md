At its peak, China's HNA Group managed an estimated $170 billion in assets globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The conglomerate rapidly acquired holdings in diverse sectors, including stakes in Deutsche Bank and Hilton Hotels, ownership of airports and real estate in Germany, China, and the United States, and the world's third-largest aircraft leasing business with over 900 planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Most of these [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna | acquisitions and investments]] occurred within a few years, with multi-million or billion-dollar transactions happening monthly by May 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Early Financial Mechanisms

HNA's initial funding came from the Hainan provincial government, which contributed 10 million RMB (approximately $1.4 million) as startup capital for Hainan Provincial Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Recognizing this was insufficient, co-founder Chen Feng and his colleague restructured the business as a joint-stock company in 1993, allowing private individuals to acquire shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This share sale raised 250 million RMB (about $35 million) from 122 stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

A key early financial strategy involved leveraging loans from Chinese banks. Despite banks' limited understanding of mortgages at the time, HNA convinced them to assign property rights of purchased planes to the borrower, HNA Group, rather than claiming the plane as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This enabled HNA to "re-mortgage" the same plane to another bank for more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. They also borrowed against future revenue streams from the plane's air routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This "one plane, two mortgage" approach allowed HNA to double-dip their leverage and grow rapidly, relying on long loan terms (10-15 years for plane loans) to figure out repayment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This perilous method often meant taking out new loans to pay back old ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

In 1995, George Soros's Quantum Fund invested $25 million in Hainan Airlines, marking the first Chinese-American joint venture in China's aviation space and boosting HNA's image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Soros doubled his investment to $50 million in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, but his fund eventually sold its stake in 2011 due to HNA's lack of corporate transparency and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Murky Ownership and [[fraud_and_financial_mismanagement | Financial Mismanagement]]

HNA's ownership structure was notoriously complicated and opaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. At its IPO, co-founders Chen Feng and Wang Jian held minuscule personal stakes, but controlled a shell company that was the second-largest shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. From 2002 to 2015, the controlling shareholder was a Hainan Airlines Trade Union, later replaced by the Hainan Cihang Charity Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The foundation, established by HNA, was likely a "stealth vehicle" for Chen Feng to control the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Instances of [[fraud_and_financial_mismanagement | financial mismanagement]] and self-dealing were apparent:
*   Chen Feng's brother set up an American firm to buy engines and spare parts for the airline's fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   Wang Jian's brother, Wang Wei, profited from building high-end villas and a golf course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   HNA generated paper profits by moving assets between subsidiaries at favorable prices. For example, HNA sold a 95% stake in its Beijing HQ building to its subsidiary Hainan Airlines for 1.7 billion RMB, recording a 1.1 billion RMB profit on a building it had acquired at cost from the same subsidiary a year earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## Navigating Crises and Reloading Debt

HNA faced significant financial challenges, coming close to [[bankruptcy_and_restructuring_of_hna_group | bankruptcy]] during the 2003 SARS epidemic with a 1.5 billion RMB loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. The Hainan provincial government, despite its small financial stake, injected 1.5 billion RMB, saving the airline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

The 2008 Global Financial Crisis again led to a substantial loss of 1.73 billion RMB for HNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The company survived this period due to:
*   Another 1.5 billion RMB injection from the Hainan provincial government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   A 4 trillion RMB stimulus package by the Chinese government in November 2008, which caused land prices to skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. HNA benefited immensely from 9,000 acres of land it acquired in Haikou (Hainan's capital), which became extremely valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This allowed HNA to sell 4 billion RMB of bonds and 2.8 billion RMB of stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

## The "Super X Plan" and Debt-Fueled Acquisitions

Despite two near-[[bankruptcy_and_restructuring_of_hna_group | bankruptcy]] experiences, HNA decided to expand aggressively with its "Super X plan," aiming to accumulate 1 trillion RMB of assets in just five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Between late 2010 and 2017, HNA spent billions on [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna | hotel brands, technology companies, urban real estate, and airports]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This frenzy peaked from 2015 to 2017, with 123 acquisitions totaling $50 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

The vast majority of money for these acquisitions was borrowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>, primarily through:
1.  **Land and Land Development**: HNA shifted from mortgaging planes to mortgaging land development projects and other hard assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. They partnered with indebted provincial and city governments for infrastructure projects, leasing assets to help governments "duck their debt limits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. These projects were then spun off into publicly traded subsidiaries, whose skyrocketing net asset values allowed HNA to pledge shares for even more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.
2.  **Complex Capital Structure**: HNA evolved into an intricate web of China-based investment entities, including 10 publicly traded on Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets and seven on Hong Kong markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. As HNA acquired companies or stakes, they could inject these acquisitions into their complex web and re-mortgage them for more funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. This structure made it difficult to discern true ownership and debt links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

## The Inevitable Implosion

In mid-May 2017, HNA issued $500 million in bonds for its 245 Park Avenue purchase in New York City, one of its last overseas M&A financing transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.
The turning point arrived on June 22, 2017, when the China Banking Regulatory Commission ordered risk checks on the overseas borrowing and investing of HNA and other conglomerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. Following this:
*   Major banks like Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Bank of America, and Goldman Sachs stopped accepting HNA shares as pledges for new loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.
*   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority requested information on HNA's financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   In November 2017, HNA issued $300 million in dollar bonds at an extremely high 8.875% interest rate, indicating rising yields on its debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   The Chinese central government criticized HNA's Sanya new airport reclamation project for "suspected illegal use of the sea," eroding confidence in the company's perceived government connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

In late November 2017, HNA reported an estimated current loan balance of 637 billion RMB ($94 billion USD), a 36% increase from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. Including unlisted subsidiaries, estimates reached as high as 1 trillion RMB ($148 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>, making HNA Group Asia's most indebted company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. Credit rating agencies quickly downgraded its debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

By January 2018, HNA management met with creditors, announcing plans to unwind its build-up and return to its core airline business, aiming to sell 100 billion RMB of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. A third of HNA's publicly traded affiliates had their share trading suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>, including its tourism, leasing, shipping, and airline businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. For some, HNA had pledged up to 60% of total shares in circulation for loans, a key source of cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

Throughout 2018, HNA began rapidly selling off assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>, but the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its core airline and travel businesses ultimately triggered a final crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. On February 2021, HNA finally entered [[bankruptcy_and_restructuring_of_hna_group | bankruptcy proceedings]], acknowledging $170 billion in debts from creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. Co-founder Chen Feng and chief executive Adam Tan were detained by the Chinese government in September 2021 for suspected crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.

HNA's rapid rise and fall, characterized by mountains of debt and an incredibly complex and opaque structure, ultimately ended when the implied close [[role_of_government_in_hnas_expansion | government involvement]] or the ability to dodge oversight could no longer sustain it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.

A zipper, also known as a slide fastener, is a device used to join and bind the edges of two fabrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>. While the modern slide fastener was invented by Whitcomb Judson in 1891 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>, it was Gideon Sunback's 1917 patent of the "hookless number two" that introduced the interlocking teeth structure seen today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:57">[01:51:57]</a>. Critically, Sunback also invented a machine capable of efficiently producing this design at scale, which was vital for its widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:18">[02:02:18]</a>. The term "zipper" originated in 1923 when B.F. Goodrich used it for a rubber boot product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:37">[02:30:37]</a>.

## Zipper Components and Function

Zippers consist of three main components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:25">[07:23:25]</a>:
*   **Tape:** The fabric part of the zipper to which the teeth are attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:23">[08:00:23]</a>.
*   **Teeth (Elements):** These are the parts that mesh together to open and close the zipper, forming a "chain" when interlocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:16">[07:28:16]</a>.
*   **Slider:** The component that moves up and down, engaging with the elements to lock or unlock them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:02">[07:48:02]</a>.
*   **Stops:** Zippers may also have stops at the ends to prevent the slider from coming off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:39">[07:54:39]</a>.

An unusual aspect of a zipper's cost is that 88% of it comes from the main materials and labor, with linings, fastenings, and other accessories making up the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:07">[08:05:07]</a>.

## Manufacturing Process for Metal Zippers

The creation of a metal zipper involves several precise steps:
1.  **Wire Preparation:** The process begins with pre-made metal wire, often a copper-zinc alloy for rust resistance, formed into a Y-shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:10">[08:19:10]</a>.
2.  **Element Shearing:** A tiny chip is sheared off the wire's end, which will become an individual element or tooth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:53">[08:40:53]</a>.
3.  **Forging the Protrusion (Scoop):** A small hook-like protrusion, sometimes called a "scoop," is forged into the element. This scoop is essential as it catches other teeth, helping to keep the zipper closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:04">[08:47:04]</a>.
4.  **Attaching to Tape:** Finally, the element's two legs are bent to attach it securely to the fabric tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:12">[09:08:12]</a>.

### The Role of Automation

Mechanical automation is critical for economical and effective zipper production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:03">[09:18:03]</a>. A poorly made zipper can render an otherwise good garment useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:01">[09:25:01]</a>.
Chain machines are used to automatically and accurately attach the teeth to the tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:04">[09:32:04]</a>. [[YKK company history and global dominance | YKK]] recognized the importance of these machines early on, importing American-made chain machines in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:12">[09:36:12]</a>. These machines significantly boosted productivity, enabling the work of 160 manual laborers to be done by just six individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:21">[10:01:21]</a>.

### [[YKK company history and global dominance | YKK]]'s Manufacturing Innovations

[[YKK company history and global dominance | YKK]] continuously improved these machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:37">[10:37:37]</a>. By 1953, they modified the machines to attach teeth at regular time intervals, eliminating the need for spacers on the tape and greatly speeding up manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:37">[10:37:37]</a>. Further enhancements made the machines easier to operate by a single person and increased production volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:43">[10:52:43]</a>.

[[YKKs strategy of vertical integration and market adaptation | YKK]]'s strong belief in [[YKKs strategy of vertical integration and market adaptation | vertical integration]] led them to establish factories that produce everything from the metal for wires to the textiles for tapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:07">[11:03:07]</a>. This control over the entire supply chain, combined with their automation prowess, gave them a significant market advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:09">[11:38:09]</a>.

## Types of Zippers and Market Adaptation

In response to evolving fashion trends, [[YKK company history and global dominance | YKK]] introduced new zipper styles that [[comparison_between_ykk_and_competitors_like_talon_and_fujian_sps_zipper | competitors]] like [[comparison_between_ykk_and_competitors_like_talon_and_fujian_sps_zipper | Talon]] failed to adapt to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:13">[14:04:13]</a>:
*   **Concealed Zipper:** This design hides the teeth by blending into the garment, a long-desired feature by garment manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:41">[14:17:41]</a>.
*   **Plastic Injection Mold Zippers:** These zippers can be dyed in vibrant colors, appealing to the flashy fashions of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:05">[14:29:05]</a>.

## Conclusion

The evolution of the zipper over more than a century demonstrates that manufacturing can be as technologically sophisticated as any modern industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:07">[16:27:07]</a>. Immense work and research and development have been necessary to achieve the advancements in zipper technology that are often taken for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>.

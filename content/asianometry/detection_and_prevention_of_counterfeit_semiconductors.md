The semiconductor industry faces a significant problem with [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|counterfeit chips]] that pose substantial risks, especially in critical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Incidents and Risks

In 2020, an F-16 ejection seat malfunctioned, resulting in the pilot's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. An investigation of the seat's sequencer discovered that several microchips inside were [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|counterfeit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While the specific role of these chips in that incident remains unclear, it highlights the significant danger posed by fake chips in critical situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|Defining Counterfeit Semiconductors]]

The definition of a [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|counterfeit semiconductor]] is broad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The Department of Defense offers two simple definitions:
1.  A previously used electronic part sold as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
2.  Unauthorized copies of an authentic electronic product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The industry provides a more comprehensive taxonomy, identifying a semiconductor as [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|counterfeit]] if it meets any of the following criteria:
*   It is an unauthorized copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   It does not conform to the original manufacturer's design, model, or performance standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   It is not produced by the original manufacturer or its authorized contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   It is off-specification, already used, defective, or misleadingly labeled as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   It is incorrectly marked or has wrong documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## [[Global Impact and Statistics on Counterfeit Electronics|Global Impact and Statistics]]

[[Global Impact and Statistics on Counterfeit Electronics|Counterfeit semiconductors]] represent a significant business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Tracking illegal activities is challenging, so most data is not always up-to-date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Organizations often discuss it as part of a larger piracy and [[Global Impact and Statistics on Counterfeit Electronics|counterfeit]] trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

*   In 2019, the OECD estimated that the global volume of [[Global Impact and Statistics on Counterfeit Electronics|counterfeit and pirated products]] accounted for up to 3.3% of total global trade, exceeding $500 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   The government's [[Counterfeit Chips in the Defense Sector|counterfeit]] parts database, the Government Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP), is not anonymous, which discourages victims from reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   The Electronic Resellers Association International (ERAI) monitors incidents; in 2022, they recorded 504 reported [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|semiconductor counterfeit]] cases, a sharp drop from 963 in 2021 and 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   A November 2011 US Congressional committee investigation on [[Counterfeit Chips in the Defense Sector|counterfeit electronic parts in the military supply chain]] quoted the Semiconductor Industry Association, estimating that counterfeiting cost the American [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry|semiconductor manufacturing industry]] over $7.5 billion annually in lost revenue and 11,000 jobs in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   In 2010, the Bureau of Industry Security under the Department of Commerce identified 7,114 detected [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|counterfeited microcircuit]] incidents across 387 companies within the [[Counterfeit Chips in the Defense Sector|defense industry]] in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This was an increase from 3,400 reported incidents in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|Counterfeited semiconductors]] span various types, including microprocessors, analog chips, memory, and radio frequency chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Resale values range from 11 cents to $500, with most being in the 11 cents to $10 range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## [[Counterfeit Chips in the Defense Sector|Counterfeit Chips in the Military Supply Chain]]

[[Counterfeit Chips in the Defense Sector|Counterfeit semiconductors]] have infiltrated military supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Notable Incident: P-8A Poseidon
During a 2011 Senate panel hearing, several incidents were discussed, including one involving a P-8A Poseidon plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   The plane's ice detection module, which warns pilots about ice formation, contained a component that falsely identified itself as a Xilinx FPGA unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Boeing discovered the [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|counterfeit]] when the part literally fell out of its socket after the plane took off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   The module's manufacturer, BAE, had purchased 300 such FPGAs from a California company that tested only 50 of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   Investigators traced the [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|counterfeit chip]] back to an affiliate of an electronics manufacturer in Shenzhen, [[Chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts|China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Challenges for Defense Contractors
Defense Department contractors and commercial system integrators face unique [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry|challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   They often need to use old parts for repair and maintenance, as original manufacturers may no longer produce components for systems introduced decades ago (e.g., F-15 planes introduced over 45 years ago) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   This necessitates relying on often "shady secondhand suppliers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   Despite these [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry|difficulties]], the US government places the onus of detecting and filtering out [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|counterfeit chips]] on these contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   The National Defense Authorization Act, signed by President Obama in January 2013, threatens contractors with civil and criminal penalties for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Legal Cases
A notable case involved Vision Tech in Florida, which knowingly sold fake chips as trademarked military-grade goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   Vision Tech employees were instructed to claim chips came from Europe, despite knowing they originated from [[Chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts|China]] and Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   They would send legitimate chips for samples but fake chips for purchased shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   The company generated nearly $16 million in sales from these goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   The company's administrative manager received a 38-month prison sentence for her role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Methods of Counterfeiting

### Recycling
Recycling is a primary method for [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|counterfeit chips]] to enter the supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   Workers receive scrap electronics, crack open casings, and remove printed circuit boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   Boards are heated over an open flame to melt solder and loosen components, which are then bashed off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Component markings are removed, and new coats and markings are applied to make them appear new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   This process subjects already old and worn-out e-waste components to immense damage and stress, often rendering them non-functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Relabeled or Remarked Chips
These chips are not what their markings claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Markings convey information about a chip's model, origin, and certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   A bad actor acquires chips, wipes away original markings, and adds new ones to make them seem more premium or expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   This has real consequences, especially for components requiring enhanced specifications, such as military-grade chips hardened against radiation or temperature damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:08:00]</a>. Suppliers might substitute cheaper commercial parts that do not meet hardening requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   Recycling and remarking counterfeits constitute about 80% of all counterfeiting incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Foundry Overproduction
Most semiconductor companies do not own their own fabs; they contract foundries, often overseas and without third-party oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   A foundry might produce more chips than contracted, either for yield reasons or to resell the extra production as [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|counterfeits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   The foundry benefits by selling a valuable design without investing in the R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   While reputable foundries risk their multi-billion dollar reputations, fabulous manufacturers can implement measures to prevent this, such as designing for better assurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Unauthorized Clones
Unauthorized clones are similar to foundry overproduction but originate from a third party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   Third parties clone chips to save on expensive R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   Design IP can be obtained through:
    *   **Reverse engineering:** Using tools like an electron microscope to analyze a chip's layers, which is harder for complex chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
    *   **Illegally acquiring design IP:** This can occur at any stage of the chip design and [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing|manufacturing process]], such as copying RTL code at a design house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   Clone [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|semiconductor counterfeits]] are harder to detect because they are often functionally similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. However, they may deviate from the original in technology and process, leading to erratic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## Detection Methods

[[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|Fake chips]] often enter products because contractors lack documented supply chain history and fail to thoroughly inspect products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

There are two main types of inspection methods for potentially [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|counterfeit chips]]:

### Physical Methods
These methods look for defects related to the chip's physical properties, including its exterior, shipping/packaging, connections, IC packaging, bonding wires, or die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **External Visual Inspection (EVI)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   More invasive methods like **X-ray** or **de-lidding** the chip to expose its internal components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   Some physical methods are destructive, limiting their universal application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Electrical Methods
These tests assess changes in a chip's component parameters (parametric tests) or whether it is functioning properly (functional tests) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   Electrical tests are highly effective but can be time-consuming and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Challenges in Detection
Detecting [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|counterfeits]] involves nuances, such as distinguishing normal physical defects from sanding procedures used to remove previous markings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. A balance must be struck between detection and financial/time concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Best practices involve designing a set of tests that provide high test coverage rather than total assurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

## Prevention and Mitigation

### Designed-for-Counterfeit Measures
With recycling and package remarking being significant problems, fabulous designers can embed new features into chip designs to aid in detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. These are called "designed for [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|counterfeit]] measures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   **Unique ID:** Giving a chip a unique, non-programmable ID that can be easily read throughout its lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Physical Unclonable Feature (PUF):** Creating a unique "fingerprint" for the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. An example is an Arbiter PUF, which uses random variables in the [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing|semiconductor fabrication process]] to produce a circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Sending a "challenge" signal through the circuit produces a random but repeatable output, similar to a two-step authentication app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   While these methods can be effective, [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|counterfeiters]] can still tamper with them, or their implementation might be prohibitively difficult due to cost or technical reasons (e.g., lack of space on a chip) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
*   Blockchain proposals using PUFs aim to track chip supply chain history through traceability and immutability, but they require broad acceptance across various players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

### Addressing Root Causes: E-Waste Management
Most [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|counterfeit chips]], especially recycled ones, enter the supply chain due to opportunity and incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   In 2019, only 17.4% of the world's electronic waste (e-waste) was documented as collected and recycled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. This e-waste is often harvested for fake semiconductor components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   Harvesting and desoldering old chips from e-waste can cost as little as 10 cents per chip, while certain types of chips can sell for $1 to $10, creating a significant profit margin (up to 100 times the harvesting cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
*   This profitability, combined with massive imports of improperly managed e-waste from developed areas like the United States and Europe, fuels the [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors|counterfeit chip problem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   Throughout the 2010s, most fake recycled and relabeled chips originated from [[Chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts|China]] because that was where most e-waste was sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   In 2017, [[Chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts|China]] banned the import of 24 types of solid waste, including plastic and e-waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. While some e-waste is still smuggled into [[Chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts|China]], significant imports have redirected to new countries; for instance, Thailand saw a 5.7 times increase in e-waste imports in 2017 after the ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

The proper functioning of semiconductors is critical for the modern world, from military equipment to everyday vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. A chip that is not what it claims to be can cause serious harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

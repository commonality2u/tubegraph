Australia stands as the world's leading exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. In 2020, the country exported $25 billion worth of natural gas primarily to Asian markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite its leading export status, Australia occasionally experiences [[domestic_natural_gas_shortages_in_australia | natural gas shortages]] in its domestic markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This situation highlights Australia's vast size, abundant natural resources, and complex energy politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Natural Gas Reserves and Characteristics

Australia possesses significant proven natural gas reserves, estimated at approximately 3 trillion cubic meters in conventional reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. If unconventional gas fields like coal seam gas and shale gas are included, the total could be as high as 12 trillion cubic meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. However, much of this gas is unevenly distributed, with nearly 80% of conventional gas resources concentrated in the country's northwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Natural gas is a complex blend of hydrocarbons and non-hydrocarbons, predominantly methane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. It is odorless, colorless, and lighter than air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Scientists believe it originates from organic matter trapped within sediment deposits over millions of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

Geologists classify natural gas fields into two main categories:
*   **Conventional Gas** refers to free gas trapped in porous reservoir rocks such as carbonates, sandstones, and salt stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Unconventional Gas** is an umbrella term for other types, generally harder to access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Examples include:
    *   **Shale gas**, trapped in tiny pores within shale rock deep underground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
    *   **Coal seam gas**, absorbed and trapped near the surface in coal deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Historical Context: From Coal to Gas

Historically, Australia has been a major coal exporter, starting after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Today, Australia is the world's second-largest coal exporter, trailing only Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. When Australia's first commercial gas field came online in the 1960s, natural gas was recognized as a premium fuel due to its low pollutant characteristics compared to coal, leading to its use in electricity generation and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## [[challenges_in_transporting_and_distributing_natural_gas_in_australia | Challenges in Transporting Natural Gas]]

Transporting natural gas presents significant challenges due to the remote location of reserves from population centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Transportation Methods

*   **Pipelines**: Convenient and economical for shorter distances, but lack flexibility and can be politically controversial for intercontinental projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)**: For longer distances (over 700 miles overseas or 2,200 miles on land), LNG becomes more economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Cooling natural gas to -260 degrees Fahrenheit transforms it into a condensed liquid, reducing its volume to 1/600th of its gaseous state, making it easier to transport via tanker ships or trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The primary drawback is the high upfront cost of building expensive liquefaction plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Australia's Fragmented Pipeline System

A critical issue for Australia, a very large country, is the absence of an integrated nationwide gas pipeline system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Its 47,000-kilometer network consists of three largely separate subsystems: the northern, western, and eastern markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Each market relies on its own local gas fields and pipeline infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This patchwork system, influenced by physical distance and varying regulatory regimes, contributes to a significant national energy security problem, preventing the transfer of gas from areas of abundance to areas of urgent need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## [[history_and_development_of_australias_natural_gas_industry | The Northwest Shelf Venture]]

In the 1960s and 1970s, as new natural gas fields were discovered, foreign interest in a large gas field in central Australia sparked feelings of economic nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. In 1970, Australia's federal government imposed a general export embargo on LNG to prioritize domestic requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Project Genesis and Early Challenges

The Northwest Shelf Project began as a joint venture involving Australian companies like Woodside Petroleum and Mid-Eastern Oil, alongside [[government_policies_and_international_partnerships_in_australias_lng_market | foreign multinationals]] such as Burma Oil, Royal Dutch Shell, British Petroleum, and California Asiatic Oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. After years of limited success and changes in partnership, natural gas was finally discovered in 1971 at Scott Reef <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, followed by additional discoveries at North Rankin and Goodwin, collectively estimated to hold over 300 billion cubic meters of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. These discoveries provided sufficient gas for the Western Australian market, prompting the joint venture to plan a massive $12 billion project to develop resources, build an LNG plant, and export LNG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

A major hurdle was the existing nationwide natural gas export ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. The left-wing federal government at the time also expressed reservations about the involvement of [[government_policies_and_international_partnerships_in_australias_lng_market | foreign multinationals]], demanding at least 50% local ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Woodside, the primary operator, needed foreign funds and expertise to fully exploit the resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Without export capability, the Western Australian market alone was too small to justify the multi-billion dollar investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The idea of supplying Australia's eastern markets was hindered by distance and the lack of an integrated pipeline system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The distance from Dampier to Sydney (3,202 miles) was too great for private entities to build an economically viable pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The Whitlam federal government proposed a national pipeline grid and took over an ongoing pipeline project from Moomba to Sydney in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, but this project faced significant political and environmental challenges.

### Policy Shift and Project Realization

In 1975, a more right-leaning, business-friendly government came to power, eager to advance energy projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Obstacles began to be removed:
*   The venture naturally reached the 50% local ownership threshold after Burma Oil sold its stake to the Australian mining giant BHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   In 1977, the federal government lifted its export embargo, allowing the Northwest Shelf venture to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The policy stated that exports would be permitted only after domestic requirements were considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Initially, the venture was allowed to export 50% of its gas production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   The new government provided tax benefits, extending an investment allowance, introducing an income tax rebate, and waiving certain oil and resource taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

In 1978, the venture secured deals with eight Japanese customers to supply LNG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Driven by favorable oil market conditions, construction began in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The Northwest Shelf venture, built in two phases, was Australia's largest project to date and for a time, the world's single biggest engineering project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. It included offshore platforms, undersea gas pipelines, a massive LNG plant (12 million tons/year capacity), LNG tankers, and a pipeline from Dampier to Perth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. While LNG tankers were built abroad, over 75% of other materials were locally sourced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

First LNG exports to Japan commenced in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Japan remains a regular customer, later joined by the People's Republic of China; together, these two countries purchase 75% of Australia's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Today, the gas fields of Western Australia still account for about 80% of the country's proven reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, with over $25 billion invested in the project, including the massive Gorgon gas project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. By law, the Northwest Shelf project is required to reserve a significant portion of its production for domestic use, with natural gas meeting 64% of Western Australia's energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## Eastern Australian Gas Development and Current Landscape

Australia's northern and eastern markets, particularly the eastern market encompassing Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Hobart, face greater supply challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Australian domestic energy demand is growing rapidly, with consumption increasing by about 0.6% annually, driven by industrial demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Despite being the 55th largest country by population, Australia ranks 19th globally in electricity consumption per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

Australia's energy mix has shifted significantly towards renewables, with wind and solar contributions surging from 2% in 2010 to 18% in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. This growth has largely reduced coal's share (from 81% to 67%) and marginally impacted natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

The large energy market size and rapid growth spurred new developments in unconventional natural gas, especially [[history_and_development_of_australias_natural_gas_industry | coal seam gas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. The southern and eastern regions, lacking conventional gas fields, possess significant coal deposits with absorbed methane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Historically, this methane, a potent greenhouse gas, was vented during coal mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. After earlier attempts by companies like Conoco Australia, Mitsubishi, and Houston Oil and Minerals, BHP achieved a breakthrough in 1996 at the Bowen Basin in Queensland, initiating a [[history_and_development_of_australias_natural_gas_industry | coal seam gas]] boom in eastern Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Gas production grew ninefold due to domestic eastern market growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. State governments further encouraged this by advocating for a switch from coal to gas, exemplified by the Queensland Gas Scheme in 2005, which mandated electricity retailers to source 13-15% of their electricity from gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

While the Bowen Basin's coal seam reserves could serve eastern markets for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, export markets again became a focus. The Queensland state government approved three consortia to build LNG plants and export coal seam gas to Asian markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. The first of these, operated by Santos, came online in December 2014, followed by APLNG in January 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Today, three LNG plants on Curtis Island collectively produce 26 million tons of LNG annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Eastern Australia's proximity to Asia provides a price advantage for its LNG exports, despite higher labor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

In 2020, Australia surpassed Qatar to become the world's leading exporter of liquefied natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Australia's rise as a natural gas export power, combined with its reputation as a reliably Western-aligned country, has significantly contributed to stabilizing global energy markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Despite this, its domestic markets still face significant [[domestic_natural_gas_shortages_in_australia | energy shortages]] and rising prices, hindering growth and causing political challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Proposed solutions, such as a transcontinental pipeline or a nationwide gas reservation policy, are discussed, but a comprehensive, coherent national strategy is needed to resolve Australia's natural gas dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

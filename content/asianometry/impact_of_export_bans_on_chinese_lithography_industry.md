Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) is China's ambitious project aimed at replacing ASML in the lithography sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Recent high-profile export bans to China have brought special focus to SMEE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Historical Context and Government Support

China's first lithography machine, the GK3, was created in 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, followed by the JKG3 in 1979, which was the first domestically created machine for large-scale commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Despite early developments like the GK4 prototype in 1978, capable of printing on 75mm wafers using contact lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, China was two decades behind the United States, which invented and commercialized contact lithography in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Subsequent efforts included the development of proximity aligner prototypes in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> and a stepper in 1985, which was "inspired by" the US-based GCA 4800 DSW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. By 2000, China began research on machines using argon fluoride lasers (193nm wavelength), but a large technology gap remained as Western countries had started shipping such devices in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

SMEE was founded in March 2002, signaling a change in direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The Chinese government designated SMEE as the "national champion" for Project 02, a major national special project under the 12th five-year plan (2011-2015), ranked second only to nuclear power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Project 02 aimed to develop manufacturing equipment for 22-45 nanometer chips, conduct research for 14-22 nanometer processes, capture at least 10% of the domestic lithography market, and attempt to enter the international market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

SMEE has received extensive support from both local and central Chinese governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Shanghai SASAC, the commission overseeing the city's corporate assets, is SMEE's largest owner, holding 32% of its shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Impact of Import Restrictions on SMEE's Strategy

[[Technological and commercial progress in Chinas lithography sector]] is a protected space dominated by three companies with government backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. SMEE encountered import restrictions almost from its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. For example, high-level optics from Carl Zeiss of Germany, including their best products, could not be imported into China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

This forced SMEE to initially target less intense segments of the lithography market, such as advanced packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, which describes processes for placing a chip in its protective casing and connecting it to the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. The strategy was to gain experience in back-end lithography before advancing to front-end lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This approach has shown traction, with SMEE products holding 80% of the domestic market in back-end lithography, corresponding to 40% of the global market in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. SMEE also expanded into lithography tools for other niche semiconductor products, including power devices, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and LEDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Challenges with Core Components and Commercialization

SMEE operates on the ASML model, aiming to be the final system integrator for lithography tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The success of a machine relies on four core factors: high-precision optics, the light source, high-precision mechanics, and software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Due to import restrictions, SMEE relies on domestic suppliers for these components:
*   **Optics:** Beijing Guowang Technology Company is identified as SMEE's Carl Zeiss equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. However, Beijing Guowang is still building an optics manufacturing factory and is not expected to supply immersion-ready optical systems in mass until its completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Light Source:** Beijing RS Laser Opto Electronics Technology is SMEE's equivalent of ASML's Cymer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. RS Laser's products are underpowered compared to what ASML uses for its immersion systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Other Core Technologies:** A significant number of core technologies, such as photo masks (mostly made by [[japanese_dominance_and_decline_in_lithography | Japanese companies]] Topan Printing and Dai Nippon Printing), ball bearings from Sweden, valves from France, and grating alignment systems from the United States, still need to be imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Without these components, shipping commercial-grade, working machines is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

As of August 2021, SMEE systems are primarily for 90nm, 110nm, and 280nm processes, used in back-end lithography, LED, MEMS, and power devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Their most advanced system, the SSA 600-20 scanner for 90nm front-end manufacturing, uses an argon fluoride laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. A prototype of this product, the 600-10, profiled in 2011, could process about 50 wafers per hour, while comparable Canon and Nikon machines could do up to five times that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The 600-20 was estimated not to be selling in relevant quantities as of 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

SMEE's most prominent future product is an argon fluoride immersion (ArF-e) system, said to be capable of the 28nm process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This 28nm tool remains a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. China has historically been good at building prototypes that lag the leading edge by about 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. However, a significant challenge remains in transitioning from prototypes to commercially competitive products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. The goal was to deliver commercial-ready 28nm ArF-e machines by 2021 or 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, but this deadline is likely to be missed as the critical optics supplier, Beijing Guowang, is not expected to complete its foundry until September 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. A 2024 ship date might still be ambitious, and even then, the product is not expected to be commercially competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

For instance, an announcement in November 2018 about a "super resolution" 22nm lithography tool by the Institute of Opto Electronics Technology was highly publicized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. However, the tool was not commercially ready, had low accuracy, and a tiny field of view of a few square millimeters, meaning it would take an extremely long time to process a single wafer layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. By contrast, ASML's comparable Twinscan NXT 1970Ci has a field of view of 858 square millimeters and can process over 250 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

## Human Capital Challenges

Despite the immense value of skilled individuals in the semiconductor manufacturing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, SMEE faces challenges in attracting and retaining top talent compared to ASML. While entry-level college graduates at SMEE make about $45,000 USD a year, and PhDs about twice as much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, ASML offers significantly higher salaries, with some staff software engineers earning nearly $200,000 USD annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

Furthermore, ASML provides comprehensive benefits like a share purchase plan, pension plan, commuting allowance, 40 days of paid leave, and holiday allowance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. SMEE, as a national champion with expectations on par with Huawei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, has adopted Huawei's working practices, which include long hours, political intervention, tough annual assessments, and a Jack Welch-style bottom 5-10% layoff each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This approach is likely to hinder SMEE's ability to acquire and retain the necessary talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## Outlook

While Chinese media often portrays the photolithography effort as the "Mount Everest of the intelligent manufacturing industry" with strong rhetoric of China's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, the reality is that SMEE is at least 20 years behind ASML in bringing a commercial-ready, upper-class lithography device to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Immersion lithography is still nascent for SMEE, and EUV is even further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. This reality is acknowledged even by Chinese sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Such optimistic claims can be counterproductive, leading to pessimism when deadlines are missed and preventing a focus on actual problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

Despite these challenges, the progress in back-end lithography and LED lithography is "heartening," especially as China gains market share in the display industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. A few Chinese companies have built strong track records in specific semiconductor equipment areas, with one even acquiring TSMC as a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

SMEE is considering an IPO in the future, with potential valuations in the $5-10 billion range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. An IPO would likely release new information that could provide further insights into the company's progress and future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

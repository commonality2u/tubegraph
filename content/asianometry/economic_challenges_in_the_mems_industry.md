Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) are microsystems with both electric and mechanical functions, built using advanced techniques similar to those for integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Despite their miraculous technology, the [[the_future_and_potential_of_the_mems_industry | MEMS industry]] has long grappled with significant economic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This article explores the major economic problems associated with creating small mechanical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Introduction to MEMS and its Early Development
The dream of creating extremely small devices dates back to Richard Feynman's 1959 lecture, "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom," where he discussed manipulating atoms to create useful tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The first real MEMS product emerged in 1967 when Harvey Nathanson at Westinghouse developed the resonant gate transistor using pre-modern micromachining techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

MEMS truly "hit the big time" in 1979 when Hewlett Packard used silicon micromachining to develop an inkjet nozzle for thermal inkjet technology, which became the technology's most successful application at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. In the 1990s, the [[the_future_and_potential_of_the_mems_industry | MEMS industry]] found another major commercial use in sensors for acceleration, pressure, and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. These included automotive airbag sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> and medical blood pressure sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Economic Challenges
While [[Introduction to MEMS Technology and Its Applications | MEMS technology]] is revolutionary, its commercialization has faced persistent economic hurdles.

### High Manufacturing Costs
Achieving better machining costs is essential because it sets a high hurdle for payback and profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. However, large-scale MEMS fabrication is only one component of the total cost; other significant contributors include design and back-end steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Design Complexity
Designing MEMS is specialized and differs significantly from standard integrated circuit (IC) design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. One cannot simply miniaturize existing designs and expect them to function identically; for instance, at the micro scale, friction forces are much stronger than inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Unlike VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) in semiconductor design, which utilizes a modular approach with generic modules and standardized cell libraries, mechanical design, including MEMS, does not have such a standardized system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Mechanical components must be custom-tailored to accommodate specific weight, space, and energy restrictions of each product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. While VLSI objects primarily process signals, mechanical objects often need to contain liquids, rotate, slide, or support loads, making MEMS design extremely custom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### High Packaging Costs
Testing and packaging, often called the "back end" of the semiconductor production process, are crucial steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. For MEMS-based sensors, packaging accounts for a substantial majority—75% to 80%—of the final cost, a stark contrast to integrated chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. For example, an HVAC pressure sensor priced at $20-$30 sees the majority of its cost coming from packaging, while the raw die from a foundry costs less than 50 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

This cost disparity stems from a fundamental difference: an IC is a self-contained system where packaging primarily provides protection and external interfacing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Conversely, MEMS devices must intimately interact with the outside world; a pressure sensor, for instance, cannot be sealed in a hard plastic case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Consequently, the packaging for each MEMS die must be custom-designed for its particular application, adding significant cost and engineering effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

### Yield Issues and Price Erosion
Analog Devices, an early investor in MEMS with its miniaturized accelerometer, took nine years for its in-house manufacturing facility to become profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. A major factor is yield; a 10% yield means 9 out of 10 MEMS products are unusable, drastically increasing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Doubling the yield would halve the cost, but this is challenging to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This leads to overly optimistic projections and market prices that do not reflect the actual investment in development, production, packaging, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Relentless market price erosion, as high as 3% to 5% each quarter, severely impacts margins and discourages investment in other exciting potential applications for MEMS, such as micropropulsion for cube satellites, MEMS-based LiDAR mirrors for autonomous cars, or IoT sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## Outlook
Despite being called the "second silicon revolution" due to its ability to create microscopic moving parts that are smaller, cheaper, and perform better than larger counterparts, the [[the_future_and_potential_of_the_mems_industry | MEMS industry]] has been a victim of its own success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Its creativity and diversity hinder the establishment of widespread standards, and there is no overarching body like Sematech or DARPA guiding the industry forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. For the [[the_future_and_potential_of_the_mems_industry | MEMS industry]] to realize its full technical and commercial potential, various players—designers, foundries, vendors, and end-users—need to collaborate more closely to establish standards and address the under-invested issues that plague it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

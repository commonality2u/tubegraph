In the immediate years following World War II, Japan faced a significant [[japans_postwar_methamphetamine_crisis | methamphetamine crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. By 1948, it was estimated that 5% of Japanese males aged 16 to 25 were addicted to methamphetamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Another survey indicated that 30% of people aged 20 to 22 had either used or were currently using stimulants like amphetamines and meth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This stimulant abuse caught people by surprise and significantly altered the country's [[cultural_and_societal_attitudes_towards_meth_in_postwar_japan | attitudes towards such drugs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Initial Recognition and Public Attitudes

Signs of a meth crisis were evident as early as September 1946, when Tokyo's first meth addict was admitted to a hospital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The drugs fueling this crisis came from three main sources: pharmaceutical companies dumping huge post-war supplies into the civilian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, military stockpiles leaking out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, and informal markets and crime gangs diverting drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Many Japanese, including soldiers who took their pills home, were ignorant of the drugs' hazardous side effects and believed them harmless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Contemporary documents initially reflected a perceived positive upside of these drugs on working attitudes and stamina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### Shifting Public Perception

Two deaths publicly attributed to drug abuse helped turn [[cultural_and_societal_attitudes_towards_meth_in_postwar_japan | public attitudes against these stimulants]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>:
*   In October 1946, comedian Miss Wakana died of a heart attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   In January 1947, novelist Sakonosuke Oda died of a hemorrhage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
Although their deaths were likely not directly due to meth overdose, newspapers seized on their well-known drug habits to attribute their deaths to drug use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

In 1949, the Japanese government began debating controls on the distribution of "philippon" (a popular meth brand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The debate in the National Diet started with the predicament of street orphans who had lost parents to meth addiction and were committing crimes to fund their own habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The Ministry of Health and Welfare concluded that the root cause was adult dealers and smugglers hooking children on meth, rather than the children themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

However, many ordinary Japanese still believed that meth had a positive place in society, especially as a work productivity booster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. An editorial in the Journal of the Japan Medical Association noted that almost all journalists he met were using it regularly, excusing it as a need to boost work productivity due to poor pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Blame often fell on "immoral people" like entertainers and novelists who "abused" the drug, while "moral people" like office workers were seen as capable of using it "healthily" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Legal and Enforcement Measures

A major incident near Urawa City in Saitama in October 1950, involving the arrest of about 100 young people in connection to a mass sexual assault incident, highlighted the severity of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Many perpetrators suffered hallucinations and delusions linked to a meth drug called "neo-agotine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. It was discovered that Toyama Chemical produced over 10 million vials of the drug monthly, far exceeding its quota of 51,000, yet was fined only $14 due to the quota being a guideline, not a law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

This incident led to the realization that better controls were necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### The Stimulant Control Act of 1951

In June 1951, Japan passed the Stimulant Control Act of 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. This act criminalized the import, manufacture, trafficking, receipt, and possession of these drugs, particularly when done in concert with other crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

The police rapidly put the law into action:
*   In 1951, 17,528 people were arrested for stimulant-related offenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   However, the law initially lacked teeth, with a maximum offense of a three-year prison sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   The crackdown also shifted meth production from informal labs to organized crime, like the Yakuza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

By 1954, the epidemic was worse, with an anonymous census finding that 7.5% of respondents aged 15-30 used methamphetamine, and 75% of those injected over five vials a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The survey estimated over half a million abusers in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### Stricter Enforcement and Public Panic (1954)

A pivotal moment came in April 1954 with the rape and murder of a young primary school girl, Kyoko Hasada, in a school bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. The crime was committed by 20-year-old meth addict Shikichi Sakamaki, who was captured with 500 vials of meth and two needles, and reportedly said, "Even I myself cannot understand why I committed such a crime. Maybe it was hitopon that led me to do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

This led to an avalanche of meth-related headlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, including:
*   A young female office worker stabbed by a meth addict she had never met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   A 21-year-old addict randomly pushing three children into water where they drowned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
*   In May 1954, half of the 60 reported murders were linked to meth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

The media whipped up the panic, with the three biggest newspapers running drug-related headlines 43 times between July and December 1954, declaring it a time of "moral decay" or "moral insanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

In June 1954, Japan amended its Stimulant Control Act to crack down harder on the drug trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Arrests skyrocketed, with 6,000 people arrested in four months after the amendment, 46% for possession and the rest for usage or buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. The police were reorganized to focus on both demand and supply, conducting massive raids like one in Osaka in July 1954 involving 2,000 officers searching 800 buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Indictments surged from 43% in 1953 to 63%, and over 9,000 violators were jailed for stimulant-related offenses between 1951 and 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## Public Awareness Campaigns

The police heavily invested in publicizing the dangers of methamphetamine abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Case study interviews with afflicted addicts revealed similar stories: users initially unaware of dangerous effects, often for studying or productivity, unexpectedly becoming addicted, leading to hallucinations and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

Police aimed to warn young people specifically, as 50% of addicts took their first dose between ages 15 and 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Over 24 million yen was spent on posters telling people to avoid stimulant drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Police distributed 225,000 pamphlets, 470,000 leaflets, and 385,000 posters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   Posters ranged from encouraging ("Let's Wipe Out the evil of stimulant drugs") to gruesome (images of syringes plunged into a teenage boy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   Special focus was placed on students preparing for year-end examinations, a period of exceptional stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   Lectures, roundtable discussions, and presentations were held at schools, factories, workplaces, and nightclubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

Combined with media blitzes, awareness increased significantly; a 1955 survey found that only 3% of youths had never heard of "hiropod" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

### Blaming Foreign Populations

Considerable blame was cast upon foreign Korean and Taiwanese populations, euphemistically referred to as "Third Country residents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. A nationalist narrative emerged, portraying the epidemic as a threat from "bad forces abroad," possibly Communists smuggling drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. This helped shift [[cultural_and_societal_attitudes_towards_meth_in_postwar_japan | public attitudes against methamphetamine use]] by painting it as a threat to Japan's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. In 1954, the Tokyo Police claimed 70% of illegal meth labs were run by Koreans, failing to note they specifically targeted Korean villages for drug raids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. This dubious data caused problems for ethnic minorities who already faced discrimination and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

## Decline of the Crisis

Sustained police activity successfully brought down drug crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. By 1957, census cards showed a decline in methamphetamine use among the Japanese population, and offenses and arrests began to decline year after year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. By 1962, the "heropon Panic" had largely ended, with meth-related arrests declining to about 300-800 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

However, this did not mean addicts stopped taking drugs entirely; many young people switched to sniffing solvents, with related crimes skyrocketing to 20,000 in 1968 and 50,000 in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

The causes for [[japans_postwar_methamphetamine_crisis | Japan's postwar meth crisis]] could be pinpointed to:
*   Abundant legal and illegal supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   A lack of awareness about the drug's addictiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   Terrible economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

Changing the first two elements—supply reduction and increased awareness—and an alleviation of the third (economic conditions) helped reverse the situation and end the "heropon Panic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

Bulgaria developed a formidable computer and electronics industry, becoming an export powerhouse within the Eastern Bloc. By 1989, Bulgaria alone exported more computers than all other Eastern Bloc countries combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It was also the only COMECON country producing hard disk drive memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The electronics industry employed over 11% of all Bulgarian workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a> and produced some of the world's first electronic calculators and personal computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. These products became iconic brands in Southeastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

This article details the [[rise_and_fall_of_the_bulgarian_computer_industry | rise and fall of the Bulgarian computer industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Beginnings

The Third Bulgarian State, established in 1878, began as a relatively poor, largely agricultural economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. After World War II, during which Bulgaria sided with the Axis powers, the Soviet Union marched into the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The Bulgarian Communist Party overthrew the czarist government, abolished the monarchy, and established the People's Republic of Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The Party rebuilt the country, modeling its economic policies after the Soviet Union, which provided loans, raw materials, and bought Bulgarian finished goods at generous terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Todor Zhivkov's Vision

Following Stalin's death in 1953, Todor Zhivkov assumed leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, ruling for 35 years until 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. His moderate rule provided unprecedented political and economic stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Zhivkov, who admired the Japanese economy, focused Bulgaria's economic policy on producing machinery and tools for heavy industry, seeing electronics as the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. He stated, "electronics was my weakness... I saw it as our future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## The Bulgarian Computer Gap

In the 1950s, Bulgarian scientists began studying Soviet cybernetics and the economic potential of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. While the Soviet Union's MESM computer was operational by 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, and other COMECON countries like [[east_germanys_semiconductor_industry_history | East Germany]] (ZRA-1 in 1956) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, Czechoslovakia and Romania (1957) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, Hungary (1958) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, and Poland (1959) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> built their own, Bulgaria lagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Catch-up efforts were hindered by the West's COCOM export restrictions, which prevented the purchase of high-technology tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Computing Center and Vitosha

In 1956, Professor Ljubomir Iliev attended a conference in Moscow where Soviet delegates recommended that all socialist countries establish their own computing centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Returning to the Mathematical Institute within the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Iliev conveyed this message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. In 1961, the Council of Ministers approved a new computing center, renamed the Mathematical Institute with Computing Institute (ИМ с ИЦ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

In 1962, Iliev's team began work on the Vitosha (Витоша), Bulgaria's first digital computer, completed in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Modeled after Romania's CIFA computer, Vitosha was large (4m long, 2m tall), used 1,500 vacuum tubes, and had a magnetic drum memory of 4,096 40-bit "words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. It consumed 12 kilowatts, processed 2,000 operations per second, and outputted results via an electrical typewriter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Vitosha was demonstrated at the "Bulgaria Builds Socialism" exhibition in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Sadly, it was ruined by a burst water pipe and scrapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## ELKA and Industry Push

The success of Vitosha spurred political support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Although Bulgaria imported a Soviet Minsk 2 computer in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, which discouraged further Vitosha-style development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, a report by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and Mechanical Engineering Committee identified electronics as a profitable export industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Electronics production was labor-intensive (especially for cheaper female labor) but required few raw metals and yielded high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The Council of Ministers allocated resources and hard currency for this industry, led by Professor Ivan Popov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Ivan Popov's Entrepreneurial Drive

Professor Ivan Popov is considered the founder and main driving force of Bulgaria's computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. In late 1964, Popov presented the Mathematical Institute with a Sumlock ANITA calculator, the world's first all-electronic calculator, challenging them to produce their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. A small team re-engineered the ANITA's design, replacing unavailable Dekatron tubes with transistors—a brilliant choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Meet ELKA

This led to the ELKA (ЕЛКА) 6521, short for "electronic calculator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Weighing 8.5 kg and using Germanium transistors, ELKA 6521 performed square root and integer division calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. It was one of the first transistorized, all-electronic desktop calculators, comparable to the American Friden EC-130 and Japanese Sharp CS-10A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

In April 1965, ELKA 6521 was demonstrated to Zhivkov and the Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Popov then took it to the INFORGA-65 show in Moscow, bluffing about existing large-scale factories to secure a five-year sales contract with Soviet Gosplan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Although the initial ELKA 6521 wasn't widely purchased by the Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, a simplified, cheaper version, the ELKA-22, and a model with a printer, the ELKA-25 (possibly the first of its kind), were produced in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

Popov secured a deal with Gosplan for the ELKA-22 at 700 roubles per unit, outbidding [[industrial_challenges_faced_by_east_germany_in_semiconductor_production | East Germany]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. In 1967, Bulgaria established DSO IZOT, an industrial conglomerate for calculating machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. From 1967 to 1984, IZOT generated over 11 billion leva in export revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Exports went to the Soviet Union, Switzerland, and Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. The ELKA-42, an IC-based electronic calculator, was displayed at the Osaka World Expo in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. ELKA also branched into IC-powered cash registers, exporting thousands to Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Bulgarian Semiconductors

Simultaneously with IZOT's founding, the Bulgarian government established the Institute of Microelectronics, with a design house in Sofia and a production fab in Botevgrad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Led by physicist Yordan Kasabov, who had produced the country's first domestic MOS transistors, the Institute rapidly advanced Bulgaria's semiconductor capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Kasabov designed the IC for the ELKA-42 and oversaw its manufacturing using modern processes like photolithography, wet etch, deposition, ion implantation, and plasma etch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

Around 1972-1973, Kasabov and Lubomir Antonov visited Silicon Valley, observing the rapid growth of the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. They aimed to replicate powerful, flexible ICs like the AMD Am9300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Upon their return, they produced microprocessors like the CM-400, enabling advanced 4-chip calculators like the ELKA-50 series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

## Unified System of Computers (USC)

In 1969, the Soviet Bloc decided to produce the Unified System of Computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. To accelerate development beyond the slow CMEA (COMECON) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>, Ivan Popov and Soviet colleagues founded the Intergovernmental Commission on Computing Technology (IGCCT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Popov ensured Bulgaria played a vital role, securing the production of three valuable items out of 105: memory disks, magnetic memory tapes, and a processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

Bulgaria acquired technology through agreements with Western companies like Fujitsu (for memory tapes) and copied IBM's disk drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. Popov coordinated the rapid construction of seven new plants for various components like magnetic heads and ferrite memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. This strategy granted Bulgaria a monopoly on hard disk drives within the Eastern Bloc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, allowing them to sell at high prices. Bulgarian factories produced high-quality goods at large scale, using advanced equipment from Europe and the US, achieving margins of 200-300% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. These electronics exports, along with profitable Soviet oil re-export deals, bolstered the Bulgarian economy through the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### Popov's Exit and Continued Advancement

Ivan Popov's blunt nature led to his downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. In 1974, his proposal to build mainframes in direct competition with the Soviet Union and [[east_germanys_semiconductor_industry_history | East Germany]] led to his removal from the Politburo and banishment to Switzerland as ambassador <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

Despite this, IZOT later ventured into supercomputers in the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Bulgarian computers like the IZOT-1014 powered geological centers in the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a> and were exported to countries like India by 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

## Microcomputers (Pravetz)

Bulgaria also became an early participant in the personal computing boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. In 1979, microelectronics engineer Ivan Marangozov led a team at the Institute of Technical Cybernetics and Robotics to copy an imported Apple II computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. They produced an almost identical clone, the IMKO-1 (Индивидуален микро компютър (ИМКО-1)), featuring Cyrillic characters and tape cassette memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Limited runs of IMKO-1 were made and proved highly popular and functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

The team then developed the IMKO-2, based on the cheaper Apple IIe PC, for mass production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. It used a Synertek 6502 CPU and had an optional floppy drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. Production moved to a new factory in Pravetz, Zhivkov's hometown, leading to the commercial variant named Pravetz-82, for its launch year, 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

While expensive for the average Bulgarian, Pravetz PCs were accessible enough to become quite popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. Production scaled from 500 units in 1983 to 18,000 two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Many Bulgarians learned programming on Pravetz PCs in schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>, with over 500 computer clubs by 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. The Pravetz factory produced approximately 60,000 computers annually at its peak, exported to the Soviet Union, other COMECON countries, and even some Western nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## Challenges and Decline

By the late 1970s, despite being one of the top 10 biggest electronics manufacturing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>, [[bulgarias_technological_advancements_and_setbacks | Bulgaria's technological advancements and setbacks]] began to appear. The government stopped investing in microelectronics, possibly due to military and heavy industry priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This limited Bulgaria's semiconductor industry, preventing it from producing advanced ICs needed for pocket calculators, forcing IZOT to import foreign chips for its ELKA-100 series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. These imported chips cost precious foreign currency, making Bulgarian products more expensive than Japanese and Western alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

A critical missed opportunity arose when the American company Rockwell discussed a technology collaboration to build semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. A deal was struck, but State Security abruptly prevented its signing, reportedly because the Soviet Union felt the deal would bring Bulgaria too close to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. This was a devastating blow, ensuring more sophisticated Bulgarian computers would always rely on imported chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

### Collapse

By 1988, the Bulgarian computer industry employed over 169,000 people (12% of the labor force) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. However, 1989 saw Todor Zhivkov's resignation after 35 years in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. The electronics industry still employed 181,000 people in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>, but the collapse of the Soviet Union starting in 1991 proved fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. 95% of Bulgaria's electronics revenue came from the Soviet Bloc, with the USSR being the largest market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. As many products were reverse-engineered from Western designs, Bulgaria had no alternative markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. The industry's reliance on Western-sourced components (30-40% of a computer) became unsustainable as Bulgaria's currency weakened in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

The early 1990s saw Bulgaria's markets open up, leading to an influx of extremely cheap South Korean and Taiwanese PCs, which made Pravetz PCs uncompetitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. The factories closed in 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. The once-formidable industry collapsed, with employment plummeting from almost 200,000 to just 30,000 people within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

Bulgaria's link to the Soviet Union was a double-edged sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. The Soviets were the primary customer, and Bulgaria's monopoly on valuable computer parts was a significant economic boon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. However, this link also proved to be a massive handicap in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. It necessitated copying from the West, restricting exports, and prevented closer technological collaboration with Western countries, thereby capping its technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. Zhivkov's vision of turning Bulgaria into "another Japan" came tantalizingly close but ultimately vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.

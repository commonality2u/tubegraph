The presence of counterfeit microchips poses a significant risk in critical situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This issue impacts the semiconductor industry globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Defining a Counterfeit Semiconductor

A broad range of definitions exist for a counterfeit semiconductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The Department of Defense offers two simple definitions:
1.  A previously used electronic part sold as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
2.  Unauthorized copies of an authentic electronic product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

The industry's more comprehensive taxonomy defines a counterfeit semiconductor as such if it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>:
*   Is an unauthorized copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   Does not conform to the original manufacturer's design, model, or performance standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Is not produced by the original manufacturer or its authorized contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   Is off-specification, already used, defective, or misleadingly labeled as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Is incorrectly marked or comes with wrong documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Scope of the Problem

Counterfeit semiconductors represent a large illegal business, though precise data is hard to track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Most organizations discuss it as part of a wider piracy and counterfeit trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

*   In 2019, the OECD estimated that the global volume of counterfeit and pirated products constituted up to 3.3% of total global trade, exceeding $500 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   The Government-Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP) is a government counterfeit parts database, but its non-anonymous nature discourages reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   The Electronic Resellers Association International (ERAI) monitors incidents; their database recorded 504 reported semiconductor counterfeit cases in 2022, a drop from 963 in 2021, and 757 in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   A 2011 US Congressional committee investigation on counterfeit electronic parts in the military supply chain quoted the Semiconductor Industry Association, stating that counterfeiting cost the American semiconductor manufacturing industry over $7.5 billion annually in lost revenue and 11,000 jobs in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   A 2008 report by the Bureau of Industry Security (under the Department of Commerce) identified 7,114 detected counterfeit microcircuit incidents across 387 companies within the defense industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This was an increase from 3,400 reported incidents in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   Counterfeited semiconductors span various types, from microprocessors to analog, memory, and radio frequency chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Their resale value ranges from 11 cents to $500, with most falling in the 11 cents to $10 range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## [[counterfeit_microchips_and_military_incidents | Counterfeit Microchips and Military Incidents]]

*   **F-16 Ejection Seat Malfunction:** In 2020, an F-16 ejection seat malfunctioned, causing a pilot's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. An investigation of the seat's sequencer discovered several counterfeit microchips, though their exact role in the incident remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.
*   **P8A Poseidon Ice Detection Module:** During a 2011 Senate panel hearing, an incident involving a P8A Poseidon aircraft was detailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. An ice detection module component, which claimed to be a Xilinx FPGA unit, was found to be counterfeit after it literally fell out of its socket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The module's manufacturer, BAE, had purchased 300 such FPGAs from a California company that only tested 50 of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Investigators traced the counterfeit chip back to an affiliate of an electronics manufacturer in Shenzhen, China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### The Challenge for Contractors

Defense Department contractors and commercial system integrators often face a difficult situation as they need to use old parts for repair and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. For instance, the F-15 plane was introduced over 45 years ago, and its original parts are no longer manufactured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This often forces them to seek out "oft shady secondhand suppliers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Despite this, the US government holds contractors responsible for detecting and filtering out counterfeit chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. In January 2013, the National Defense Authorization Act was signed into law, imposing civil and criminal penalties on contractors for this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Case Study: Vision Tech

Vision Tech, a company in Florida, knowingly sold fake chips as trademarked military-grade goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Employees were instructed to claim chips came from Europe, despite knowing they originated from [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | China]] and Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. They would send legitimate chips for samples but fake ones for the actual purchased shipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The company made nearly $16 million from these sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The owner died before sentencing, but the administrative manager received a 38-month prison sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Types of Counterfeit Chips

### Recycled/Harvested Chips

Recycling is one of the most common ways counterfeit chips enter the supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The process involves:
1.  Receiving scrap electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
2.  Cracking open casings to remove printed circuit boards (PCBs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
3.  Heating PCBs over an open flame to melt solder and loosen components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
4.  Bashing boards to dislodge components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
5.  Removing original markings using various methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
6.  Sorting, reprocessing, and applying new coats and markings to appear new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

These E-waste components are old and worn, and the harvesting process subjects them to significant damage and stress, often rendering them non-functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Relabeled/Remarked Chips

These chips are not what their markings indicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Markings convey information about model, origin, and certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Changing them misleads users about the chip's capabilities and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. A bad actor acquires chips, removes original markings, and adds new ones to make them appear more premium or expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

This has serious consequences, especially for components requiring enhanced specifications, like military components hardened against radiation or temperature damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Suppliers might swap in cheaper commercial parts that lack these hardening requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Recycled and remarked counterfeits account for about 80% of all counterfeiting incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Foundry Overproduction

Most semiconductor companies contract overseas foundries for production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Sometimes, a foundry produces more chips than contracted, potentially for yield reasons, but also to resell the excess as counterfeits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This allows the foundry to profit from a valuable design without incurring R&D costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Unauthorized Clones

Unauthorized clones are similar to foundry overproduction but originate from a third party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. These third parties clone chips to save on expensive R&D for developing their own designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Design IP can be obtained through reverse engineering (e.g., using an electron microscope) or illegally acquiring the chip's design IP at various stages of the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

Clone semiconductor counterfeits are harder to detect because they are often functionally similar to authentic parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. However, they can deviate from the original in technology and process, leading to erratic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

## [[methods_of_detecting_counterfeit_chips | Methods of Detecting Counterfeit Chips]]

Counterfeit chips often enter products when contractors lack supply chain history documentation or fail to thoroughly inspect products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. There are two primary types of inspection methods:

### Physical Methods

These methods look for defects directly related to the chip's physical properties, such as issues with the exterior, shipping, packaging, connections, IC packaging, bonding wires, or die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Techniques include:
*   External Visual Inspection (EVI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   More invasive methods like X-ray or de-capping the chip to expose its internals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Some methods are destructive, limiting their use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Electrical Methods

These tests check for changes in the chip's component parameters (parametric tests) or whether the chip functions properly (functional tests) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. While often effective, they can be time-consuming and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

Detecting counterfeits is challenging due to nuances, such as distinguishing normal physical defects from evidence of prior markings being removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. A balance must be struck between detection thoroughness and financial/time concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Best practices involve designing a set of tests for high confidence rather than total assurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

## [[anticounterfeiting_measures_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Anti-Counterfeiting Measures in Semiconductor Manufacturing]]

With recycling being a significant problem and package remarking becoming harder to detect, "fabless" designers can incorporate "designed for counterfeit measures" into their chip designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Unique ID:** A simple measure is to give a chip a unique ID programmed into non-programmable memory, easily readable throughout its lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Physical Unclonable Feature (PUF):** This involves creating a unique fingerprint for the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. One example uses random variables from the semiconductor fabrication process to create an Arbiter PUF circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:13:00]</a>. A "challenge" signal sent through the circuit produces a random yet repeatable output, similar to a two-step authentication app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

While these methods can be effective, counterfeits can still tamper with them, or implementation might be prohibitively difficult due to cost or technical reasons (e.g., lack of space on a chip) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Blockchain proposals utilizing PUFs for supply chain traceability have been observed, but they require broad acceptance and concert with existing measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Root Causes and Global Impact

Most counterfeit chips, especially recycled ones, enter the supply chain due to opportunity and incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   In 2019, only 17.4% of the world's electronic waste was documented as collected and recycled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   Harvesting and de-soldering old chips from E-waste can cost as little as 10 cents per chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
*   Certain types of chips can sell for $1 to $10 each, meaning a fake recycled chip can fetch up to 100 times its harvesting cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. This significant profit margin incentivizes labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

This problem is exacerbated by massive imports of improperly managed E-waste from developed regions like the United States and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### [[impact_of_recycled_and_fake_chips_on_global_trade | Impact of Recycled and Fake Chips on Global Trade]]

Throughout the 2010s, most fake recycled and relabeled chips originated from [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | China]], where the majority of E-waste was processed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. However, in 2017, [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | China]] banned the import of 24 types of solid waste, including plastic and E-waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. While some E-waste is still smuggled into [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | China]], significant imports have redirected to new countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. For example, Thailand saw a 5.7 times increase in E-waste imports in 2017 following the [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | China]] ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

The modern world's reliance on semiconductors means that a chip that is not what it claims to be can cause serious harm, whether in military equipment, aircraft, or vehicle components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

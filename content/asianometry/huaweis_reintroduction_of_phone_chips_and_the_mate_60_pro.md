In late August 2023, Huawei quietly began selling its own phone chips again, with the Huawei Mate 60 Pro going on sale in its online store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The phone features the Kirin 9000s (麒麟9000s), a 7-nanometer class chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Although Huawei did not confirm the manufacturer, it is widely believed to be SMIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

> It's important to remember that labels like "7 nanometer" or "5 nanometer" are marketing names for classes of chips and do not represent the actual physical size of transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. These names signal a class of performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## The Phone and the Chip

The Mate 60 Pro is described as a very nice phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. According to TechInsights, the Kirin 9000s is a 107 square millimeter die, which is about 2% larger than the Kirin 9000 and 9000E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The Kirin 9000 was Huawei's last leading-edge chip, briefly produced using TSMC's 5-nanometer process before American sanctions ended that collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

The new 7-nanometer class chip is approximately 5-6 years behind the current leading edge, as TSMC has been shipping 3-nanometer class chips for devices like the iPhone 15 since 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Teardowns and speed tests suggest the Kirin 9000s supports 5G connectivity, though Huawei appears to be concealing this functionality, not mentioning 5G support in press releases and the phone's OS reporting 4G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The SoC's CPU core is a customization built on Arm IP, and its GPU appears to be a new custom design by Huawei or HiSilicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This new GPU design initially caused texture errors in games like Genshin Impact, which are expected to be fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis suggested that SMIC's early yields for this node are likely to be higher than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Yields typically start low but improve as the fab refines its processes, similar to how TSMC scaled its N7 yields for iPhone launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The more phones Huawei sells, the faster SMIC's yields will improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The 7nm chip is confirmed to be real, and the node that produced it appears to be very capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Why the Surprise?

The re-emergence of these chips should not be surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Earlier predictions suggested that a HiSilicon chip (Huawei's semiconductor design arm) would soon emerge using the [[huawei_and_smics_semiconductor_collaboration | SMIC N+2 process node]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Nikkei Asia also reported in early August 2023 that [[huawei_and_smics_semiconductor_collaboration | SMIC was working with Huawei]] on a new 5G chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

News of the [[huawei_and_smics_semiconductor_collaboration | SMIC N+2 process]] first broke in July 2022, when it was being used for a Bitcoin miner, which are good for improving a node due to their repetitive structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Producing a complex chip like the Kirin 9000s phone SoC is far more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. The successful production of this chip demonstrates the tremendous progress achieved by SMIC and Co-CEO Liang Mong-song in about a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## More Advanced Chips Are Coming

Further advanced chips are also expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. In January 2022, Dr. Burn Lin, a former TSMC R&D director, stated that SMIC could fabricate even 5-nanometer class chips using only multi-patterning with 193-nanometer immersion lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Immersion lithography remains a crucial technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

While the United States banned EUV lithography exports, 193-nanometer immersion machines like the Twinscan NXT 2000i are still used for 70-80% of lithography work in Intel, TSMC, and Samsung's latest nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The US initially refrained from banning 193i due to concerns about cooperation from Japan and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. These countries only joined the export restrictions on June 30, 2023, a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. ASML has been attempting to sell as many DUV immersion machines as possible before year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

This implies SMIC still possesses sufficient machines to scale up 7-nanometer production and move towards 5-nanometer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Therefore, a 5-nanometer class Huawei chip is fully expected within 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## An Emerging China-Only Supply Line

The Mate 60 Pro is more than just a high-performing chip; it is integrated into an ecosystem of domestic Chinese suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, allowing for feature-parity with market leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Bloomberg noted the phone's many domestic suppliers, including for the radio frequency front-end module and the satellite communications modem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. With the exception of memory, which appears to be from SK Hynix, the entire phone is effectively a China-only ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

The pieces are falling into place for a complete, self-contained [[developments_in_chinas_domestic_semiconductor_ecosystem | ecosystem within China]] to produce various domestic electronics, including smartphone SOCs, CPUs, edge AI NPUs, GPUs, and [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI accelerators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### AI is the Next Big Move

While a phone chip comparable to one from five years ago might not seem like a significant breakthrough, it will likely have a substantial impact on Qualcomm, Apple, and MediaTek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Ming-chi Kuo indicated that Qualcomm sells tens of millions of chips for Huawei phones, sales now likely to be replaced by the new Kirin 9000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This shift means every non-Chinese semiconductor maker and Apple stands to lose business to this new domestic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

SMIC is expected to be busy fulfilling Huawei orders for the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. They are also anticipated to seek new N+2 node customers in high-powered computing, potentially partnering to create a domestic [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI accelerator]]—a Chinese version of the Nvidia A100 or TPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. A Chinese 7-nanometer [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI accelerator]] is expected within 1-2 years, possibly designed by Biren, Baidu, Alibaba Cloud, or Tencent, barring further sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## What China Does Next

China is actively building its native [[developments_in_chinas_domestic_semiconductor_ecosystem | semiconductor and technology ecosystem]], a real achievement given the impact of sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. From a semiconductor manufacturing standpoint, the primary goal should be widespread distribution of this phone to maximize scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Selling millions more units not only to Chinese consumers but also to Europeans, Australians, Southeast Asians, and Latin Americans is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Although Huawei phones do not natively support Google products, Huawei has engaged in influencer marketing to guide users on how to install them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Every export sale weakens Western phone makers and strengthens SMIC, allowing them to raise yields, achieve profitability, and fund the transition to 5-nanometer production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

SMIC should also begin reviewing and replicating advanced packaging technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. While phone chips prioritize thinness and heat management (using Chip Scale Packaging), advanced [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI]] applications require technologies like chiplets and 2.5D die-stacking to manage data bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

The Chinese Government will also need to strengthen its domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment ecosystem, aiming to replace foreign suppliers like ASML, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, and Lam Research, as foreign equipment may contain "kill switches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## What America Does Next

Jordan Schneider, a US-China tech relations expert from ChinaTalk, provided insights on the US response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security justified its October 7th restrictions by citing the impact of advanced computing ICs (logic ICs at 16/14nm or below) and manufacturing equipment on military modernization and human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This means the US government believes China's ability to manufacture advanced logic chips has significant implications for regional military balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Given the [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | progress SMIC and Huawei have made]], if the US government views a Chinese 7-nanometer node as a national security threat, they may intensify efforts to stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. This requires a better understanding of which semiconductor manufacturing equipment is still entering China, as SMIC still depends on foreign equipment for this node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Domestic suppliers remain years behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

Currently, equipment companies like Applied, Lam Research, Tokyo Electron, and KLA can sell most of their tools (for deposition, etch, metrology, epitaxy, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. These tools, usable for 7nm and even 5nm, are ostensibly sold to SMIC for lagging-edge nodes but are almost certainly being repurposed for chips like the Kirin 9000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

To prevent China from developing leading-edge capacity at scale, the US government, in cooperation with allies like Japan, the Netherlands, and Germany, should consider tighter export controls targeting repurposable tools such as Argon Fluoride Immersion lithography, mask, and CMP equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. They should also implement far less liberal use of licenses for firms like SMIC, which are on the entity list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Kirin 9000s represents a significant moment in technology history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. It is akin to Samsung's achievement in 1986 when its 1-megabit DRAM chip narrowed the Korean-Japanese semiconductor gap from five years to one, followed by its 4-megabit chip in 1988, achieving parity and contributing to Japan's decline in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. The People's Republic of China is adopting a similar approach to semiconductor manufacturing, which proved successful for South Korea and appears to be working for China as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

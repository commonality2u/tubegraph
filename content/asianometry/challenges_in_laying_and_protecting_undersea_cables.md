Undersea cables are the unheralded backbones of global communications networks, carrying gigabits of information around the globe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Much of the hyper-connected, high-tech world relies on these seemingly low-tech cables, which navigate a dangerous environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Beginnings and Early Protection Challenges
The idea of leaving an unexposed copper cable at the bottom of the harsh sea initially seemed unwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The first underwater experiments occurred in 1811 when German polymath Samuel Thomas von SÃ¶mmerring attempted to cross a river with a telegraph cable wrapped in rubber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This failed because rubber, a water-absorbent vegetable protein, allowed water to reach the copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

A few years later, in 1838, Irish physician and telegraph pioneer Dr. William Brooke O'Shaughnessy developed a new method to prevent water leakage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He wrapped wire in rattan, a palm material, and then again with tar-covered yarn, successfully sealing the cable from river water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

In 1845, the Brett Brothers proposed laying a telegraph cable from Dover, England, to Calais, France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. They insulated a half-inch thick telegraph cable with gutta percha, an inert organic plastic from Malaysia, and laid it in 1850 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The cable, unprotected and only weighed down by a few lead bricks, performed poorly 54 meters under the sea, carrying only a few distorted signals before failing the next morning, reportedly cut by a French fisherman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

For their next attempt, railway engineer Thomas Russell Crampton devised a new scheme in 1851, wrapping the cable in steel wire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This design performed well for years and has been generally followed by virtually every submarine cable since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The core consists of one or several copper wires wrapped in gutta percha insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable, laid in 1866, used three layers of gutta percha insulation for its entire 2,500-mile length, consuming over 300 tons of the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Gutta percha was eventually replaced by polyethylene plastic in the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## [[Technological advancements in cable design | Modern Cable Design and Variants]]
Modern cables generally follow Crampton's model, with a core, cushioning layer, and armoring steel wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. To deter bacteria in tropical waters from consuming gutta percha, early cable makers sometimes applied powdered silica or brass tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

As communication technologies evolved, so did the cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Telegraph cables were replaced by telephone cables, which benefited from repeaters in the 1940s to boost and improve signal quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The 1980s saw the introduction of optic fiber, vastly increasing data bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Tweaks accommodate these changes and differing environments, leading to several cable variants:

*   **Lightweight Cables**: The industry workhorse, featuring only steel wires and polyethylene. These are suited for shallow, safe, and stable waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Lightweight Protective Cables**: Add more polyethylene and steel tape layers, primarily to combat animals and chafing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Single-Armored Cables**: A lightweight cable with an additional single layer of steel wire and polyethylene wrapping, providing extra strength when cable-cutting risks are higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Double-Armored Cables**: Two armoring layers of galvanized steel wires wound around the exterior of a standard lightweight cable. These are deployed in shallow waters with high traffic where cables cannot be buried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## [[Subsea cable laying and its technical challenges | Laying Undersea Cables]]
[[Subsea cable laying and its technical challenges | Undersea cables]] are typically laid from a boat that carries thousands of tons of cable in a "cable tank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The cable moves from the tank through a "cable highway" of rollers to the Linear Cable Engine, which performs the actual laying or retrieval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

The cable is subjected to intense tensions during this process, requiring ship operators to continuously check its quality and integrity, sometimes by powering it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. For long cables, repeater stations must be added every 60 to 80 kilometers to amplify and restore the signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Another delicate process is "jointing," which involves attaching one piece of cable to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This requires preparing and splicing the cable ends, then re-encapsulating them in polyethylene and armor to achieve 90% of the original strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## [[Natural and environmental hazards to undersea cables | Environmental Hazards]]
[[Natural and environmental hazards to undersea cables | Subsea cables]] face a variety of natural, animal, and human hazards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Chafing and Corrosion
A significant long-term natural hazard is chafing and corrosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Currents and waves can chafe the cable's exterior by rubbing it against rocks and gravel, removing protective layers and exposing its interior to the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Corrosion can be induced by biological creatures; barnacles, shells, or sponges can cover and foul cables in shallower waters, while kelp and corals do the same in deeper waters, sometimes encasing the entire cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Landslides and Earthquakes
Underwater landslides are a major threat, causing fast-moving, dense "turbidity currents" of water and sediment that rush at speeds up to 45 miles an hour, easily cutting anything in their path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Landslides have plagued cables since the 1880s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

A classic example is the Grand Banks Earthquake of 1929, a magnitude 7.2 earthquake off Canada's coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. An hour later, a massive underwater landslide, involving over 175 cubic kilometers of sand and sediment, cut eleven cables and is now the textbook example of underwater landslide hazards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. In 2006, two magnitude 7.0 earthquakes off Taiwan's southwest coast triggered landslides that broke multiple cables, affecting communications in Taiwan and Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

Landslides are particularly problematic in delta areas where rivers, especially after typhoons, dump large amounts of silt, biological material, and dirt into the ocean, forming loosely consolidated "slumps" that break cables when they move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Earthquakes themselves can also damage cables directly, as seismic movements cause the seafloor to slide and reposition, breaking any traversing cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The Grand Banks Earthquake alone cut 12 cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## [[Natural and environmental hazards to undersea cables | Animal Hazards]]
Animals, primarily whales and sharks, can break cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Whales swimming deep for food can become entangled in cables, theorized to happen when their lower jaw catches a loose cable, leading to further entanglement and drowning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Sharks biting cables, though rarer now, can also cause damage, which proper reinforcement helps solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## [[Humanrelated threats and protections for undersea cables | Human-Related Threats]]

### Fishermen and Shipping
Two-thirds of all cable breaks in depths under 200 meters are caused by human activity, specifically ship anchors and fishing nets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Anchors**: When a boat drops or retrieves an anchor, it drags along the seafloor. If it hits and slides along a cable, it can cut the external armor and internal core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Nets**:
    *   **Otter-trawl nets**: Large cone-shaped nets towed for bottom fish, using 1-ton hardwood "otterboards" to keep the mouth open. These boards can snag and damage unburied cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
    *   **Beam trawls**: Cone-shaped nets with a bag, about 10 meters wide and weighing 4-5 tons. Their bottom sliders or shoes scrape the ocean floor, cutting exposed cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. While newer "wing gear" designs float over the seabed, they can still slice insulation, exposing the cable to elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

The 1884 Cable Convention, a key international law, obliges fishermen whose equipment gets caught in a cable to sacrifice it and report the incident to the cable owner, in return for an indemnity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. To mitigate these hazards, undersea cable operators often dig trenches for their cables or apply double armor in waters less than 1,500 meters deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Beyond this depth, anchors are less significant, and cables are often left on the ocean floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### Sabotage
While most cable breaks are accidental, intentional cuts do occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Theft**: Cables are sometimes cut for financial gain, particularly for their copper content. Notable incidents include two vessels removing 79 and 98 kilometers of cable from Southeast Asian networks in March 2007, damaging Vietnam's internet for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Similar events have happened in Jamaica, Indonesia, and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Laws governing cable cuts outside a country's 200-mile exclusive economic zone are murky, often resulting in low fines or no punishment for perpetrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Asymmetrical Warfare**: Cable cutting or control strategies are a critical focus in war planning due to their ability to interrupt communications for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. During World War I, British control of the subsea cable network cut off the Central Powers from their overseas possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. In World War II, this forced Axis powers to communicate via encrypted radio, enabling interception and decryption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Recent reports of cable cuts in the Red Sea have affected internet speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The ease of cutting a subsea cable (e.g., by dropping and dragging an anchor) combined with high repair costs makes it an effective tactic for asymmetrical warfare, easy to execute and deny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

## [[Humanrelated threats and protections for undersea cables | Protection Strategies]]
The most effective way to protect a cable is to dig a deep trench, lay the cable, and cover it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Since excavation equipment cannot be used underwater, this is primarily achieved using high-pressure water jets or specialized underwater trenching machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

The depth of burial depends on conditions, with a general rule of thumb being no more than 2 meters, though softer seabeds may require deeper burial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. In the late 1990s, fiber optic operators used a "Burial Protection Index" to gauge depth, but it is now considered outdated, with integrators relying on their own risk assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

When the ground is too hard for trenching, alternatives exist:
*   **Riprap (rock armor)**: Smaller rocks are laid on top of the cable, followed by larger rocks. This method is most effective in calm water currents where the rocks remain undisturbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Cover plates or casing pipes**: Shells can encase the cable, with additional protections like riprap layered on top if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

While engineering for protecting cables from natural hazards is robust, a determined attacker can still easily cut a cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Thus, protection largely relies on security through obscuration, depth, and physical barriers like trenches and riprap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Despite the growth of satellite services like SpaceX's StarLink, undersea cables continue to carry the majority of the world's internet and telephone traffic, making their protection critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

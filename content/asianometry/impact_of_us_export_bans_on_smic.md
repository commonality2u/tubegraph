Recent reports from TechInsights and SemiAnalysis indicate that SMIC, China's national semiconductor champion, has begun producing chips using its own 7-nanometer (N+2) process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This development has sparked considerable discussion regarding the [[impact_of_export_bans_on_chinese_lithography_industry | impact of export bans on Chinese lithography industry]] and the broader implications for SMIC's market position.

## SMIC's 7-nanometer N+2 Node

The term "7-nanometer" is primarily a marketing device, used to convey a better chip in terms of power, performance, or area, rather than corresponding to a physical dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. It signifies a generational improvement, indicating chips that are approximately 70% better than the preceding 10-nanometer generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

SMIC's N+2 node is an advancement from its N+1 process, which was first "taped out" in October 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Both N+1 and N+2 utilize DUV (Deep Ultraviolet) immersion lithography with multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. While SMIC's N+2 is technically capable of using EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) technology, the United States has imposed an export ban on EUV devices, blocking this potential path for SMIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

SemiAnalysis, through TechInsights, notes that SMIC's N+2 process is "99% the same" as TSMC's N7 node, particularly in the physical measurements and placement of transistors (finfets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. TSMC began shipping N7 chips in high volume in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, placing SMIC about four to six years behind the leading edge in high-volume N7 equivalent production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. N+2 is considered one of the most advanced processes available from any foundry to its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Economic Competitiveness without EUV

Despite its technical capability, the economic competitiveness of SMIC's N+2 node without EUV is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. While it's possible to fabricate chips at nodes even more advanced than N7 using 193-nanometer immersion technology and multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> (Dr. Burn Lin, the "father of 193-nanometer immersion lithography," stated SMIC could fab N5-equivalent chips with multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>), the key issue is achieving meaningful production yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Foundries like Samsung and Intel have famously struggled with yield optimization on advanced nodes without EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. However, given that N+2 is very similar to TSMC's N7 node, which TSMC ramped up without significant reported trouble, SMIC is expected to follow a similar yield optimization curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

In today's market, a foundry with EUV capabilities has significant economic advantages over those relying solely on DUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. An N7 equivalent node using only multi-patterning imposes manufacturing limitations that restrict chip designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. In an open market, SMIC's N+2 would likely not be economically viable, as better-performing N7-equivalent options like TSMC's N6 (an EUV-equipped evolution of their N7) exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_on_tsmc_and_samsung | impact on TSMC and Samsung]] as competitors.

## Trade Secrets and Market Positioning

SMIC's N+2 node's close resemblance to TSMC's N7 raises concerns about potential intrusion on trade secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. TSMC previously succeeded in court in 2002 and 2006, securing import bans on SMIC products in the United States that were made with TSMC trade secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. If TSMC pursues similar action, it could eliminate N+2's viability as an export product, limiting its use to domestic Chinese products or exports to friendly countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

While SMIC has historically valued its export capabilities to countries like the United States, it may no longer be dependent on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Driving Domestic Demand and Strategic Leadership

The Chinese chip design industry has matured significantly since the mid-2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. HiSilicon, Huawei's chip design arm and formerly China's largest semiconductor company, would likely be eager to use N+2 to produce high-performing mobile processors for its phones and server chips for its cloud services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. HiSilicon, a former flagship customer of TSMC for its N7-based Kirin chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>, is familiar with this technology.

This potential partnership between HiSilicon/Huawei and SMIC could bring significant volume, which is crucial for foundries to scale and yield-optimize their process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This aligns with the [[future_prospects_for_huawei_and_smic_in_technology_ecosystem | future prospects for Huawei and SMIC in technology ecosystem]]. If substantial volumes are achieved, N+2 is expected to improve over time, mirroring TSMC's experience with N7 before EUV became prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

China has consistently made leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing a high policy priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. A key figure in SMIC's recent advancements is Co-CEO Liang Bong-song, a TSMC alumnus known for his technical brilliance and relentless pursuit of the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Upon joining SMIC in 2017, he reoriented the company from a second-source manufacturer to a leading-edge innovator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## Expanded Export Bans and Their Effects

Access to the latest lithography technologies is vital for SMIC's progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The US government has been pressuring the Netherlands' ASML and Japan's Nikon to prevent the export of their immersion DUV lithography machines to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. The timing of this push, coinciding with SMIC's N+2 shipment, is likely not coincidental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. The US has long blocked the sale of advanced EUV machines to China, and expanding the ban to immersion lithography represents a further step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

Immersion machines enhance the resolution of older 193-nanometer ARF (Argon Fluoride) laser technology by using water and other fluids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. They are mature "workhorses" of modern semiconductor manufacturing, with prototypes emerging in 2003, and ASML and Nikon being the only current suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. While 193-nanometer "dry" ARF machines can be modified into immersion lithography machines, this process requires substantial technical effort and expertise, potentially taking less than five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:10:00]</a>. An N7 equivalent node requires more sophisticated immersion technologies, adding to the timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

As of the video's creation, Japan and the Netherlands had not finalized any ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. China has responded with strong objections, viewing such actions as unfair given the principles of free markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. However, governments globally protect their nationally important industries, just as Europe protects automobiles and China protects telecom and internet sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. The US has a long history of protecting its computing technology industries with export control agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### Effectiveness and Outlook

The effectiveness of export bans has been debated for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. An export ban on 193-nanometer immersion lithography technology, without a corresponding ban on dry ARF technology (which seems unfeasible), is estimated to add four to six years to SMIC's progress toward the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

However, such a ban is also likely to spur significant investment in Chinese-made lithography, initially focusing on maintaining existing immersion equipment and then facilitating the dry-to-immersion transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. While it's debatable whether Chinese companies can eventually produce complete lithography systems on par with ASML or Nikon, the gap is large but not insurmountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

SMIC's achievement of a legitimate 7-nanometer node at high volume and good yield is a significant triumph for China's advanced manufacturing industry, making it one of only three companies globally to reach this level of scale and sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This success represents a key aspect of the [[implications_of_chinese_semiconductor_advancements | implications of Chinese semiconductor advancements]].

For the United States, any successful immersion ban would not be a permanently damaging blow to China; it would primarily maintain and slightly expand the Sino-American semiconductor gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This policy is seen as buying time, which the US administration highly values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. The situation draws parallels to the American response to the Japanese semiconductor challenge over 30 years ago, where government intervention bought time for the US industry to adapt, build new markets, improve manufacturing, and adopt innovative suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. The lesson for the American semiconductor industry is to use this time to improve and innovate rather than solely relying on government intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This also relates to broader discussions around [[government_subsidies_and_their_effects_on_the_semiconductor_industry | government subsidies and their effects on the semiconductor industry]].

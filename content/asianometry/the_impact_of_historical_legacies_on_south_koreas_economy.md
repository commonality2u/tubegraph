[[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | South Korea's]] greatest economic strength is also a significant weakness: its economy is defined by massive business groups like Samsung, Hyundai, and LG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These groups drive the export economy and influence daily life, but they also manipulate the economy for their own benefit and maintain [[corruption_and_political_ties_in_south_korea | corrupt ties]] with high levels of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Legacy of Colonialism and Early Republic

[[corruption_and_political_ties_in_south_korea | Corruption]] in Korea existed before the modern state, with the Japanese colonial state and its agricultural economy being quite [[social_inequality_and_the_role_of_big_business_in_south_korea | corrupt and unequal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Large landlords exploited farmers and earned all the income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While the Japanese administration ended with World War II, many of its legacies transferred to the new South Korean government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Syngman Rhee, South Korea's first president, was a staunch anti-communist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He committed massacres against suspected communists, leading to approximately 100,000 deaths, including the Bodo League massacre in 1950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Rhee also played a key role in creating the *chaebol* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. To fund the Korean War, his government sold off assets seized from the old Japanese state and other state-owned entities starting in 1946 and peaking in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The prices for these privatizations were determined by private negotiation rather than public auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Purchasers of these assets, such as Tong Yang Beer (now Oriental Breweries), Daehan Textile, and Tong Yang Cement, eventually became the *chaebol*, similar to Japan's *zaibatsu* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## The Park Chung-hee Era: Crony Capitalism and Industrialization

In 1961, Park Chung-hee led a military coup that ended the Second Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Initially, Park arrested *chaebol* heads for corrupt wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. However, his government quickly negotiated a crony capitalism deal with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Park sought to emulate Japan's industrialization and needed the companies' assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Under this arrangement:
*   The *chaebol* supported Park's policies for import substitution and later exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   The Korean government provided *chaebol* with foreign currency loans at below-market interest rates to acquire foreign technologies and build capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   The *chaebol* contributed funds to Park's presidential election campaigns, often in the form of 10-15% loan commissions (kickbacks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

This created a system where companies learned that the best way to acquire cheap capital and wealth was through close ties with the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. For example, Park Chung-hee maintained close personal ties with Chung Ju-yung of Hyundai and Kim Woo-jong of Daewoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Kickbacks to the government increased significantly over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

For two decades, the government and the *chaebol* largely controlled Korean society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Companies funded political campaigns and helped grow the economy, while the government granted privileges to *chaebol* and shifted their financial burdens onto society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. An example of this was the 1971 bailout where the government converted private market loans of over-leveraged *chaebol* into five-year public ones and froze private interest rates, harming small lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Chaebol Dominance and Societal Impact

By the mid-1980s, the balance of power shifted decisively in favor of the *chaebol* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The top five *chaebol* accounted for nearly 20% of the country's GDP and 45% of its mining and manufacturing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The top ten *chaebol* owned an average of 8.6 manufacturing businesses, totaling 20 to 40 businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

South Korea's *chaebol*-centric strategy suffocated its small and medium-sized business sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. From 1966 to 1976, the number of manufacturing firms grew only 10%, but their size exploded by 176% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. In contrast, Taiwan, which pursued a less cozy state-business relationship, saw its manufacturing firms grow by 150% in number and 29% in size during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

This imbalance began to cause [[social_inequality_and_the_role_of_big_business_in_south_korea | social inequality]] and public disapproval of the *chaebol*'s outsized power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. As Koreans became richer, they desired more than just higher wages; they sought better environmental regulations, working conditions, and a better life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The increasingly democratic government had to shift from support to regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Democratization and Continued Corruption

Despite the shift towards democracy, government leaders still relied on *chaebol* financial contributions to stay in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. During Chun Doo-hwan's administration, *chaebol* contributed 15 to 22 billion won to high-level political campaigns, and 21 to 25 billion won during Roh Tae-woo's subsequent administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

This [[corruption_and_political_ties_in_south_korea | corrupt deal]] persisted due to the weakness of Korea's political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. During the military dictatorship, parties were mere shells for their candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. When the country democratized in 1987, holding free elections, there was no time to establish suitable campaigning norms or an above-board financing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This cash starvation made parties vulnerable to [[corruption_and_political_ties_in_south_korea | corruption]], allowing *chaebol* to secure government aid, plentiful capital, favorable regulations, and protection from competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## The Asian Financial Crisis and Its Aftermath

The Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 exposed the consequences of Korea's inability to control its big businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. In the decade after 1987, the *chaebol* gained substantial political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. For example, in 1988, Daewoo Group influenced the National Assembly to amend the law to bail out its ailing shipbuilding corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. They also used this power to push for rapid liberalization reforms that aided their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

Key reforms included:
*   **Easier access to foreign capital:** Allowing *chaebol* to take out cheap foreign currency loans, which led to a massive debt boom culminating in the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Limited ownership in non-bank financial companies:** This encouraged complex cross-ownership structures that obscured their true size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. For instance, the Lee family, controlling Samsung Group, could exercise operating control over most affiliated companies with only a minority share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This complexity meant no one knew which subsidiaries were profitable, leading profitable companies to prop up weak ones, creating market inefficiencies and oversupply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The 1997 crisis significantly curtailed the *chaebol*'s power, opening the door for [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | reforms]] aimed at promoting a "common prosperity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun administrations imposed various [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | reforms]] to prevent future financial crises by limiting debt capacity and cross-shareholder structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

These [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | reforms]] had wide-ranging consequences:
*   Companies like Hanjin Shipping had to reduce debt-to-equity ratios below 200%, forcing them to sell ships and lease others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This is detailed in the video about [[south_koreas_economic_strategies_for_shipping_industry | Hanjin Shipping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   The Korean car industry consolidated, with only Hyundai remaining from five independent companies in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   *Chaebol* reduced and separated their affiliates; a sample showed 819 affiliates in 1997, dropping to 544 three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   Dividends to minority shareholders increased from 2.2 trillion won in 2001 to 10.8 trillion by 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

The crisis also spurred the creation of the Korean export juggernaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Faced with an "unfriendly domestic environment," the largest *chaebol* capitalized on free trade agreements in the 2000s and turned outwards, becoming highly successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. By 2013, 86% of Samsung's revenue came from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This success drove the Korean economy's recovery, growing at an average rate of 5% from 1998 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## Economic Growth and Growing Inequality

Despite strong GDP growth, this period hid troubling [[social_inequality_and_the_role_of_big_business_in_south_korea | social issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. The benefits of growth primarily went to a small group, creating a significant gap between the "haves" and "have-nots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. In 2013, *chaebol* generated over 50% of revenue and value-add in manufacturing but employed less than 20% of the sector's employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

As part of the post-1997 [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | reform]] negotiations, the government agreed to make it easier for *chaebol* to lay off workers, leading to hundreds of thousands losing their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Many have since struggled to find regular salaried work, contributing to elder poverty in Korea reaching four times the OECD average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. The income share for the top 1% of Korean society rose from 7% before 1997 to 12% in the mid-2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This perceived inequality led Koreans to vote for change in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## Political Responses and Continued Challenges

President Lee Myung-bak, a conservative and former Hyundai Construction CEO, emphasized economic recovery in his 2007 campaign, promising to raise GDP growth to 7%, achieve a per capita income of $40,000, and make Korea the seventh-largest economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. His win with the highest margin in years was tempered by record low voter participation, indicating public skepticism about the government's ability to address [[social_inequality_and_the_role_of_big_business_in_south_korea | social inequalities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

Lee's policies aimed to empower *chaebol* to compete globally, viewing them as "too small for the world" rather than "too big for Korea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. He lowered the corporate tax rate from 25% to 20%, raised the ceiling on non-bank financial investment, and amnestied executives convicted after the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. He also continued market-oriented [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | reforms]] that gave more decision-making power to the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

However, unlike Park Chung-hee, Lee did not force *chaebol* to invest profits into new and risky industries like quantum computing or fusion energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Instead, money was funneled into traditional industries like construction and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. Ultimately, the Lee administration could not deliver the promised growth, and GDP growth continued to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Lee was arrested in 2018 on charges of bribery, embezzlement, and tax fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

In the 2012 presidential election, Park Geun-hye moved leftwards in her messaging, combining nostalgia for the "glory years" with an emphasis on welfare, though she did not advocate for a higher capital gains tax, which was key to the accelerating wealth gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

## Consequences of Regulatory Capture: The Sewol Sinking

[[corruption_and_political_ties_in_south_korea | Modern corruption]] by *chaebol* aims to maximize wealth and market power, particularly through tax manipulations and [[political_and_financial_environment_in_south_korea | legislation and regulatory capture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

A stark example of the consequences of regulatory capture is the 2014 Sewol sinking, which claimed 304 lives, mostly high school students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. The ferry was old, converted for passenger use, and heavily overloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. The most direct cause of the high death rate was that safety and rescue regulations had been ignored for a significant period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. The regulatory agency and the ferry company had a close working relationship, ignoring violations to maintain a profitable status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. This included the rotation of government employees into the industry and the ferry company's monopoly privilege on the lucrative Incheon-Jeju route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

## Current State and Future Debates

South Korea's struggle with its largest companies persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. President Park Geun-hye's administration ended in corruption scandals and impeachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Her successor, President Moon Jae-in, responded with business [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | reforms]] and higher tax rates, which seemed to improve public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

However, the South Korean economy is highly dependent on a few powerful global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Substantial [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | reform]] could weaken their global standing against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. As South Korean democratic society becomes increasingly polarized, the issue of *chaebol* [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | reform]] continues to be a central debate in presidential politics, alongside concerns about North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

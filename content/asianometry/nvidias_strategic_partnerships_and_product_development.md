In 1995, over 30 companies were competing to build graphics chips for personal computers, a number that consolidated to just three six years later, with [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] clearly in the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Jensen Huang served as the company's president and CEO, while Malachowsky and Priem handled the technical aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The company's core mission was to create microprocessors capable of rendering high-quality 3D graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Their name, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]], is derived from the Latin word meaning "envy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Early Market Context and Demand for Graphics

The concept of dedicated hardware for 3D graphics processing predates [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]], with early examples like Atari video game consoles in the 1970s having graphics chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Commercial video cards, which plug into the main computer, emerged in the 1980s, exemplified by the IBM Professional Graphics Controller (PGA) in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Though expensive and limited to IBM PCs, the PGA's use of an onboard Intel AD88 microprocessor to offload video tasks from the main CPU solidified the idea of a dedicated video card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

In the late 1980s, Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) became a dominant force in graphics, refining the concept of a "graphics pipeline" and releasing OpenGL in 1992, a public 3D graphics API that became widely adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. While SGI hardware excelled in the workstation space, they did not seriously pursue the consumer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Consumer interest in graphics exploded with the release of Microsoft Windows 3.1 in 1990, featuring a graphical user interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This interest escalated dramatically in 1993 with id Software's 3D game *Doom*, and even more so with its 1996 follow-up, *Quake*, which offered full real-time 3D rendering and online multiplayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. *Quake*'s demand for high performance, often unmet by contemporary PCs, led to programmer John Carmack rewriting the game to support OpenGL, creating *GLQuake* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This spurred innovation in consumer video cards, leading to the rise of 3dfx, which launched the Voodoo video card, becoming the first consumer card capable of running *GLQuake* well and quickly dominating the 3D acceleration market with 80% share at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s Initial Steps and the NV1 Flop

During this competitive period, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] was just starting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Two venture capital firms invested $1.25 million each, totaling $2.5 million, providing [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] with crucial early funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Jensen Huang then secured three vital partnerships:

1.  **Manufacturing with SGS-Thomson Microelectronics**: In 1994, a year after its founding, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] partnered with SGS-Thomson (now STMicroelectronics) for chip manufacturing, allowing [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] to focus solely on design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
2.  **Board Integration with Diamond Multimedia Systems**: Diamond Multimedia agreed to incorporate [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s chips into their multimedia accelerator boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
3.  **Gaming Porting with Sega**: Sega, a popular video game company, chose [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] to help port their arcade and console games to PCs, critically allowing [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] to leverage their brand name for the launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

These partnerships led to [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s first product, the NV1, released in May 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The NV1 was a multimedia PCI card combining graphics, sound, and Sega gamepad support, aiming to converge multiple multimedia functions into one "sound blaster of multimedia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. However, the NV1's ambition to do too much resulted in compromises, and it was not compatible with leading graphics APIs like OpenGL or 3dfx's Glide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The NV1 flopped, and [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] stopped selling it in late 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. A planned advanced NV1 (NV2) for Sega's next console also fell through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Strategic Pivot: Embracing Microsoft and Vertical Integration

Despite the NV1's failure, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s ability to ship a technically impressive product allowed Jensen Huang to raise another $6.5 million in funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Learning from their mistakes, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s leadership made a fundamental shift, betting on three key rising trends:

1.  **Microsoft Direct3D**: Microsoft quickly recognized the growing demand for 3D PC games and, in 1996, acquired RenderMorphicsto create their own 3D graphics API, Direct3D, as part of the larger DirectX bundle built into Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. While Direct3D initially faced criticism from figures like John Carmack, Microsoft vowed future improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] bet its future on Direct3D's tight integration with Windows making it the dominant 3D graphics API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
2.  **Vertical Integration of Device Drivers**: Historically, device drivers were written by board partners, leading to mismatched incentives and often sub-optimal performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] chose to take driver development in-house, aligning incentives and allowing them to produce high-performing drivers responsive to issues across all board partners. This became a critical advantage and a cornerstone of their future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## Product Success: The RIVA 128

With this new direction, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] launched its second major product, the RIVA 128, in 1997, at a time when the company had less than six weeks of cash left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. The RIVA 128 was specifically designed to accelerate Direct3D and, critically, supported both 3D and 2D graphics, a functionality that market leader 3dfx's Voodoo cards lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. The RIVA 128 sold well, notably as the Diamond Viper 330, retailing for about $140 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## The Manufacturing Partnership: TSMC and Moore's Law

To maintain its relentless pace and win the market, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] made its third big bet: outsourcing manufacturing and leveraging Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. In 1998, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] ended its partnership with SGS-Thomson and partnered with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Unlike SGS-Thomson, TSMC pledged never to compete with its partners, aligning their success with [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. This partnership allowed [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] to focus entirely on design, optimizing for speed and rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

[[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] organized its design teams into three groups—one for the upcoming design, one for a refresh of the last year's design, and one for the next year's design—and adopted advanced computer-aided design (CAD) verification and validation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. This resulted in a relentless six-month product cycle, with [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] delivering a new chip generation every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This brutal pace drove many competitors out of the graphics card industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

## Market Consolidation and Competitors' Fails

### 3dfx's Misstep
Going into 1998, 3dfx held the market lead, but its Voodoo cards only offered 3D acceleration, lacking 2D support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. While their Voodoo 2 sold well, 3dfx made a critical error in December 1998 by acquiring boardmaker STB for $141 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. They announced that their chips would only be available in their own brand-name boards, directly competing with their former customers who then defected to [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. 3dfx's inexperience in manufacturing and STB's Mexican facilities could not compete with Asian competitors, leading to a cash burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. 3dfx eventually dissolved and sold its assets to [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

### Intel's Attempt
Intel, aiming to dominate the 3D graphics space, released the Intel 740 card in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. However, it failed due to its reliance on the then-unpopular AGP port and real-world performance lagging behind speed tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. Intel's slower CPU development cycle (one to two years) couldn't keep pace with the rapid graphics market, and the i740 was quickly discontinued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. While Intel continued in the integrated graphics processor (IGP) space, leveraging its CPU monopoly to gain market share in low-end, low-margin segments, this effectively wiped out that market for other competitors, leaving them caught in the middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>.

By the early 2000s, the graphics card market had consolidated from over 30 companies to just three: [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] and ATI forming a duopoly in the high-end, with Intel dominating the low-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. ATI was later acquired by AMD in 2006 for $5.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

## Beyond Graphics: The General Processing Unit

[[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]]'s strategic choice to vertically integrate into device drivers, an adjacent expansion that added significant business value, proved to be a lasting competitive edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. In contrast, 3dfx's move into board manufacturing destroyed value, burned cash, and alienated customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

Since its rise in the graphics card industry, [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] has looked beyond just providing graphics chipsets. In 1999, they coined the phrase "[[nvidias_innovation_with_general_processing_unit_concept | General Processing Unit]]" or GPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] began popularizing the concept of [[nvidias_innovation_with_general_processing_unit_concept | general purpose computing]], envisioning new applications for GPUs beyond video game graphics, a vision that would come to fruition in the years that followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

The [[Economic history of the Soviet Union | Soviet Union]]'s oil production became a cornerstone of its economy and a significant factor in its geopolitical standing, especially with the development of the West Siberian Basin. However, this focus on energy also had profound [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | economic]] and environmental consequences, ultimately contributing to the nation's eventual dissolution.

## Rise as an Energy Superpower
In 1979, the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union]] was the world's leading oil producer, pumping 11.5 million barrels daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. By the end of the 1960s, it ranked as the second-largest oil-producing nation globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This rise was largely due to the vast, untapped oil and natural gas reserves hidden beneath the frozen swamps and lakes of Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### West Siberian Basin Development
The West Siberian Basin, located approximately 600 miles east of the Ural Mountains, is an immense, flat area covering 3.4 million square kilometers, nearly five times the size of Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. About a third of this area is potentially oil-bearing, a region larger than Texas and Oklahoma combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The region is characterized by short summers, long and severe winters with temperatures plunging to -27 degrees Celsius, and 60-70% of the area consisting of swamps and lakes that freeze solid for 9 to 10 months a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This made the area sparsely populated and challenging to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Beneath this harsh landscape lie some of the world's largest oil and gas deposits, second only to those in the Persian Gulf, including the Uren gas field and Russia's largest oil field, Samotlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

While Soviet geologists predicted significant deposits in West Siberia as far back as the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, initial governmental reluctance to develop the fields was due to uncertainty about the reserves and the immense investment required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. However, the rapid decline of the Volga-Ural oil fields in the mid-to-late 1960s, which fell by 261 million tons between 1971 and 1975 instead of the planned 150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, forced a change in strategy.

Given that oil exports were the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | country's biggest source of foreign currency]] (over 50%) for purchasing essential goods like wheat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, and due to [[soviet_energy_trade_relationships_with_eastern_bloc_and_western_europe | long-term oil export obligations to Eastern Bloc countries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, the [[Soviet Union]] urgently prioritized West Siberian development. Premier Alexei Kosygin visited the Tyumen region in 1968, and in 1971, Leonid Brezhnev himself pushed for its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. A new ministry was founded to build oil infrastructure, led by Boris Shcherbina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

Developing West Siberia meant creating entire towns from nothing and bringing in hundreds of thousands of geologists, builders, and work crews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. To attract workers, salaries were 2.2 to 2.5 times higher than elsewhere, and promotion was easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Most workers were young, under 35, seeking to earn money quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Economic Impacts
The investment in West Siberia quickly paid off:
*   **1965:** 5.6 million tons of oil and 1.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **1970:** 31 million tons of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **1975:** 141 million tons of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **1977:** 211 million tons of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   By 1973, 113 oil fields were discovered, including several supergiant fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

The Soviets constructed extensive gas pipelines, such as the "Druzba" (Friendship) and "Bratstvo" (Brotherhood) networks, to transport products to buyers in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. From 1970-1979, the [[Soviet Union]] laid 1,400 kilometers of pipeline annually, at rates 3 to 5 times faster and at a third of the cost per kilometer compared to Western methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Trade Relationships
The [[rise of the Soviet Union as an energy superpower | Soviet Union's energy dominance]] found receptive markets in Western Europe, which sought to diversify away from Arab oil after conflicts in the 1950s and 60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **Austria:** First Western European country to deal with the Soviets for oil in 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Italy:** 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **West Germany:** 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Despite domestic controversy over political issues like Berlin's division, West Germany needed gas as its coal mines declined, and gas demand soared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. The decision to accept Soviet gas, keeping its share under 20%, contributed to the Four Power Agreement of 1971, which saw West and East Germany de facto recognize each other's sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **France:** 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **United States:** In 1972, the U.S. and the [[Soviet Union]] agreed on a potential "North Star" energy deal for liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipments to the American West Coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. However, this deal was eventually called off in 1974 due to Congressional opposition over Most Favored Nation status and credit guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

The oil crises of the 1970s, including the Iranian Revolution, further accelerated these [[soviet_energy_trade_relationships_with_eastern_bloc_and_western_europe | economic exchanges between the Soviets and Western Europe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

### Eastern Bloc Obligations
[[postwar_soviet_oil_expansion_and_political_influence | Soviet oil and energy exports]] were crucial for maintaining the cohesion of the Eastern Bloc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) facilitated trade where the Soviets supplied raw goods, and satellites sent back manufactured goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. These oil deliveries were made on "brotherly terms" at prices far below Western market rates, without passing on increased extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. While economically unfavorable to the Soviets, these imports were essential for countries like East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, which depended on them for energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

## Environmental Impacts
While economically successful, Soviet pipeline construction and oil extraction had severe environmental consequences. The speed of construction was achieved by completely disregarding ecological concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This resulted in:
*   Waste water pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   Torn up swathes of taiga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   Hundreds of abandoned drilled wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
The [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet system's]] emphasis on fulfilling economic plans meant that environmental sustainability was ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Decline and Stagnation
Despite high expectations, West Siberia's oil production growth rates rapidly declined, from 23.8% in 1976 to 7% in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. The [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union's]] overall oil production growth rate fell from 9.1% annually in the 1960s to just 6.2% between 1971 and 1978, and under 1% by 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

Without access to more advanced oil drills and pumps from the West, the Soviets resorted to drilling more exploratory wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. The annual amount of drilling doubled from 13 million meters in 1977 to over 26 million in 1984, with 16 million meters of new drilling in West Siberia alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This meant deeper, more complicated, and more expensive drilling, yet by 1984, Soviet oil output fell into negative growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

This led to a cycle where the Soviet energy industry, and eventually the entire [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet economy]], invested more money to produce less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. The [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet economy]] became increasingly energy-intensive, requiring 0.83 tons of coal equivalent to generate $1,000 of economic income by 1987, up from 0.71 tons in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Unlike Western economies, where a significant share of oil consumption comes from flexible sectors like private car drivers, nearly half of Soviet oil consumption came from heavy industry, offering little room for consumption cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

## The 1986 Oil Price Collapse
By the late 1980s, despite being the world's largest oil producer and third-largest coal producer, the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet economy]] stagnated due to its unproductive energy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Coherence within the Eastern Bloc faded as the Soviets prioritized their own needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

In 1986, oil prices collapsed, falling from $27 to below $10 a barrel due to increased output from Alaska, the British North Sea, and OPEC (particularly Saudi Arabia's increased quotas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This rendered all the massive Soviet investment in oil production unprofitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Foreign currency earnings from oil and gas evaporated, paving the way for the debt crisis that contributed to the [[collapse of the Soviet Union linked to oil and gas industry challenges | dissolution of the Soviet Union]] a few years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

## Legacy
The immense energy revenues from West Siberia papered over the urgent need for economic reforms in the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Oil money allowed the Soviets to buy imported meat, butter, and computers from the West instead of improving domestic agriculture or developing its own advanced technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

Energy, paradoxically, both supported and undermined the [[Soviet Union]]. It acted as a pillar, allowing the Soviet system to endure longer than it might have otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. However, it also served as a "crutch," weakening the country's capacity for self-sustaining growth and reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. The legacy of the [[rise of the Soviet Union as an energy superpower | Soviet energy superpower]] and its influence on European and Asian politics continues to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

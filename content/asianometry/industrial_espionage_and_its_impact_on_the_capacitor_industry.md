The early 2000s witnessed a notable period of widespread capacitor failures, often referred to as the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Alongside technical explanations for these failures, a prominent narrative emerged involving industrial espionage, suggesting that the theft of a critical electrolyte formula contributed significantly to the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## The Rubycon Story: Allegations of Stolen Formula

The core of the industrial espionage narrative, reported by Dennis Zogbi in "Passive Component Industry" magazine, points to the Japanese electronics company Rubycon Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

The story alleges that a materials scientist from Rubycon left to join the Taiwanese company Luminous Town Electric's factory in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. There, the scientist is said to have replicated Rubycon's P-50 water-based electrolyte formula, which Luminous Town then reportedly used in their aluminium E-caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

A further twist in the tale suggests that some of the scientist's staffers subsequently defected from Luminous Town, taking the electrolyte formula with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. They then allegedly sold this formula either directly to other Taiwanese E-cap companies or to an electrolyte provider who then resold it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

The critical flaw, according to this narrative, was that the defecting staffers did not possess the complete formula; crucial additives were missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. These missing components led to hydrogen gas build-up within the E-caps, causing them to rupture or break <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### Industry Response and Denials

Zogbi's story implicated between 5 to 11 Taiwanese producers as being affected by this faulty electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. IBM, a PC manufacturer at the time, acknowledged a "minuscule" problem, with less than 1% of their PCs returned for repair due to capacitor failure-induced short-circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Taiwanese motherboard maker ABIT also admitted to an E-cap problem and responded by switching from Taiwanese to Japanese suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. ABIT later faced a lawsuit for selling defective capacitors as early as 1999, contributing to their eventual exit from the motherboard business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

The IEEE Spectrum magazine named Lien Yan in Taichung as the electrolyte company accused of purchasing the flawed, stolen formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Lien Yan denied these accusations, stating they heavily damaged their business and claiming that suppliers of several bulged capacitors never bought their electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. They suggested the Rubycon story was "FUD" (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) spread by the Japanese to regain business from Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

Conversely, Luxon, one of Taiwan's largest capacitor suppliers, issued a statement blaming Lien Yan ("Lenyan") for the issues and emphasizing that Luxon developed its electrolyte internally to ensure reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. The importance of the electrolyte as a critical trade secret that determines a capacitor's operating conditions (temperature, voltage, safety) was underscored, highlighting the complexity of these chemical formulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### The Missing Additive

A 2004 report by the Center for Advanced Life Cycle Engineering at the University of Maryland, commissioned by a capacitor maker, indicated that bulging capacitors' electrolytes were missing a critical additive known as a "depolarizer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Depolarizers are crucial for reducing gas generation within the E-cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Their absence made the electrolyte more alkaline, leading to the dissolution of the aluminium oxide dielectric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This thinning of the dielectric caused capacitance to unnaturally increase, a key indicator of bulging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Subsequent reactions between exposed aluminium foil impurities and hydrogen ions in the water-based electrolyte then produced hydrogen gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

## Broader Context and Skepticism

While the Rubycon industrial espionage story is often intertwined with the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]], its overall influence is debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Although industrial espionage is a real phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, it is skeptical that a single defector from Rubycon could be solely responsible for an industry-wide issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The widespread nature of capacitor failures across various devices, including unrelated types like the Xbox's PowerStor Aerogel supercapacitor, suggests that not all failures can be attributed to the Rubycon story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

Additionally, conflicting timelines exist; while the Rubycon incident was reported around mid-2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>, failures continued into 2007, such as with Dell's OptiPlex PCs, which were shipped with faulty capacitors from Japanese manufacturer Nichicon between May 2003 and July 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Dell later paid $300 million for replacements due to issues with these capacitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

It is proposed that the capacitor failures were more broadly a result of [[market_and_supply_chain_issues_affecting_capacitor_production_and_reliability | industry-wide challenges]], particularly the use of new low-ESR aluminium E-caps with water-based electrolytes introduced in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. These caps struggled to handle the increasing heat from power-hungry microprocessors of the early 2000s, leading to electrolyte boiling and container rupture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. The resolution of the "Plague" coincided with the transition to multi-core CPUs, which reduced internal temperatures, and capacitor manufacturers gaining proficiency in making aqueous electrolytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

## Counterfeiting as a Supply Chain Vulnerability

Another factor potentially contributing to widespread failures is the rise of counterfeits due to the increasing complexity of the supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. When [[market_and_supply_chain_issues_affecting_capacitor_production_and_reliability | supply chain disruptions]] occur, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) might procure components from unauthorized distributors or the grey market to avoid long waiting times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. These counterfeit capacitors, despite possibly bearing legitimate brand names, often lack the quality and longevity of genuine products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. For example, a 2014 study of counterfeit Nichicon E-caps, found after the 2011 earthquake disrupted the legitimate supply, revealed that their water-based electrolyte lacked sufficient ethylene glycol, which lowered its boiling point and made it unstable at higher temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

In conclusion, while industrial espionage stories like the Rubycon incident are compelling and industrial espionage is a real concern, the widespread nature of the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]] was likely a complex confluence of factors, including evolving technology, manufacturing challenges, and vulnerabilities within the [[market_and_supply_chain_issues_affecting_capacitor_production_and_reliability | global supply chain]], rather than solely the result of a single act of industrial theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

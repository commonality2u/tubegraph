From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 
Lithium-ion iron phosphate (LFP) batteries are a specific type of [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion battery]] distinguished by their cathode chemistry, which utilizes iron phosphate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Historically, LFP batteries were perceived as inexpensive and low-end due to inherent chemical limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. However, significant developments, particularly originating from China, have transformed their market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

In 2024, the price of lithium-ion battery packs, including LFPs, saw a 20% reduction, reaching $115 per kilowatt-hour, marking the most significant price cut since 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Chemistry and Characteristics
[[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | Lithium-ion batteries]] consist of two electrodes: a cathode and an anode, with the anode typically made of graphite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The cathode is the most expensive component, accounting for over 70% of the battery's value, and dictates the battery type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

The three primary battery chemistries are:
*   **Ternary Batteries**: Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) and Nickel Cobalt Aluminum (NCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. These cathodes mix three materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Lithium-ion Iron Phosphate (LFP)**: Uses a dual-chemistry cathode made from iron phosphate, containing no cobalt or nickel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Advantages of LFP
*   **Cost-Effectiveness**: Since iron and phosphorus are significantly more common than nickel and cobalt, LFPs possess a substantial cost advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Raw materials account for 70% of a battery's cost, and for LFP, 80% of that material cost is just iron phosphate and lithium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **Cycle Life**: LFPs are better at retaining their initial energy capacity over many charge and discharge cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Safety**: Their lower energy density inherently reduces the risks of thermal runaway, meaning a fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. This makes them a safer option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Raw Material Availability**: Abundance of iron and phosphorus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **[[trends_in_global_battery_material_prices_and_their_effects_on_the_market | Favorable Material Price Trends]]**: A significant factor in the price crash of lithium-ion batteries was the concurrent decline in raw material prices after 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. New lithium sources in Australia, Chile, and Argentina reversed a 2022 shortage, causing prices to crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Iron prices also fell due to China's real estate crisis impacting crude steel production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

### Disadvantages of LFP
*   **Lower Energy Density**: LFPs typically suffer from lower energy densities, ranging from 90 to 160 watt-hours per kilogram, significantly less than NCA (230 to 260 Wh/kg) and NMC (250 to 320 Wh/kg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This means LFP-powered EVs generally have shorter driving ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Initial Performance Issues**: Early LFP designs (as pioneered by Dr. John Goodenough) faced poor electrical conductivity issues, hindering commercial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Summary of Trade-offs
Generally, batteries involve a trade-off between performance, cost, and safety. LFP batteries excel in cost and safety but traditionally lag in performance (energy density/range), while NMC and NCA prioritize performance but incur higher costs and thermal risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Historical Development and [[impact_of_chinas_government_policies_on_lfp_battery_adoption | China's Influence]]
In the early days of electric vehicles (EVs), Western pioneering cars like the Chevrolet Volt, Nissan Leaf, and Tesla Model S predominantly used ternary cathode chemistries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

In contrast, Chinese EV manufacturers, influenced by early government policies like the "Thousands of Vehicles, Tens of Cities" (TVTC) policy launched in 2009, initially adopted LFPs for public service fleets like buses and taxis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Companies like BYD became early pioneers in LFP due to cost and safety advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, leading to LFP dominance in the Chinese EV industry for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

However, starting in late 2016, Chinese government subsidy policies shifted to encourage higher energy density, longer driving ranges, faster charging, and fuel savings, favoring ternary batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This led to LFP's market share falling to 30% by mid-2019, with ternary batteries reaching about 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## LFP Revitalization

### Subsidy Withdrawal
The trend reversed starting in June 2019, when the Chinese government began to withdraw its EV cash subsidy policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The aggressive sunsetting of subsidies, including a 50% reduction in mid-2019, leveled the cost playing field and prompted EV makers to switch back to LFP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### [[technological_innovations_in_lfp_battery_production | Technological Innovations]]
LFP manufacturers introduced new [[technological_innovations_in_lfp_battery_production | technologies]] to mitigate LFP's inherent weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Cell-to-Pack (CTP) Technology (BYD Blade)**: Introduced by BYD in March 2020, the Blade battery entirely skips the module level in battery manufacturing, placing cells directly into the battery pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This "Cell-to-Pack" (CTP) approach maximizes the pack's volume usage, compensating for LFP's lower energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. BYD re-engineered prismatic cells into a long, ultra-thin "blade" shape for structural integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. CTP gives LFP battery packs about 85% the energy density of conventional NMC batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Other major Chinese manufacturers like CATL also adopted CTP [[technological_innovations_in_lfp_battery_production | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **LMFP (Lithium Manganese Iron Phosphate)**: This chemistry adds manganese to LFP, resulting in higher energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **"Double Firing" Process**: This new manufacturing method involves partially firing raw precursors at a lower temperature, then milling and carbon coating them before a second firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This process leads to more uniform particles and consistent performance, ideal for long-range, fast-charging EVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

These innovations led to LFP battery volumes surpassing NMC in 2021, accounting for nearly 70% of EV installations by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

### Patent Expiration
Key patents covering innovations in carbon coating and process [[technological_innovations_in_lfp_battery_production | technologies]] that made LFP commercially viable were consolidated into a Swiss entity managing global licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. In the 2000s or 2010s, Chinese battery makers were allowed to use these LFP patents for free, but only within their local markets, while others had to pay license fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This "patent shield" allowed China to build proficiency in LFP, while the rest of the world focused on non-LFP structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. These patents expired in 2022, enabling foreign manufacturers to access LFP chemistry without licensing fees, but they faced a significant disadvantage due to China's established supply chain, economies of scale, and talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

### Increased Competition
In 2021, BYD, which previously only used its batteries for its own cars, began selling its Blade batteries to third parties like Toyota and Ford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. This introduced a new major supplier, triggering a price war in an already highly competitive Chinese EV market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

## Applications Beyond EVs
The declining prices of LFP batteries have had significant spillover effects into other industries, particularly utility-scale stationary energy storage systems (BESS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. LFPs were already favored for BESS due to their lower material costs and resistance to thermal runaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. The Chinese EV boom intensified this trend, making BESS incredibly cheap and simple to build, often housed in standard-sized containers for deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. While BESS may not match the capacity of pumped storage systems, they provide 1-2 hours of power, proving highly competitive and attracting billions in investments in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Market analysts anticipate that LFP prices will continue to decline, though at a slower pace than in previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. A key area to watch is the [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | technological progress]] of [[commercialization_and_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. While [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] currently suffer from fundamental energy density shortcomings compared to [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | lithium-ion]], sodium is more accessible than lithium, offers faster charging, and its energy density numbers are improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. However, the highly optimized LFP supply chain presents a formidable challenge for sodium-ion technology to achieve a similar impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

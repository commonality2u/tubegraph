The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted the semiconductor supply chain, leading to [[chip_shortages_and_the_potential_for_oversupply | massive shortages]], particularly in trailing edge semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Initial Downturn and Cancellations

In early 2020, the onset of pandemic lockdowns caused economic activity to plummet to record lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This led to widespread fear among companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Automotive companies and other manufacturers responded by halting their production lines and canceling orders with suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This ripple effect traveled throughout the entire [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_and_geopolitical_tensions | supply chain]], causing semiconductor foundries to power down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. For example, ST Microelectronics cut production by 50% at their most advanced fabs in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Unexpected Recovery and Shortages

Contrary to initial fears, a massive and unexpected bounce back in economic activity occurred in the summer of 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This rapid rebound led to a surge in demand as companies scrambled to get products to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Manufacturers first depleted their existing inventories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. To replenish stocks and ensure future production, they began ordering more chips than immediately needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This sudden surge, combined with a pre-existing tightness in trailing edge node capacity for several years prior to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, resulted in significant [[chip_shortages_and_the_potential_for_oversupply | shortages]] across the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Contributing Factors to Shortages

Beyond the pandemic's direct impact, other factors exacerbated the [[chip_shortages_and_the_potential_for_oversupply | semiconductor shortages]]:
*   **Unprecedented Demand** – The broader semiconductor industry experienced unprecedented demand for chips, driven by factors such as cloud computing, the wireless 5G transition, and armed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Pre-existing Trailing Edge Capacity Issues** – Prior to the pandemic, fab capacity at trailing edge nodes was already relatively tight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This was due to hesitation from trailing edge chip makers to invest in new fabs, as customers were accustomed to paying prices set by foundries with fully depreciated fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Wafers for these nodes were very cheap, accounting for only 10% of total sales revenues despite contributing significant microprocessor volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Investing hundreds of millions or billions in a new fab was seen as risking substantial underutilization and financial underperformance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Long-Term Consequences

Since 2019, fab utilization rates have risen far beyond their long-term targets of 80%, reaching levels in the mid-90s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This indicates that foundries are pushing their existing fabs to their limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Microchip executive chairman Steve Sanghi stated that an additional $150 billion in investment is needed over five years to meet trailing edge demand growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. However, building out trailing edge capacity is very slow, growing at about 2% annually, compared to over 25% at the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. While hundreds of billions have been committed to new fabs globally, only 6% is dedicated to mature or legacy node capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

As a result, backlogs for older nodes have stretched to 18 months or longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Supply constraints for trailing edge chips are expected to continue until at least 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. The slowing growth in revenues for trailing edge nodes and an apparent slowing in the macro economy may eventually dampen demand, potentially aligning with future supply capacity increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

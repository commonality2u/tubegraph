In late February 2022, Taiwan's Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced it would halt shipments to Russia due to a new round of sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This halt by TSMC impacted shipments from "fabless" companies such as Baikal, MCST, Yadro, and STC Module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Intel and AMD also stopped their shipments to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Russia's Semiconductor Manufacturing Landscape

For years, Russia has aimed to establish its own semiconductor supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While the country has seen some notable domestic design successes, its capacity to manufacture these designs has significantly lagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This highlights the [[challenges_in_russian_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenges in Russian semiconductor manufacturing]] and the broader [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_and_geopolitical_tensions | global semiconductor supply chain and geopolitical tensions]].

### Historical Context

The Soviet Union suffered from a substantial technology gap in computers and advanced electronics compared to the United States, a disparity that began as early as the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. By the time of its collapse in 1991, the country was severely affected by a shortage of sufficiently powerful integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The combined computing power of all computers in the Soviet Union at that time would still be two generations behind a single American Cray supercomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The collapse fragmented the Soviet scientific-industrial complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Russia retained 96% of the vacuum electronics production facilities, while the most advanced semiconductor production facilities were located in East Germany, Belarus, and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Russian industrial policy post-collapse exacerbated this issue by shifting away from domestic electronics, increasing the country's reliance on imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Current Import Dependency

Today, Russia remains a net importer and consumer of integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. In 2020, most of these circuits came from Malaysia, China, Vietnam, and other Asian countries, including Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

In 2014, in the wake of sanctions following the Crimea annexation, the Russian government committed to developing its own homegrown chips, leading to an import substitution scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Russian Domestic Semiconductor Companies

### Micron Group

Micron Group is Russia's largest domestic semiconductor manufacturing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. It operates as an integrated design manufacturer, producing approximately 500 million chips annually and accounting for 54% of the country's exported technology hardware products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

*   **History:** Founded in 1964 as the Research Institute for Molecular Electronics, its plant was the first in Russia to successfully produce an integrated circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. In the 1970s and 1980s, it produced microprocessors for applications like air defense and Venus space programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Along with Angstrom of Russia and Integral of Belarus, Micron formed the "big three" Soviet IC manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Products:** Today, Micron fabs RFID tickets, SIM cards, and smart card products, specializing in RFID technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. They produce about 30 million banking cards, biometric passports, and transport cards annually, including chips for Russia's Mir domestic payment card system and Moscow's transport network tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Operations & Financials:** Micron employs about 1,500 people and serves over 400 customers in Russia, including top cell carriers, transport companies, banks, and government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. They also have 100 overseas customers serviced by sales offices in Japan, China, and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Revenues were approximately $195 million USD in 2019 and $260 million USD in 2020 (bolstered by Moscow government subsidies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The company reported a net loss in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Technology Nodes:** Micron's Zelenograd fab produces 100mm, 150mm, and 200mm wafers, with the 200mm line being the most sophisticated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. In 2007, Micron acquired IP for STMicroelectronics' 180nm process node, expanding to 90nm in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The 90nm production line launched in 2012, costing about $590 million USD and co-financed by Rusnano, a government fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. When this node reached commercial production in 2003, Russia was about nine years behind the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **65nm Challenges:** In 2014, Micron announced the successful achievement of a 65nm node at a volume of 500 200mm wafers per month, hailed as "proof of Russian technology independence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. However, this announcement appears premature, as the process was more a "working science experiment" than a commercial offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Commercial viability at 65nm is difficult without imported lithography scanners from the West or Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The Micron website still lists its 65nm production line as "under development, production qualification and implementation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Fujitsu, Toshiba, and TSMC began shipping commercial 65nm nodes in 2005, indicating Russia's gap with the leading edge has expanded to 15+ years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Future Plans:** A new management team in 2016 planned investments to expand the factory, produce more chip types and LEDs, and achieve 30 billion rubles in revenue by 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This included a 28nm capable factory by 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. However, the company missed its 2020 revenue target by 15 billion rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Citronix

Citronix, a sister company to Micron, applied for a subsidy in 2007 to develop a chip manufacturing fab at 65nm and 45nm process nodes on 300mm wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. The proposed project, jointly financed with the Russian government, would have cost about $2.3 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Chip production was scheduled to begin in 2009, but the sheer capital intensity, coupled with a lack of technology partners, likely prevented it from moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Currently, Citronix's website lists servers, IT software, and smartwatches, but no chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Angstrom

Angstrom is another leading Russian microelectronics fab, headquartered in Zelenograd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

*   **History:** Dating back to 1963, it was known for developing and producing the Electronics NTS-8010, the Soviet Union's first completely domestic computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Technology & Capacity:** The foundry currently offers 130nm and 90nm process nodes on 200mm wafers, with a capacity of about 180,000 wafers per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This is a significantly smaller scale than a TSMC "gigafab," which produces an equivalent number in a single month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Financial Struggles & Sanctions:** Angstrom filed for bankruptcy in 2018 or 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. In 2008, the company borrowed nearly a billion dollars from the state development bank VEB to purchase old 110nm and 130nm chip-making equipment from AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The goal was to produce 90nm smart card microchips by 2010 and upgrade to 65nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. However, chips only started rolling off the line in 2016, and its 65nm process is not yet available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Shortly thereafter, Angstrom was hit by U.S. sanctions, likely due to its involvement in the Russian military and nuclear industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. These sanctions prevented an export business, and combined with debt, pushed it into insolvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **New Ownership:** In 2021, VEB founded a subsidiary called NM-Tech, which acquired Angstrom's assets for 8.4 billion rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. NM-Tech announced a 10-year plan to convert Angstrom into a pure-play foundry and pursue 10nm production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## Russian Semiconductor Design Ventures

Given the lagging capabilities of the domestic industry, more sophisticated semiconductor design ventures must rely on foreign fabs for chip production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. This highlights the ongoing [[russian_domestic_semiconductor_companies_and_their_developments | Russian domestic semiconductor companies and their developments]] and the challenges they face.

### Elbrus Microprocessors

The Elbrus 2SM, developed by the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies, was the first completely Russian microprocessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Its creation in 2014 was declared the year's top technology achievement by local media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. This 90nm processor was likely more for PR than practical use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The original Elbrus processor, made using a TSMC 90nm node, appeared to perform better than the Micron version, despite being three years older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The latest iteration, the Elbrus 8CB chip, is fabbed on a 28nm process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

### Baikal CPUs

Baikal Electronics uses modern practices and EDA tools like Synopsys to develop ARM-based chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Their latest offering, the Baikal-M series, is an eight-core system-on-chip fabbed on a TSMC 28nm process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. A RISC-V version is also under exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Baikal planned to order over 200,000 pieces from TSMC in Q1 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, but faced issues securing enough fab capacity due to the automaker chip shortages, highlighting the [[impact_of_the_pandemic_on_semiconductor_supply_chain | impact of the pandemic on semiconductor supply chain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

In June 2021, Baikal was acquired by the Vartan Group, an electronics conglomerate that also develops Astra Linux, Russia's domestic OS frequently used within the Russian government, including its military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Baikal then announced a plan to invest 23 billion rubles to expand into the server space, develop a 6nm chip, and sell over half a million Baikal chips, primarily to government organizations adhering to Russian import substitution policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## Potential Alternatives for Russia

Considering the current circumstances, it is doubtful that the Russian semiconductor manufacturing industry will advance past 65nm in the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Therefore, [[potential_alternatives_for_russian_semiconductor_needs | potential alternatives for Russian semiconductor needs]] in friendly countries capable of replacing the missing capacity are being explored.

### Belarus (Integral)

A significant portion of Soviet integrated circuit production was located in Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Integral, one of the "big three" Soviet semiconductor manufacturers launched in 1962, is an integrated design manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. However, Integral's most sophisticated node in 2017 was a 350nm process, which first hit the market in 1993 (used for the Nintendo 64) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. This is not a viable alternative to a TSMC 28nm node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### China (SMIC)

Chinese semiconductor foundries, particularly Shanghai-based SMIC, could potentially be a capable TSMC replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. SMIC's most advanced node is a 14nm process, rumored to have good yields, though it's not a major part of their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. The company had a strong 2021 and is investing $9 billion into a new fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Given the warm relations between Russia and China, SMIC might make sense for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. However, SMIC heavily relies on chip-making equipment imports from the Netherlands and Japan, raising concerns about the [[impact_of_us_export_bans_on_smic | impact of US export bans on SMIC]] if secondary sanctions were to be imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## Short-Term Impact and Long-Term Implications

In the short and medium term, the halt in shipments may not have an immediate drastic effect on Russia, as the country likely has large stockpiles of raw product and contingency plans in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. Additionally, military equipment typically does not require cutting-edge 7nm chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

However, these sanctions will inevitably cause what remains of Russia's industries to fall further behind its competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Even Russia's largest industries consistently lag Western peers in digitization and modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. For example:

*   Russia has 23 times fewer industrial robots per 10,000 employees than the world average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   Its share of computer numerical control (CNC) machines in industry is only 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
*   Only 1% of data generated by its installed sensors is utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

These sanctions make it significantly harder for Russian businesses and their employees to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. In the late Soviet era, the Communist Party's failure to close the widening technology gap with the West contributed to a broad loss of confidence in its competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. While times are different today, the historical parallel raises questions about the long-term impact on Russia's technological standing and economic future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

In late February 2022, [[TSMC]] announced it would halt shipments to Russia due to a new round of sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This decision impacted fabless companies like Baikal, MCST, Yadro, and STC Module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Intel and AMD also ceased their shipments to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Russia's Semiconductor Industry: A Historical Context

For years, Russia has aimed to develop its own semiconductor supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While there have been successes in domestic design, the capacity to manufacture those designs domestically has lagged significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

Historically, the Soviet Union faced a substantial technology gap with the United States in computers and advanced electronics, dating back to the 1960s, driven by ideology, technology, and geopolitics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. By the Soviet collapse in 1991, the country suffered from a painful shortage of powerful integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. At that time, the combined computing power of all computers in the Soviet Union was two generations behind a single American Cray supercomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The collapse fragmented the Soviet scientific industrial complex, leaving Russia with 96% of vacuum electronics production facilities, while the more advanced semiconductor production facilities were in East Germany, Belarus, and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Post-collapse, Russian industrial policy exacerbated this issue by moving away from domestic electronics, increasing reliance on imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

Today, Russia remains a net importer and consumer of integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. In 2020, most of these imports came from Malaysia, China, Vietnam, and other Asian countries, including Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

In 2014, threatened sanctions following events in Crimea prompted the Russian government to pursue developing its own homegrown chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This "import substitution" initiative led to the Elbrus 2SM, a 90-nanometer CPU developed by the Moscow Center of SPARK Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This chip was fabricated domestically by JSC Micron Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Key Russian Semiconductor Manufacturing Companies

#### Micron Group
Micron Group is Russia's largest domestic semiconductor manufacturing company, operating as an integrated design manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. It accounts for 54% of Russia's exported technology hardware products and produces approximately 500 million chips annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

*   **History and Products:** Founded in 1964 as the Research Institute for Molecular Electronics, Micron was the first in the country to successfully produce an integrated circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. In the 1970s and 80s, it produced microprocessors for air defense and Venus space programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Along with Angstrom and Integral, it formed Russia's "big three" IC manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Today, Micron fabs RFID tickets, SIM cards, and smart card products, specializing in RFID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. They produce around 30 million banking, biometric passport, and transport cards annually, including chips for Russia's Mir payment system and Moscow's transport network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Operations and Financials:** Micron employs about 1,500 people and serves over 400 customers in Russia, including top cell carriers, transport companies, leading banks, and government agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. They also have 100 overseas customers serviced by sales offices in Japan, China, and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. In 2019, the company generated $195 million USD in revenue, increasing to $260 million USD in 2020, though the latter was bolstered by large government subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Technology Capabilities:** Micron's Zelenograd fab produces 100mm, 150mm, and 200mm wafers, with the 200mm line being the most sophisticated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   **Technology Transfer:** In 2007, Micron signed a technology transfer deal with STMicroelectronics for 180nm process node IP, expanding to 90nm in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The 90nm production line launched in 2012, costing 16.5 billion rubles (approx. $590 million USD at 2017 rates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This project was co-financed by Rusnano, a government fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. When commercial production began in 2012, Russia was about nine years behind the leading edge (which achieved 90nm in 2003) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   **65nm Ambitions:** In 2014, Micron announced the successful achievement of a 65nm node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, hailed as "proof of Russian technology independence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. However, this announcement appears to have been premature, being more of a "working science experiment" than a commercial offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. A 65nm line is not commercially viable without imported lithography scanners from the West or Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Micron's website still lists 65nm production as "under development, production qualification and implementation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. With commercial 65nm nodes shipping in 2005 (Fujitsu, Toshiba, [[TSMC]]), Russia's gap with the leading edge has expanded to 15+ years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Management Changes:** In 2016, Micron's management team was replaced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The new team announced ambitious plans to invest in expanding the factory to produce more chip types and LEDs, aiming for 30 billion rubles of revenue by 2020, and a 28nm capable factory by 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The company missed the 2020 revenue target by 15 billion rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

#### Sitronics
Sitronics, a sister company to Micron, applied for a subsidy in 2007 to develop a chip manufacturing fab at 65nm and 45nm process nodes on 300mm wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. The proposed project, co-financed by the Russian government, was estimated to cost $2.3 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Chip production was scheduled for 2009, but the sheer capital intensity likely caused Sitronics to pull back, especially given the absence of technology partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Their website currently lists servers, IT software, and smartwatches, but no chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

#### Angstrom
Angstrom is another one of Russia's leading microelectronics fabs, headquartered in Zelenograd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

*   **History and Capabilities:** Dating back to 1963, Angstrom was known for developing and producing the Electronics NTS 8010, the Soviet Union's first completely domestic computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Currently, the foundry offers 130nm and 90nm process nodes on 200mm wafers, with a capacity of about 180,000 wafers a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This is a significant shortfall compared to a [[TSMC]] gigafab, which produces that equivalent number in a single month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Financial Struggles and Sanctions:** Due to a lack of scale, Angstrom filed for bankruptcy around 2018 or 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. In 2008, the company borrowed nearly a billion dollars from the state development bank VEB to purchase old 110nm and 130nm chip-making equipment from AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The plan was to produce 90nm smart card microchips by 2010 and upgrade to 65nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. However, chips only started rolling off the line in 2016, and their 65nm process is still not available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **[[Impact of American sanctions on Chinese technology | U.S. sanctions]]** hit Angstrom shortly after, likely due to its involvement in the Russian military and nuclear industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This prevented it from building an export business, which, combined with debt, led to insolvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. In 2021, VEB's subsidiary, NM Tech, purchased Angstrom's assets for 8.4 billion rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. NM Tech announced a 10-year plan to convert Angstrom into a pure-play foundry and aim for 10nm production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Russian Chip Design Ventures Dependent on Foreign Fabs

Due to the [[Russias domestic semiconductor industry challenges | lagging capabilities of the domestic industry]], more sophisticated Russian semiconductor design ventures have historically relied on foreign fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

*   **Moscow Center of SPARK Technologies (Elbrus):** Their Elbrus 2SM, the first completely Russian microprocessor, was unveiled in 2014 and declared the year's top technology achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. This 90nm processor was initially made using a [[TSMC]] 90nm node, and that older iteration reportedly performed better than the Micron version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The latest iteration, the Elbrus 8CB, is fabbed on a 28nm process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Baikal Electronics (Baikal):** Baikal takes a different approach, using modern EDA tools to develop an ARM-based chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Their latest offering, the Baikal M series, is an eight-core system-on-chip fabbed on a [[TSMC]] 28nm process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Sales were performing well, with plans to order over 200,000 pieces from [[TSMC]] in Q1 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. However, they faced issues getting enough fab capacity due to global chip shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. In June 2021, Baikal was acquired by Varton Group, which also makes Russia's domestic OS, AstroLinux, used within the Russian government and military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Baikal then announced plans to invest 23 billion rubles to expand into the server space, develop a 6nm chip, and sell over half a million chips, mostly to government organizations meeting import substitution policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

## Consequences of TSMC Sanctions

Given the current circumstances, the [[Russias domestic semiconductor industry challenges | Russian semiconductor manufacturing industry]] is unlikely to advance past 65 nanometers in the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. The halt of [[TSMC]] shipments effectively cuts off access for sophisticated Russian designs like Elbrus and Baikal to leading-edge fabrication.

### Possible Alternatives for Semiconductor Sourcing

Russia might seek [[Potential Russian alternatives for semiconductor sourcing | alternatives in friendly countries]] to replace this missing capacity.

*   **Belarus (Integral):** Integral was one of the "big three" Soviet semiconductor manufacturers, launched in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. However, their most sophisticated node in 2017 was a 350nm process, which first hit the market in 1993 (used for the Nintendo 64) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. This is not a viable alternative to a [[TSMC]] 28nm node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **China (SMIC):** Chinese semiconductor foundries, particularly Shanghai-based SMIC, could potentially be a capable [[TSMC]] replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. SMIC's most advanced node is a 14nm process, though it's not a large part of their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. SMIC is investing $9 billion into a new fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Given the warm relations between Russia and China, SMIC might seem like a good option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. However, SMIC heavily relies on chip-making equipment imports from the Netherlands and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, which could make them vulnerable to secondary sanctions if they assist Russia.

### Overall [[Impact of geopolitical tensions on semiconductor industry | Impact and Challenges]]

In the short to medium term, the halt of shipments may not have an immediate drastic effect, as Russia holds large stockpiles and basic military equipment does not require leading-edge chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

However, these sanctions will inevitably cause what remains of Russia's industries to fall further behind competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Russia's largest industries already lag Western peers in digitization and modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. For example, Russia has 23 times fewer industrial robots per 10,000 employees than the world average, its share of computer numerical control (CNC) machines in industry is only ten percent, and only one percent of data from installed sensors is utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. These sanctions make it significantly harder for Russian businesses and citizens to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

Historically, the Soviet Communist Party's inability to close the technology gap with the West contributed to a widespread loss of confidence in its competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. While times are different today, the current situation presents similar challenges for Russia's technological future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

By 1986, the Soviet Union possessed just over 10,000 computers, significantly trailing the United States' 1.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While the Soviet Union was the world's third most proficient computing power at the time of Stalin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, a significant computing gap emerged by the 1960s, becoming "undeniable and basically permanent" by 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Despite the Soviet state's strong belief in science and industrial modernization, abundant support for research and development in hard sciences, and having top minds who launched Sputnik and landed on Venus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, its centralized planning system ultimately hindered technological advancement.

## Early Efforts and Political Interference

In 1948, news of the ENIAC, the first general-purpose programmable computer built in the United States two years prior, reached the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Recognizing the need to improve calculating workflows, particularly for nuclear weapons development which required over 100 "calculator girls" working daily eight-hour shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, the Soviet Union established the Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Technology (ITMVT) within the Soviet Academy of Sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

However, ITMVT's initial efforts were directed towards mechanical analog calculating machines due to the political influence of its director, General Nikolai Brevich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Brevich "thoroughly believed that reliable electronic general computers in the near future were impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. While many scientists believed this direction was wrong, voicing such concerns during the Stalin era was dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Ukrainian Breakthrough and Central Control

In Ukraine, Sergey Lebedev, director of the Kiev Electrotechnical Institute, learned of American digital computer efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Recognizing the computer's importance, he built his own "little calculating machine," the Mali Electrono-Machina (MESM), between 1948 and 1950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The MESM, despite its ironic name (it had 6,000 vacuum tubes and took up 60 square meters), solved its first real calculation in December 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

The MESM impressed future Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, then secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This success allowed "renegade scientists" at ITMVT to reach out to Khrushchev, leading to Brevich's deposition and permission for ITMVT to proceed with a more powerful digital computer, the Bolshaya Electronia (BESM One) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The BESM One, capable of 8,000 to 10,000 operations per second (8-10 kiloflops), would have been one of the world's fastest computers, significantly outperforming America's leading UNIVAC 1 (1 kiloflop) in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

However, ITMVT struggled to deliver the BESM One due to competition and resource denial from another centrally-controlled institute. The Ministry of Machine and Instrument Engineering had established SKB245 to make mechanical analog computers, but SKB245 went against its mandate and proposed building its own digital computer, the Strela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Although the Strela was computationally inferior (2 kiloflops vs. BESM's 8-10 kiloflops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, Stalin blessed the competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. When ITMVT needed special cathode ray tubes for memory storage for the BESM, the Ministry of Machine and Instrument Engineering, SKB245's ministry, refused to supply them, forcing the BESM team to use inferior mercury storage tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. A 1951 state commission chose the Strela over the BESM One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

Actual users soon discovered serious issues with the Strela, including frequent breakdowns and inability to solve complex quadratic equations needed for fission development, which was a "fairly important" requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. By 1955, the head of the Soviet nuclear development effort requested BESM replacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Production and Demand Gap

While the Soviets achieved early successes in first-generation computers, the significant gap was at the production level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

*   **1959**: The Soviet Union produced computers worth a cumulative $59 million, compared to the United States' $1 billion in computer hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **1964**: The Soviet Union produced 200 million semiconductor pieces, far behind the United States' 1.36 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

This "battle was lost" due to the fundamental flaws of the Soviet command economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The [[role_of_computers_and_cybernetics_in_soviet_economic_planning | computer failed to tap its full potential]] because:

*   **Limited Demand**: While the military had some demand, it was finite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. In the West, computer-aided automation in industries like steel making and manufacturing drove "titanic commercial and industrial demand" far exceeding military needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Lack of Incentive**: Soviet steelmakers only needed to meet quotas, with no concern for quality or efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This meant Soviet computer makers had "little incentive to produce productivity improving computers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, nor to provide necessary training and customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Resource Allocation Issues**: Ministers were reluctant to risk their quotas by allocating limited resources to computer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This led to factories frequently failing to receive funding, materials, and talent; for example, the Penza computer plant requested 50 computer experts in 1958 but received only seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Distribution Problems**: The country consistently lagged in distributing new revolutionary technologies across its economy, despite pioneering innovations in fields like steel-making and synthetic fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Transition Challenges and the "Unified System"

The transition to second-generation transistor-based computers in the West, exemplified by the [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] 1401, which sold over 12,000 units and spurred new peripherals and programming paradigms, further widened the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. While the Soviets developed their own second-generation computers like the Ural series and the BESM-6 (their first [[evolution_of_supercomputing_technology | supercomputer]]), they remained two or so years behind the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

The real divergence began with third-generation computers powered by integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. In 1964, IBM announced the System 360, a revolutionary line of compatible hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. In the Soviet Union, it became clear that demand for computers was limitless, and the domestic industry needed to consolidate its "disparate parts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### The "Unified Systema" (ES) Project and [[strategic_decisions_in_soviet_computing_industry | Strategic Decisions]]

In 1967, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued Resolution 1184-20 to consolidate its computing industry into a series of unified third-generation computers, known as the "Unified Systema" (ES) project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The resolution significantly increased the computing manufacturing budget and directed the construction of 28 new plants and expansion of 22 existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

A controversial decision was made to copy the design of an American IBM 360 model to ensure ES compatibility with 360 software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Critics argued this would make the USSR "an intellectual colony of the West" and hinder its ability to innovate independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This decision was made despite the US government forbidding IBM from exporting 360 systems to the Soviet Union, forcing them to acquire systems through espionage or intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

An alternative was available: ICL, the UK's largest computer maker, offered to share technology and documentation from their 360-compatible System 4 line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. This would have provided 360 compatibility, allowed learning British programming methods, and retained some industrial sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. However, working with ICL would have delayed the project by at least 1.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, a politically difficult prospect given the wide Soviet-American computer gap, especially in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The Communist Party had made this a high political priority, and the penalties for missing deadlines were severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

This copying decision had "tragic, long-lasting consequences" on the Soviet computing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Several prominent scientists resigned in protest, and computer legend Sergey Lebedev's efforts to reverse the decision are said to have hastened his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

## Long-Term Consequences

Over 100 organizations, 46,000 scientists, and 300,000 workers across Eastern Europe contributed to the ES project, creating over 15,000 pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. While the ES's 360 compatibility did accelerate Soviet capabilities in the short term, shrinking the computing gap from 10-15 years in the mid-1960s to 4-6 years in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, this led to a long-term loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

Starting in the 1980s, the Soviet industry struggled to reverse-engineer increasingly complicated Western computers, widening the gap once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. The Soviets had lost the native industrial capacity to develop anything new on their own, making the gap permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. By 1989, a quarter of all Soviet general-purpose computers were ES-1022s, produced in 1974 but based on 1965 technology, meaning they were 24 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

The reliance on foreign technology also caused issues when the US and the West levied export bans on advanced technologies during international crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. While [[technology_transfer_and_economic_implications | technology transfer]] can be beneficial, the Soviet experience demonstrates that if the process fails to foster self-generated innovation, it can lead to an "uncontrollable and irreversible addiction to the imported technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

The fall of the Soviet computing industry was a story of "wasted talents, lost progress, foolish short-term strategic choices made by politicians over scientists, and the limits of [[bolshevik_policies_on_nationalization_and_central_planning | centralized planning]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

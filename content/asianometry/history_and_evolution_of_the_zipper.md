A zipper, also known as a slide fastener, is a device designed to join and bind the edges of two fabrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Early Innovations and The Modern Zipper

The modern slide fastener was invented in 1891 by Whitcomb Judson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. His initial goal was to reduce the effort required to button and unbutton high-button boots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Judson, primarily an engineer focused on pneumatic systems for public transit, developed the zipper as a side project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

His business partners recognized the product's potential, leading to the formation of a company to market it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This company underwent several transformations and ownership changes, eventually becoming Talon Inc., the original zipper company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Gideon Sundback's Contributions

Twenty years later, Talon hired Gideon Sundback, a Swedish-American electrical engineer, who became their head engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Sundback spent years improving the fastener's design to enhance its reliability and manufacturability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. In 1917, he patented the "Hookless Number Two," a device that featured the interlocking teeth structure characteristic of the modern zipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Crucially, Sundback also invented a machine capable of efficiently producing this new fastener design at scale, which was vital for its widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Popularization and Market Adoption

Initially, Talon struggled to convince textile companies to incorporate their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Early uses included soldiers' belts, life vests, sleeping bags during World War I, and tobacco bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

The term "zipper" emerged in 1923 when B.F. Goodrich used it for a rubber boot product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This boot dramatically increased demand; factory production surged from less than 20,000 zippers (between July 1918 and March 1919) to hundreds of thousands, forcing the factory to prioritize zipper production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Although Goodrich intended the term to refer to the boot, people quickly associated it with Talon Inc.'s hookless fastener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Talon was displeased with this generic trademark, running ads in the 1930s urging people to "Call this slide fastener Talon" in a futile attempt to control the term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

Despite the "zipper boot" success, Talon initially struggled to get garment manufacturers to use zippers in clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Manufacturers were concerned about higher costs compared to buttons, limited color options, and the perceived difficulty of integrating zippers into their workflow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Talon's efforts to overcome these challenges included:
*   Starting with girdles for women and work clothing for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   Including zippers in home sewing kits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   Hiring a sales force to target trouser makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   Holding zipper-themed fashion shows for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

These strategies gradually paid off, and Talon grew steadily through the Great Depression, producing over 200 million zippers by 1939, up from 80 million just three years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK's Emergence and Dominance]]

The story of the zipper then shifts to Japan with the emergence of [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK]], or Yoshida Kogyo Kabushiki Geisha, which translates to Yoshida Manufacturing Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK]] now holds approximately 90% of the Japanese market and 40% of the global market by value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

### Tadao Yoshida's Early Life and Business

Tadao Yoshida, born in 1908 in Uozu City, Japan, grew up in poverty and started small businesses to earn pocket money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Unable to continue his studies past age 15, he worked at a rubber boot shop and studied in his spare time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. In 1928, at age 20, he moved to Tokyo with 70 yen, determined to succeed in "big business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Yoshida found a job at Furia Shoten, an import store selling Chinese ceramics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. When war between Japan and China made importing Chinese ceramics impossible in 1931, the store shifted to selling slide fasteners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The store eventually closed, and Furia's owner advised Yoshida to utilize the remaining zipper inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

In January 1934, 25-year-old Yoshida established San S Shokai, taking over Furia's zipper inventory and striking a deal with another zipper manufacturer in Osaka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. At the time, over half of zippers were defective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Yoshida focused on improving quality, even testing workmanship by hitting zippers with a hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. His shop began producing its own zippers by building a metal factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. However, this factory was destroyed by Allied bombing in March 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

After Japan's defeat, Yoshida returned to Uozu City and met an American interested in exporting Japanese products. Yoshida's best zippers were deemed of insufficient quality and too expensive compared to American fasteners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## [[technical_aspects_and_manufacturing_process_of_zippers | Technical Aspects and Manufacturing Process of Zippers]]

Zippers comprise three main components: the tape, the teeth (or elements), and the slider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Teeth/Elements**: These parts mesh together to open and close the zipper, forming a chain when meshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Slider**: This component moves up and down, engaging with the elements to lock or unlock them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Stops at the ends prevent the slider from falling off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Tape**: This is the fabric part to which the teeth are attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Approximately 88% of a zipper's cost comes from main materials and labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Metal Zipper Production
The process for creating a metal zipper begins with pre-made Y-shaped metal wire, often a copper-zinc alloy for rust resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
1.  A tiny chip is sheared off the wire's end, which will become an element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
2.  A small hook-like protrusion (sometimes called a scoop) is forged into the element, designed to catch and hold the teeth together when the zipper is closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
3.  Finally, the tooth is attached to the tape by bending its two legs, a process known as attaching or bending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

Mechanical automation is essential for economic and effective zipper production, as a faulty zipper can render a garment useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Chain machines are used to automatically and accurately attach teeth to the tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK's] Production Innovations and Vertical Integration]

Yoshida recognized American-made chain machines, costing $30,000-$40,000 each, as crucial for achieving his desired zipper quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. After a significant effort, he secured an import license and a 12 million yen foreign exchange loan to acquire four such machines in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

These imported machines, which arrived in 1950, gave [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK]] a substantial competitive advantage, allowing six workers to perform the work of 160 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Yoshida immediately commissioned a Japanese company to produce 100 replicas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

[[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK]] then improved these machines in 1953 by enabling them to attach teeth at regular time intervals, eliminating the need for spacers and significantly speeding up manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Further improvements made the machines easier for a single person to operate and increased production volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

[[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK]] strongly embraced vertical integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. In 1954, Yoshida began work on the Kurobe Factory, an integrated campus designed to produce everything from the metal for wires to the textiles for tapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This philosophy extended overseas, with [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK]] USA Factory melting its own brass, creating polyester, and weaving its own zipper tapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Yoshida believed this control over raw material production provided advantages in developing new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

By 1958, [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK's]] automation prowess, ability to produce its own manufacturing machines, and control over its supply chain had established its market leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## [[comparison_between_ykk_and_competitors_like_talon_and_fujian_sps_zipper | Competition and Market Evolution]]

### Talon's Decline

Talon's decline and [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK's]] rise accelerated around 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. That year, Talon and its trade association failed to persuade the American government to restrict foreign zipper imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Talon's market share, which was 70% in 1971, fell to 35% by 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

However, government policy was not the sole reason for Talon's decline. [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK]] had already begun producing zippers in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. After failing to gain direct market entry in 1955, [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK]] started importing zipper parts for assembly in the U.S. in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. By 1974, [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK]] opened a vertically integrated factory in Macon, Georgia, which remains operational and has expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK]] has since followed textile manufacturers to low-cost labor regions globally, with factories in 71 countries today, building locally to bypass tariff barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

[[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK's]] control over the entire supply chain provided nimbleness and versatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Talon's own challenges contributed to its downfall, particularly after its acquisition by Textron in 1968 for $200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Textron, as brand managers rather than textile experts, lacked the on-the-ground experience to maintain Talon's competitiveness against foreign rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

Talon lost market share in industrial garments starting in the late 1960s, relying increasingly on its declining home sewing kit niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. They also failed to adapt to new fashion trends emphasizing freer, more colorful clothes made from stretchier synthetic fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK]], conversely, introduced innovations like the concealed zipper, which blended into garments, and plastic injection mold zippers, which could be dyed in vibrant colors to match contemporary fashions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

Talon was eventually sold by Textron and has since passed through various private equity owners, currently owned by Hong Kong company Tag It Pacific Inc., primarily producing in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

### The Modern Zipper Market

Today, the zipper market is segmented:
*   **Ultra High Luxury**: Dominated by European brands like Riri (Switzerland) and Lamppo (Italy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **Low End**: Dominated by manufacturers in China or India who compete solely on price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Middle to High End**: [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK]] operates primarily in this segment, accounting for about 80% of its $6 billion annual revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

### [[comparison_between_ykk_and_competitors_like_talon_and_fujian_sps_zipper | Competition from Fujian SPS Zipper]]

In recent years, [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK]] has faced significant competition in the middle to high-end market from China's [[comparison_between_ykk_and_competitors_like_talon_and_fujian_sps_zipper | Fujian SPS Zipper]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. Founded in 1984 in Jinjiang, China, by Kang, [[comparison_between_ykk_and_competitors_like_talon_and_fujian_sps_zipper | Fujian SPS Zipper]] started as a middleman, testing zipper quality with a hammer, much like Yoshida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. The company quickly expanded into production, aggressively selling affordable yet high-quality zippers to mid-fashion garment manufacturers like Zara, Target, and Michael Kors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. While [[comparison_between_ykk_and_competitors_like_talon_and_fujian_sps_zipper | Fujian SPS Zipper's]] revenue of about $300 million USD is less than [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK's]], it poses a direct challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

In response, [[ykk_company_history_and_global_dominance | YKK]] has aimed to produce higher quality luxury zippers and has aggressively expanded its operations in China, challenging [[comparison_between_ykk_and_competitors_like_talon_and_fujian_sps_zipper | SPS]] on its home turf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

The evolution of the humble zipper over more than a century demonstrates that manufacturing can be as technologically sophisticated as any software application, with immense research and development contributing to advancements often taken for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

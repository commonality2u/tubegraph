As [[World War II]] progressed, the Japanese military adopted methamphetamine for its war effort, using it to boost the stamina and alertness of its personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

## Introduction and Early Adoption
The German Army adopted methamphetamine under the brand name Pervitin in 1938 for its stimulant effects during [[World War II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Hearing about this, researchers like Kenosuke Miura encouraged the Japanese government to do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

In 1941, the Japanese government approved the commercial sale of both amphetamine and methamphetamine without limitation, with the latter, being more addictive, becoming more popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. These drugs were marketed as "Awakening drugs" or "wakeamines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>, with advertisements promoting them for "night work and other times demanding mental alertness" and "over exertion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

## Key Military Applications
Methamphetamine was widely used throughout the Japanese military complex, primarily in tablet form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>:
*   **Sentries** working nighttime duty received a special meth tablet called the "cat eye tablet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
*   **Munitions factory workers** received tablets to enable them to work through the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
*   **Kamikaze and other special forces** were given a special meth tablet mixed with green tea powder and stamped with the emperor's crest, known as the "storming tablet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   **Air Pilots** received meth injections, having been told they were receiving "nighttime vision hormones imported from Germany" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. Post-war records suggest these "hormones" were probably milanotropins extracted from cows and pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

The military stockpiled huge amounts of these meth drugs, referring to them as a "Mainland decisive battle weapon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. Despite this, Japan ultimately lost the war, indicating that methamphetamine did not help them win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

## Post-War Consequences
Many Japanese soldiers simply took their pills home after the war, unaware of the drug's hazardous side effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. This, combined with the military's drug stockpiles leaking into the civilian market and pharmaceutical companies dumping their supplies, contributed to [[Japans postwar methamphetamine crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. The widespread use of methamphetamine in the military thus laid the groundwork for the significant [[postwar_methamphetamine_panic_and_its_societal_effects_in_japan]] that followed [[World War II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

[[Moldovas political and economic corruption | Moldova]] is a small Eastern European nation, recognized as one of the continent's poorest and most corrupt countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Over two decades, politicians enriched businessmen, who then became politicians themselves, seizing control of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This article examines how immense oligarchic wealth came to control the country from behind the scenes, and its eventual downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Post-Soviet Challenges and the Rise of Corruption

After the collapse of the Soviet Union, [[Moldovas political and economic corruption | Moldova]] faced daunting challenges, including a complete redefinition of its identity, economy, and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The ailing economy was in freefall, shrinking by an average of seven percent annually, and the country experienced hyperinflation, with monthly rates of 75 percent in the first half of 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. By late 1992, 79 percent of Moldovans had fallen into poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. The loss of Transnistria, [[Moldovas political and economic corruption | Moldova]]'s most industrialized region, which became *de facto* independent, further exacerbated the economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

To stabilize the situation, the government announced a transition to a functional market economy by 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This plan involved:
*   **Trade Liberalization**: Prices of essential goods were to be market-determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **[[Privatization and economic challenges in postSoviet Moldova | Privatization of State Property]]**: Shares in state-owned firms and land from collective farms were to be distributed to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Despite reforms, economic relief efforts often came too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Inflation persisted until 1994, and salary indexing until 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The [[Privatization and economic challenges in postSoviet Moldova | privatization]] legislation passed in 1991 but only began in 1993 due to political disputes and lack of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

The execution of [[Privatization and economic challenges in postSoviet Moldova | privatization]] was deeply flawed:
*   **Corporate Shares**: Company managers, with insider knowledge, bought shares at extremely low prices or simply pilfered the best assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Agricultural Land**: Distribution started late (1998-2000) and allocated plots without considering land quality or fertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Astute individuals exploited their positions in the land reform scheme to consolidate vast tracts of fertile land, reminiscent of Soviet-era collective farms but now privately owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

Ultimately, state [[Privatization and economic challenges in postSoviet Moldova | privatization]] schemes failed to achieve their goals, instead enriching a select group of connected individuals and creating a class of oligarchs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. By 1997, [[Moldovas political and economic corruption | Moldova]]'s GDP had plummeted to just 35 percent of its 1987 level, and over 50 percent of the population still lived in poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. The black market accounted for 70 percent of the country's livelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. By 2005, 20 percent of the population had emigrated, with personal remittances becoming a major source of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. A 2000 poll found that 91 percent of people were dissatisfied with their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

## The Communist Return and the Rise of Voronin

In 2001, the Communist Party of [[Moldovas political and economic corruption | Moldova]], led by Vladimir Voronin, returned to power, winning 49.9 percent of the vote and 71 of 101 parliamentary seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. They appealed to nostalgia for the Soviet era, promising free healthcare and closer ties with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. They were the only post-Soviet Communist party to regain power after the Soviet collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

Once in power, the Communist Party consolidated its rule, leveraging its disciplined organizational base inherited from Soviet times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Voronin initially attempted to align the country with Russia, but domestic and international pushback thwarted these efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. By 2005, Voronin pivoted, proposing [[Moldovas political and economic corruption | Moldova]]'s entry into the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

The 2000s became a decade of rampant theft and corruption, as party politicians infiltrated the economy and enriched themselves and their families, primarily by transferring public assets to private hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Voronin's son, Oleg, notably headed a business empire spanning banking, construction, and railway, receiving over 2,000 rich government contracts during his father's eight years in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Oleg is considered [[Moldovas political and economic corruption | Moldova]]'s first billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

## Vladimir Plahotniuc: The Ultimate Oligarch

During Voronin's presidency, a businessman named Vladimir Plahotniuc became one of his closest advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Plahotniuc's background is complex; he worked as an economist in the early 1990s before beginning wine exports to Russia in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. By 2001, he was vice chairman of Victoria Bank, one of [[Moldovas political and economic corruption | Moldova]]'s largest banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. By the end of the 2000s, Plahotniuc was worth an estimated $2 billion, making him the richest man in the country, amidst 70 billionaires whose combined wealth represented 138 percent of [[Moldovas political and economic corruption | Moldova]]'s reported GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

In 2009, after the Communist Party lost power in elections tainted by accusations of rigging and followed by the "Twitter Revolution" protests, Plahotniuc defected from the Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. He joined the nominally European-oriented Democratic Party of [[Moldovas political and economic corruption | Moldova]] and quickly came to dominate it, leveraging his wealth and control over a media company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

## Oligarchs in Politics: Plahotniuc and Filat

The period saw businessmen directly entering [[Political influence and government ties | politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. For the next five years, Plahotniuc shared power with Vlad Filat, another Moldovan billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Filat amassed wealth through illegal trading with Romania and by purchasing state assets while serving as State Secretary for [[Privatization and economic challenges in postSoviet Moldova | privatization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. After the Communists came to power, Filat founded the Liberal Democratic Party of [[Moldovas political and economic corruption | Moldova]] and became Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

Plahotniuc and Filat, needing each other for a parliamentary majority, carved up the government into their own fiefdoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Filat controlled financial regulators and the Ministry of Economy, while Plahotniuc solidified control over the judiciary and law enforcement, which proved to be a crucial weapon against his rival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

A December 2012 illegal hunting trip scandal, in which a bystander was shot and killed, led Filat to attempt to oust the prosecutor general, a member of Plahotniuc's faction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Plahotniuc retaliated with a series of anti-corruption drives, dissolving their uneasy alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

### The "Robbery of the Century"

In November 2014, an even larger scandal erupted: three Moldovan banks were taken over and forced to issue nearly $3 billion in bad loans, equivalent to about 15 percent of the country's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. The money was laundered through shell companies to Latvian banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. When the loans defaulted, the banks collapsed, and the Moldovan national central bank secretly bailed them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. To cover this secret bailout, the Ministry of Finance was forced to issue $1 billion in 25-year bonds, burdening Moldovan taxpayers for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. The Moldovan currency devalued by over 40 percent, causing inflation to skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

This sophisticated scheme, masterminded by Israeli-born Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shore, was dubbed the "robbery of the century" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. Over 100,000 people protested against corruption, the largest demonstration since independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. Ilan Shore was arrested and, in exchange for leniency, implicated former Prime Minister Vlad Filat, who was subsequently arrested for corruption and sentenced to prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

## Plahotniuc's State Capture and Eventual Fall

With Filat removed, Plahotniuc moved to formally become Prime Minister but was rejected by the president on integrity grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Despite his failure to gain the premiership, Plahotniuc became the richest and most powerful man in [[Moldovas political and economic corruption | Moldova]], with a fortune exceeding 30 percent of the country's GDP ($2.2 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. His network of family and associates controlled state-owned companies, financial flows, and four out of five of the country's TV stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. By the mid-to-late 2010s, public trust in the government had evaporated, with an 80 percent disapproval rating for the country's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. Plahotniuc himself had a 95 percent disapproval rating and a two percent trust rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

For three years, Plahotniuc effectively captured the state, controlling media, the judiciary, and attempting electoral reforms to solidify his power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. Although his party was nominally pro-European, Plahotniuc lacked a specific ideology, backing figures like the pro-Russian populist Socialist Party leader Igor Dodon for president in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. His primary motivation was personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

In February 2019, parliamentary elections resulted in a hung parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. The major winners were the pro-European Acum alliance (anti-Plahotniuc), Dodon's pro-Russian Socialist Party, Plahotniuc's Democratic Party, and Ilan Shore's party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. Unexpectedly, Acum and the Socialists formed an alliance, reportedly after Dodon's patrons in Russia forbade an alliance with Plahotniuc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. This unlikely coalition, backed by the EU, US, and Russia, formed a government in June 2019, with Acum's Maia Sandu as Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

Plahotniuc attempted to obstruct this new government, literally cutting power to the Parliament building and having the Constitutional Court invalidate the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. However, unified international pressure forced the Constitutional Court to reverse its decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. The Democratic Party conceded power, and Plahotniuc fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[Moldovas political and economic corruption | Moldova]]'s difficult [[History of Moldova and its Soviet past | Soviet past]] left it ethnically divided and struggling through a threefold transition in governance, economy, and national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. These divisions inadvertently facilitated the rise of an oligarch who captured the state for personal financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. Despite the dramatic ousting of Plahotniuc, [[Moldovas political and economic corruption | Moldova]] remains a profoundly poor and corrupt society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Reversing decades of poorly executed policies and widespread corruption will require significant time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

India stands as a formidable force in semiconductor design, with nearly every major semiconductor company maintaining a presence in the country for designing advanced chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, once these designs are finalized, they are sent to the United States, China, South Korea, or Taiwan for fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This highlights India's significant challenge: its inability to fabricate the chips it designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Early Ambitions and Initial Progress

In the 1980s, the Indian government sought to emulate the success of nations like [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts|China]], Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, and Singapore by establishing its own national champion for semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This effort led to the founding of Semiconductor Complex Limited (SCL) in 1984 as a 100% state-owned enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. SCL aimed to design and manufacture leading-edge circuits, envisioning itself as the cornerstone of a native Indian electronics industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

SCL showed promising initial progress by acquiring manufacturing technology:
*   **Technology Acquisition** SCL licensed 5-micron process technology from American Microsystems Inc. (AMI) at its founding in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Partnerships** The company secured process technology from Rockwell to produce its 2560G microprocessor and from Hitachi for electronic wristwatch components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. They also assembled the BBC Acorn computer for the Indian government's computer literacy program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Rapid Advancement** Through these agreements and university partnerships, SCL quickly advanced from the 5-micron process to a 0.8-micron process in the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

At this point, SCL was only one [[impact_of_generational_shifts_in_the_semiconductor_industry|semiconductor generation]] behind leading companies like NTT, Toshiba, and Intel, which achieved 0.8 microns (or 800 nanometers) in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This suggested that India could achieve its goal of becoming a global semiconductor manufacturer within a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Setback and Widening Gap

These hopes were dashed in 1989 when a devastating fire broke out at SCL, the cause of which remains unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Fires are a common cause of operational losses in the semiconductor industry due to flammable chemicals, leading to toxic gases and corrosive damage from sprinkler systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The incident was a significant setback for India's semiconductor manufacturing efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

It took SCL eight years and over $50 million to restart production in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. During this crucial period, new entrants like TSMC (founded in 1987) and Samsung rapidly emerged, capturing critical global market share and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. India lost an immense amount of progress during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Persistent Financial and Operational Challenges

SCL's offerings struggled to be competitive even within the domestic Indian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. The company relied heavily on government contracts and could not achieve economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. For example, in 2005-2006, SCL produced only 1,000 6-inch wafers, despite having 20 times that installed capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This led to significant financial losses; in its final year as a commercial entity (2005-2006), SCL generated $3.5 million in revenue but incurred a loss of $2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

### Modern-Day SCL and Sluggish Development

SCL was restructured in 2005 as an R&D center within the Department of Space, effectively ending its pursuit of being a competitive commercial entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Today, SCL primarily conducts R&D work using its old 6-inch wafer fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

In 2019, SCL announced its capability to accept chip designs at the 180-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. While this is nowhere near the leading edge, older nodes still have viable commercial applications, as exemplified by SkyWater Technologies, an American foundry operating at a 130-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The critical issue for SCL is the extremely sluggish pace of development; it took nearly a decade to reach the 180-nanometer node, having worked on it since at least 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry|Challenges]] and Failed Revival Attempts

The sheer amount of capital required to build competitive and productive fabs is cited as the most significant obstacle for India in establishing a viable semiconductor manufacturing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Today's leading-edge chip factories can cost tens of billions of dollars, a trend that significantly ramped up at the 14-nanometer node generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

To put this in perspective:
*   Reliance Jio spent $15 billion USD on its nationwide LTE data network over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   TSMC will spend $20 billion USD on just one gigafab over two years and is currently building three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

This massive investment must pay for itself, which is not always guaranteed in the [[the_volatility_of_the_semiconductor_industry|volatile electronics world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

Despite these [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry|challenges]], the Indian government has repeatedly attempted to revive its semiconductor manufacturing efforts, though all have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>:
*   **2006 Fab City Project** A $3 billion project was announced, with AMD initially interested in an assembly and test facility, but it was shut down due to poor industry conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **2013 Customs Duties Lifted** The government removed custom duties on imports of semiconductor manufacturing parts and machinery, but this did not stimulate foundry efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **2014 Fab Proposals** Two investor groups proposed building fabs totaling $10 billion, with substantial government financial support (25% of total cost, interest-free loans, tax breaks, and subsidies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
    *   One consortium, including JP Associates, Israel's Tower Jazz, and IBM, pulled out in 2016 due to debt and the perceived commercial unviability of a semiconductor plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
    *   The second consortium, led by Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (HSMC) with expertise from STMicroelectronics and Siltera, also failed, with the government canceling its letter of intent in 2019 due to a lack of commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This mirrors a similar "lack of execution" seen with China's Hongshing Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (HSMC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

## Current State and Geopolitical Implications

India retains world-class chip design capabilities, with tens of thousands of Indian engineers working in VLSI design, and major fabless chip companies have a presence in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. However, since the mid-1980s, chip design and manufacturing have largely separated, and few companies or economies are capable of doing both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

As of the current writing, 100% of India's chips—logic, memory, and all others—must be imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. In 2019, India imported $21 billion worth of semiconductors, a number growing at about 15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. The 2020 worldwide semiconductor shortage severely disrupted critical Indian businesses, including its position as the world's second-largest smartphone maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

A significant portion of these imports (37% or $7 billion in 2019) comes from [[implications_of_chinese_semiconductor_advancements|China]], leading to critical [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_and_geopolitical_tensions|geopolitical repercussions]] given the tense Sino-Indian relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

In conclusion, while India possesses abundant human talent and ideas for re-establishing semiconductor manufacturing, it desperately needs consistent, long-term direction and substantial financial commitment from the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. The market has long passed the point where a private entity can seed a thriving semiconductor manufacturing industry without external support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

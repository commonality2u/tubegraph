MicroElectroMechanical Systems, or MEMS, are microsystems that combine both electric and mechanical functions. They are built using the same advanced techniques used to create today's integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Imagine a tiny speaker, smaller than a penny, made entirely out of silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. MEMS are ubiquitous, found everywhere around us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## [[historical_development_of_mems_technology | Historical Development of MEMS]]

The dream of making things extremely small has a long history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. In 1959, Richard Feynman delivered a lecture at Caltech titled "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom," where he discussed directly manipulating atoms to create useful tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. He even offered a $1,000 prize for a tiny motor fitting into a 0.4 mm cube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

The first true MEMS product emerged in 1967 when Harvey Nathanson at Westinghouse used pre-modern micro-machining techniques to develop the resonant gate transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This gold transistor, about one millimeter long, could move using electricity, allowing researchers to control the distance between its gate and electrode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Its ability to respond to a narrow range of input signals made it useful as a frequency filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## [[commercial_applications_of_mems_in_industry_sectors | Commercial Applications]]

MEMS technology gained significant commercial traction in 1979 when Hewlett-Packard utilized silicon micro-machining to create printer inkjet nozzles for thermal inkjet technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. These nozzles rapidly heat ink to about 100 degrees Celsius, creating bubbles that push ink onto paper; when the bubbles collapse, a vacuum draws in more ink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. While the nozzles themselves don't move, MEMS technology facilitated their creation, and their tiny size allowed HP to integrate many of them to boost printer resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

The 1990s saw another major commercial use for the MEMS industry: sensors for acceleration, pressure, and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. These sensors are valuable across industrial, medical, and electronics sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Automotive Airbag Sensors

Early automotive airbag sensors were large, heavy, complex, and expensive mechanical devices, costing hundreds of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. In 1991, Analog Devices introduced the first commercial acceleration MEMS sensor, less than one square centimeter in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This sensor features capacitive sense fingers, about 60 microns deep, attached to a mass that moves upon acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This movement changes the capacitive value, which the chip senses and relays to the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Analog Devices integrated this accelerometer with its accompanying electronics onto a single silicon chip, the ADXL50, capable of sensing accelerations up to 50 Gs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This monolithic system was smaller, more reliable, and significantly cheaper to produce ($5 compared to $20-$100 for older systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. These MEMS-based accelerometer sensors played a crucial role in the widespread adoption of airbags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Modern cars now incorporate dozens of MEMS-based sensor devices for anti-lock brakes, active suspension, navigation control, and rollover detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Over 60 million MEMS-based airbag sensors alone have been sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Medical Pressure Sensors

The next major application for MEMS technology was pressure sensors, used to monitor blood pressure in hospitals by connecting to a patient's intravenous line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Earlier external blood pressure sensors cost over $600 and required sterilization and recalibration for each reuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The MEMS version drastically reduced the cost to just $10, with the majority of the cost attributed to packaging that made it disposable and simpler to use in medical settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Mechanically, these sensors are straightforward: silicon is crafted into a thin membrane acting as a diaphragm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Four small, stress-sensitive polysilicon resistors (piezoresistors) are placed along the diaphragm's edges, which is then suspended over a vacuum cavity to form an absolute pressure sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. When pressure is applied, it alters the silicon band structure and changes the crystal's resistivity, which is then sensed and signals are delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Today, the medical MEMS-based sensor industry is valued at over six billion dollars, with blood pressure sensors being the largest segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Consumer Electronics

Manufacturers have built upon initial pressure sensor and accelerometer designs to create versatile, low-power inertial MEMS-based sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. These sensors are integrated into today's popular consumer electronics. For example, the Nintendo Switch console and controllers contain ultra-low-power inertial sensors with gyroscope and accelerometer capabilities, such as the STMicroelectronics SH-627 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

MEMS micro-machining technologies are also used in other consumer electronics products, including visual displays and optical switches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Optical switches employ micro-mirrors to redirect light from one optical fiber to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Other Potential Applications

The MEMS industry holds exciting possibilities for the future, including:
*   Micropropulsion technologies for small CubeSats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>
*   MEMS-based lidar mirrors for autonomous cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>
*   IoT sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>

## [[design_and_manufacturing_processes_of_mems | Design and Manufacturing]]

The general approach for most [[commercial_applications_of_mems_in_industry_sectors | commercial MEMS]] production involves using high-volume integrated circuit (IC) techniques, such as photolithography and etching, to add or remove layers on a 2D substrate until a 3D shape is produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. However, there isn't a universal "one-size-fits-all" manufacturing methodology for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Companies have explored alternative methods like electrochemical micro-machining (ECM), laser beam machining, electrode discharge machining, and LIGA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

Despite similarities, MEMS and ICs differ significantly:
*   **Design**: Designing MEMS is specialized. Simply miniaturizing objects does not guarantee functionality, as forces like friction are much stronger than inertia at the micro-scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Unlike VLSI, which revolutionized semiconductor design with modular approaches and standardized cell libraries, mechanical design lacks such a universal library <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Mechanical components are custom-tailored to specific product needs, accommodating weight, space, and energy restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. While ICs primarily process signals, mechanical objects must contain liquids, rotate, slide, or support loads, often simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Companies like CoventorWare and IntelliSuite are developing CAD and design automation software for the MEMS industry to help designers understand microstructure design and electromechanical behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Packaging**: Testing and packaging, known as the back-end of the semiconductor production process, are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. For MEMS sensors, packaging accounts for 75% to 80% of the final cost, a significant contrast to integrated chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. For example, an HVAC pressure sensor priced at $20-$30 has packaging as its primary cost component, while the raw die from a foundry costs less than 50 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This is because MEMS must intimately interact with the outside world (e.g., a pressure sensor cannot be in a hard plastic case), requiring custom packaging for each specific die and application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

## [[challenges_in_mems_production_and_economic_issues | Challenges in the MEMS Industry]]

The MEMS industry, despite its technological marvels, has faced significant economic struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Analog Devices, an early investor in MEMS for airbag sensors, built an in-house manufacturing facility that took nine years to become profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. A major issue is pricing: when Analog Devices signed its first automotive sensor deal, it had to incorporate automatic price declines over six years, from $11 to $6 per unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

*   **Yield and Cost**: Yield is the most significant factor influencing product cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. A 10% yield means 9 out of 10 MEMS products are unusable, and doubling the yield can halve the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. However, achieving high yields is challenging, leading to overly optimistic projections and market prices that do not reflect the substantial investment in development, production, packaging, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **Price Erosion**: Relentless market price erosion, as high as 3-5% per quarter, erodes margins and discourages investment in potentially exciting new MEMS applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Lack of Standardization**: The industry's creativity and diversity make it difficult to establish widespread standards, unlike other semiconductor sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. There is no equivalent of a SEMATECH or DARPA working to map a way forward within the MEMS industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

Despite these challenges, MEMS is considered a "second silicon revolution," offering microscopic moving parts that are smaller, cheaper, and perform better than their larger counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. For the industry to fully realize its technical and commercial potential, the various players—designers, foundries, vendors, and end-users—need to collaborate more closely to establish standards and address under-invested issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

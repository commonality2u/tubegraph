Deindustrialization, specifically the loss of Hong Kong's electronics manufacturing industry, is argued to have been a significant mistake for the Hong Kong economy [00:00:22]. This shift resulted in an entire economy losing its capacity to produce tangible goods [00:00:29].

## The Rise of Manufacturing in Hong Kong

After the Chinese Civil War, industrialists from Shanghai, along with numerous refugees, moved to Hong Kong to escape the Communist Party of China [00:01:01]. These industrialists brought capital and manufacturing expertise, re-establishing factories to leverage the labor opportunities provided by the large number of Chinese migrants in Hong Kong [00:01:10]. Due to limited land, factories produced lightly manufactured items in high-rise buildings, such as plastic flowers, clothes, and radio assemblies [00:01:27].

Hong Kong's manufacturing industry emerged at an opportune time. Starting in the 1950s, the United States and other Western nations began sourcing manufactured goods from Asia, a trend of outsourcing that intensified over time [00:01:42]. By the early 1960s, Hong Kong became the largest manufacturer in the developing world, providing low-skilled jobs that helped its population make a living and build wealth [00:01:56].

## Challenges and Decline of Manufacturing

However, [[impact_of_competition_from_china_and_other_asian_economies_on_hong_kong | competition emerged out of places like South Korea or Taiwan]] [00:02:10]. Costs increased as worker salaries improved, and new generations of Hong Kongers sought a richer lifestyle [00:02:15]. Hong Kong's manufacturing industries had little to offer beyond cheap labor, lacking technological expertise to produce native technologies for critical components [00:02:28]. For example, in electronics, Hong Kong's OEMs spent 60% of their budget on integrated circuits imported from Japan [00:02:44]. This made the industry uncompetitive [00:02:53]. By 1981, manufacturers were seeking government assistance for technological upgrades [00:02:56]. In contrast, governments in Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea invested heavily in acquiring and "naturalizing" technologies for commercial use [00:03:06].

## British Colonial Rule and Economic Policy

Hong Kong's unique [[economic_history_and_policies_during_british_colonial_rule_in_hong_kong | economic history]] played a crucial role [00:03:24]. The [[economic_history_and_policies_during_british_colonial_rule_in_hong_kong | British colonial administration]] likely intended Hong Kong to be primarily a small trading post between China and the West [00:03:28]. Early on, the Hong Kong government and trading houses agreed on a fiscal model with no import or export taxes, instead relying on land revenue [00:03:38]. The government maintains superior title to all land, leasing it to private parties [00:03:49]. This system incentivized an economy focused on rising land prices and trading, both financial and otherwise [00:03:55].

By 1949, Hong Kong's largest companies were banks, land development companies, and trading houses [00:04:02]. Many industrialists, such as Li Ka-shing, closed their factories to become landlords, seeing it as more profitable [00:04:10]. These powerful companies saw no reason for government intervention to support manufacturing [00:04:18]. Consequently, the Hong Kong government adopted a non-interventionist stance, leading manufacturing to relocate, primarily to mainland China [00:04:24].

## The Shift to a Service Economy

This resulted in a massive loss of lower and middle-income jobs in Hong Kong, as the city increasingly focused on finance and trading [00:04:32]. Hong Kong's economy stopped making and exporting goods, instead serving as a value-added intermediary for investments and cargo between international companies and China [00:04:42]. Its British heritage, English language, laws, and pro-business attitudes facilitated this role [00:04:57].

The [[the_shift_from_manufacturing_to_service_industries_in_hong_kong | shift from manufacturing to service industries in Hong Kong]] was dramatic:
*   In 1980, the service industry contributed 68% of Hong Kong's GDP [00:05:04].
*   This rose to 86.5% by 2000 [00:05:10].
*   By 2019, it reached 93.4% [00:05:12].
*   Construction is the second biggest sector [00:05:17].

Hong Kong Chief Executives, like Tung Chee-hwa and Donald Tsang, did not attempt to reverse deindustrialization, instead promoting the idea that Hong Kong benefited most from the free flow of capital and trade between China and the West [00:05:27].

## Consequences of Deindustrialization

The problem with this view is that as China reforms and opens up, Hong Kong's service economy model becomes less critical [00:05:42]. The Pearl River region has become a top logistics and transport center [00:05:52], and cities like Shanghai have taken on many of Hong Kong's service economy functions [00:05:57]. Mainland Chinese cities have also reformed financial restrictions, allowing foreign capital to flow directly into their ports and logistics networks [00:06:03].

Hong Kong's role in China's trade has significantly declined:
*   1997: Handled 60% of China's trade [00:06:11].
*   2007: Declined to 28% [00:06:16].
*   2020: Just 10% [00:06:19].

With transport, trade, and logistics declining, the financial services sector has been Hong Kong's primary growth engine [00:06:22]. In 2000, finance, insurance, and real estate contributed 18% of the economy; by 2019, this grew to nearly 30% [00:06:30]. However, even this sector faces increasing competition as China lifts foreign ownership restrictions on its investing and banking markets [00:06:44]. For instance, in 2020, China allowed foreign banks to wholly own their Chinese subsidiaries, and later, the same applied to securities and fund management firms [00:06:53]. This allows foreign companies like BlackRock to offer financial products directly to Chinese consumers [00:07:03].

## Challenges for Young People and the Labor Market

The shift has created significant [[challenges_facing_young_people_and_the_labor_market_in_hong_kong | challenges for young people]] in Hong Kong regarding wealth and economic security [00:07:54]. Property prices are "obscene," far outpacing wage growth, making homeownership unattainable for most [[challenges_facing_young_people_and_the_labor_market_in_hong_kong | young Hong Kongers]] [00:08:03]. The government's inability to control interest rates (due to the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar) [00:08:20] and the locking up of undeveloped land by major land development monopolies like Sun Hung Kai Properties and CK Hutchison Holdings Limited [00:08:32] exacerbate the housing crisis. Attempts at housing price reform in the 1990s failed [00:08:44], and public spending for housing as a percentage of GDP has not increased since 2005 [00:09:02].

The government's current policy vision appears to be centered on labor flexibility, high-tech industries, and wealth building through investment [00:09:16]. However, this individual financial advice breaks down as public policy [00:09:38]:
*   **Job Creation**: The financial sector, while important, provides less than 10% of the city's jobs [00:10:02]. Nearly 85% of Hong Kong's adult population works in large service-oriented companies (supermarkets, utilities, business services) [00:10:17], a stagnant sector dominated by anti-competitive land developer conglomerates [00:10:31].
*   **Wage Inequality**: This leads to massive and growing wage inequality, with many service workers being over-educated for their jobs and having few career upgrading prospects [00:10:47].

## Government Efforts and the Paradox of Financialization

The government has begun to change its approach since 2016, realizing the need to open new career pathways for youth [00:11:35]. They have identified emerging industries to develop a knowledge-based economy, including:
*   Cultural and creative industries (games, software) [00:11:51].
*   Medical services (medical tourism) [00:11:55].
*   Education services [00:11:58].
*   Testing and certification (for Pearl River area companies) [00:12:09].
*   Innovation and technology, which is seen as a powerful growth engine for young people [00:12:15].

Despite these efforts, a major problem lies with the assets the government encourages people to invest in [00:12:32]. Policies promoting stock ownership have increased participation in the Hong Kong stock markets [00:12:43], which have become a destination for Chinese companies like Didi and Alibaba fleeing American capital markets [00:12:51]. However, giving everyone a stock exchange account may not help the lower classes achieve wealth or financial stability [00:12:59]. A 2015 survey found that the average Hong Kong retail stock investor was 47 years old and already made substantially more than the average household income, indicating that stocks are a way to "stay rich, not get rich" [00:13:08].

Furthermore, Hong Kong stocks have shown lagging performance compared to international benchmarks, such as the S&P 500 [00:13:27]. This is partly because many listed companies operate within the city, and to become more shareholder-friendly, they might resort to actions like mass layoffs and moving workers into non-standard employment, increasing economic burdens and insecurity for residents [00:14:04].

Because Hong Kong real estate became too expensive for the average person to invest in directly, the city's government and financial sector have packaged public assets into investable vehicles for investors [00:14:31]. While this has benefited certain segments of the population, it has come at a long-term detriment to others [00:14:45]:
*   **MTR Privatization**: In 2000, the Hong Kong MTR was partially privatized [00:14:56]. After privatization, it stopped receiving free land grants and focused more on profitable land management, advertising, and telecom services rather than extending its railway networks [00:15:08].
*   **Link REIT**: The government sold the car parking and retail facilities of its public housing complexes to a real estate investment trust called The Link [00:15:56]. This IPO, subscribed by retail investors, valued The Link at up to five times its IPO price, and The Link subsequently raised rents on tenants, causing economic hardship [00:16:19].

## Conclusion

The decision to demanufacture its economy and double down on services and finance has undoubtedly generated significant wealth for many in Hong Kong, with the city's GDP never being higher [00:16:35]. However, the speaker argues that it was a mistake [00:00:24], as Hong Kong could have maintained a sophisticated manufacturing sector in addition to its service economy [00:17:16]. There was an opportunity for the electronics industry to ascend the technology ladder, potentially leading to something like a "Hong Kong TSMC" given its ties with the West at the time [00:17:22].

Instead, Hong Kong ceased producing goods that others wanted, turning its public goods and even its people into investable assets or cash flow streams [00:17:42]. This has come at a considerable cost to the majority poor population, who now see no clear path to economic improvement [00:17:57]. This serves as a lesson in economic diversification [00:18:02].

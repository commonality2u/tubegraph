Japan experienced a digital trade deficit of approximately 5.5 trillion yen (about $37 billion USD) in 2023, indicating a significant import of software licenses, cloud services, and other digital services compared to its exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This deficit has been growing, doubling from 2015 to 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Despite iconic electronics hardware companies like Sony, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Panasonic, Canon, Sharp, and Toshiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, Japan lacks globally recognized software giants akin to Microsoft, Oracle, Adobe, or SAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This article explores [[the_history_of_japans_computer_and_software_industry | how Japan lost the software industry]].

## Beginnings

Throughout the 20th century, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) aimed to develop the nation's computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. A primary concern was [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]], which established IBM Japan in 1937, though its assets were confiscated during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Upon IBM's return in 1949, a new Japanese law mandated that foreign computer companies enter joint ventures with local firms, essentially forcing technology transfers (e.g., RCA with Hitachi, GE with Toshiba, Honeywell with NEC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. IBM, however, maintained 100% ownership of IBM Japan despite government demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. MITI and IBM Japan frequently clashed over market introductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, with Japanese officials pushing customers to buy local products and leveraging import licenses to enforce this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Despite these pressures, Japanese customers favored IBM products due to their technical superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Japan Software

In 1964, IBM introduced its System/360 computer line, alarming MITI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This prompted MITI to sponsor the Super High-Performance Computer Project (1966-1971) to compete with the System/360 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Unlike previous efforts that focused solely on hardware, the System/360's emphasis on software compatibility across its line meant software could no longer be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

To develop software for this project, MITI sponsored the Japan Software Company in October 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This joint venture included Hitachi, NEC, Fujitsu, and the Industrial Bank of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Its objective was to produce "common language" software and standards for the project, aiming for a universal operating system for all Japanese computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. However, MITI only funded Japan Software with 25% of the project's 10 billion yen budget, indicating software was an afterthought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The company failed to achieve its goals due to ballooning requirements, lack of outside sales, and loss of employee confidence, leading to its closure in 1972 after government subsidies ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Unbundling and "Little IBMs"

In 1969, facing an American anti-trust lawsuit, IBM unbundled its software and hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Previously, software was included as part of an overall computing services bundle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This unbundling assigned a price to what was once free and allowed smaller software companies to compete against giants like IBM, giving rise to the modern software industry in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

In Japan, however, IBM's unbundling allowed Japanese computer manufacturers to establish software subsidiaries and "adopt" IBM's specifications through reverse-engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. As early as 1971, Fujitsu began selling an "IBM-compatible" mainframe that was faster and cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Japanese computer companies often modified this software to display Japanese kanji symbols and to fit existing business practices, which locked in customers and allowed for higher charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This led to Japanese companies becoming "little IBMs," a strategy that arguably allowed them to survive despite persistent technological lags against American firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## The IBM Spy Case

The reverse-engineering and use of IBM software by Japanese companies was illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. IBM initially did little, partly because definitive copyright protections for software weren't established until the Copyright Act of 1976 took effect in 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Also, IBM was preoccupied with a major anti-trust case until 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Once the anti-trust case was resolved, IBM confronted Fujitsu, Hitachi, and other Japanese companies with allegations of software theft in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Japanese firms argued that the System/360 OS was in the public domain when they adopted it, and that IBM's software specifications were so widely used they constituted a standard not subject to copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. In response, IBM involved the US government, leading to the "IBM Spy Case" in 1982, where 18 Japanese employees from Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric were arrested in a sting operation for attempting to steal IBM's technical secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This case sparked tensions between the US and Japan during a period of economic insecurity for both nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Ultimately, Japanese computer firms were found to have copied IBM's work, even its errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Fujitsu settled, paying a lump sum and annual licensing fees of up to $60 million, agreeing to respect IBM's intellectual property rights going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

## The Japanese Software Crisis

These software fees seriously threatened the competitiveness of Japanese computer manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. In 1985, MITI even proposed amending copyright laws to limit software protection from 50 to 15 years, though this failed to take hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. It became clear that Japan's reliance on closed-source foreign software was problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

The Japanese government recognized a serious "software crisis," understanding that without domestic alternatives, Japanese tech providers would remain dependent on software imports from companies like IBM or Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. A major obstacle was a persistent shortage of qualified programmers in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>:
*   **Education**: Japanese universities lacked enough qualified computer science teachers, and professors often lagged in adopting the latest computing trends, partly due to a lack of English bilingual abilities and overseas experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Job Attractiveness**: Software engineering was not seen as an attractive job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The largest employers were software development arms of [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan | larger business families]] operating on a lifetime employment system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Developers lacked career progression, faced low pay, and performed mostly unfulfilling customization or maintenance work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. In 2010, an estimated 80% of Japan's software spending went to maintaining existing systems, compared to no more than 60% in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Lack of Startups**: Unlike the United States, which saw the emergence of independent software giants like Adobe, Intuit, Synopsys, Cadence, Microsoft, and Oracle in the 1980s, such companies largely failed to emerge in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This was attributed to a lack of customer acceptance or insufficient venture capital, an unwieldy lifetime employment system, and a cultural lack of initiative or risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. [[the_challenges_faced_by_japanese_software_startups | These challenges]] limited the dynamism that startups could bring to the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## BTRON

A contributing factor to Japan's software struggles was the lack of a good "software environment" or a widely accepted, hardware-independent operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. One potential solution was TRON, a domestic OS project initiated in 1984 by Dr. Ken Sakamura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. TRON aimed to create an "open" operating system to counter the growing dominance of Microsoft's software and Intel's hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Its most significant variant, Business TRON (BTRON), was adopted by PC makers like Matsushita Electric for use in Japanese schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

However, in April 1989, the US Trade Representative office listed BTRON as a potential Japanese trade barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Although the mention was later removed, the damage was done. Japanese microprocessor companies, already embroiled in the [[impact_of_the_american_and_japanese_semiconductor_industries_on_europe | US-Japan semiconductor kerfuffle]], withdrew their support, leading to BTRON's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. While TRON technology found niche applications, such as in Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers and the Hayabusa2 space probe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, BTRON's lack of applications and general slowness likely contributed to its ultimate failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

## SIGMA & Unix

In 1985, MITI launched the five-year, 25 billion yen Software Industrialized Generators and Maintenance Aids (SIGMA) project, aiming to drastically improve programmer productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. SIGMA focused on developing standards and applications for networked Unix workstation computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Although it fell short of its grand goals, SIGMA did prompt Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC to transition from their old IBM platforms to Unix, licensed from AT&T <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. However, in classic Japanese fashion, they heavily customized Unix (e.g., Fujitsu with UTS/M, NEC with Super-UX, Hitachi with Hi-UX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This shift provided a "second wind" in mainframes and supercomputers, with Japan producing some of the world's fastest supercomputers in the 1990s, but it remained a niche success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

## The 1990s

The popping of Japan's real estate bubble in 1990 led to a prolonged recession, which meant customers could no longer afford expensive software modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Major Japanese mainframe makers like Fujitsu and Hitachi struggled to adapt and entered a long-term decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. The crisis shook Japanese confidence and challenged MITI's long-held principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

MITI's traditional playbook—funding domestic champions to reverse-engineer popular products and produce them cheaper for export—worked well for industrial goods like steel and automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. However, software's success relies not on "replication economics" but on widely held standards, networks of applications or users, and consumer familiarity, making this approach ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. As consumer products became increasingly reliant on software, Japan's mighty consumer companies found it harder to compete in the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

### PC-98 & I-Mode

The personal computer illustrates Japan's missteps in software-heavy consumer electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. For over a decade, NEC dominated the domestic PC market with its PC-98, a hardware-accelerated MS-DOS version capable of handling Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. However, in the early 1990s, IBM, Microsoft, and Intel broke NEC's monopoly when a new DOS version with Japanese language support allowed foreign software and hardware to enter the Japanese market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This time, the Japanese government and MITI adopted a more globalized approach, leading to the collapse of NEC's overpriced PC-98 products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. While beneficial for consumers, this cemented Microsoft's domination of the Japanese market, with no domestic Japanese software maker mounting a creditable challenge since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

A similar situation occurred with I-mode, a mobile 2G web browser developed by Japanese telecom NTT DoCoMo, launched in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. It gained over 40 million subscribers by 2003, and NTT attempted to export the standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. However, I-mode failed to gain traction abroad, partly due to a lack of adoption by handset partners, and its window of opportunity closed with the release of the iPhone and its rich application ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

## Conclusion

Japan does have a substantial software industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. However, [[japans_digital_trade_deficit_and_software_imports | its software landscape]] is primarily dominated by custom-made packages with limited broader sale potential or imported products developed abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Despite its industrial policies, Japan's brightest spot in software is arguably gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. While the talent side has improved, with Japanese software programmers being highly skilled, the nation's continued lag in the global software industry remains a persistent topic of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

Taiwan has been experiencing one of its most severe droughts in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While the northwestern areas, including Taipei and New Taipei City, generally have sufficient reservoirs, other regions such as Tainan, Kaohsiung, Taitung, and Hsinchu face significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These issues stem from less resilient water infrastructure or higher water demand in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Impact on Semiconductor Industry
The [[impact_of_semiconductor_industry_on_local_water_resources | semiconductor manufacturing]] industry, a major part of Taiwan's economy, is a significant water consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. TSMC, a prominent semiconductor manufacturer, has been reported to budget millions of dollars to truck water to its fabrication plants (fabs) in Tainan during the drought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

In 2019, TSMC's fabs in Tainan alone consumed 50,000 metric tons (50 million liters) of water daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The area primarily draws water from the Nan Hua and Zengwen reservoirs, which have experienced dangerously low capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Furthermore, Taiwan's southern region is its agricultural heart, requiring substantial water to feed its population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

Despite advancements in water reuse, the water consumption per chip has increased over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. In 2020, TSMC acknowledged in their corporate social responsibility report that they did not meet their water consumption reduction goals, achieving only a 5% reduction against a target of 27% per 8-inch wafer equivalent layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This shortfall is attributed to increased demands for process cleanliness, as more advanced process nodes require more washing layers, more ultra-pure water, and more stringent purity standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Water Management and Conservation Efforts
To mitigate the impact on regional water supplies, companies like TSMC have optimized their water draw and usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Recycling and Reuse
Large fabs, including TSMC, Samsung, and Intel, must implement water reuse and recycling technologies due to their scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. TSMC's recycle rate in 2017 was 87% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. For context, the average semiconductor fab recycled less than half of that (42%) in a 2017 Singapore study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Innovative Infrastructure
In addition to internal recycling, TSMC has invested in:
*   **Rain collection systems:** Large systems are built to capture rainwater and store it in 700-ton tanks. After processing, this water can be used for landscaping or sent to sewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Water reclamation plants:** The company has signed tenders to build these plants near its fabs. These facilities will recycle industrial wastewater using advanced methods like reverse osmosis, hollow fiber ultrafiltration, and sand filtration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. These procedures are similar to Singapore's "New Water" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. The first facilities are operational in Tainan Science Park, with additional capacity expected from future plants in the Yongkang and Anping areas of Tainan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## Economic and Political Considerations
The semiconductor industry is highly profitable and adds significant value, making governments willing to bear the costs of water infrastructure or reallocate water from other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. A 2012 paper noted that the economic benefits from semiconductor manufacturing outweigh the costs of providing water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Governments are incentivized to attract these facilities due to substantial revenue generation, largely through property taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

Water allocations for farmers have been cut and diverted to tech companies in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Agriculture is the primary water user globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. While there is an argument that much agricultural practice is not economically efficient in terms of water usage, governments must delicately balance these decisions due to the political consequences associated with impacting farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

The semiconductor industry's demand for water is expected to continue growing as Moore's Law pushes for smaller and more complex chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Therefore, continued advancements in water recycling, reduction techniques, and reuse technologies are crucial to ensure sufficient water resources for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

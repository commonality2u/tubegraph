The proposed [[australia_asean_power_link_project | Australia-ASEAN Power Link]] (also known as "Sun Cable") aims to deliver renewable solar energy from Australia to Singapore, addressing Singapore's reliance on natural gas and offering significant economic and energy opportunities for the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Singapore's Energy Needs

Singapore's electricity is 95% sourced from burning natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. As a small island, Singapore lacks space for extensive solar or wind farms, with only a few rooftop solar panels available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This makes importing electricity from overseas an appealing solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Sun Cable Project Overview

The Sun Cable project, developed by a Singaporean company, proposes a ten-gigawatt capacity solar farm spanning 12,000 hectares in Australia's Northern Territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The solar panels would be prefabricated in Australia and assembled on-site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Generated electricity would first travel 500 miles (800 kilometers) to Darwin, Australia, contributing to the city's renewable energy goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The remaining power would be exported to Singapore via an intercontinental 2,300-mile (3,700 kilometers) HVDC (High Voltage Direct Current) underwater power line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. To meet overnight demand, a battery system near the solar farm is proposed to store excess power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The solar farm and battery storage are estimated to cost about $7 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The project is currently in the planning stages, with details subject to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## HVDC Power Transmission

The transmission of electricity over such vast distances, like the 2,300 miles from Australia to Singapore, presents significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### AC vs. DC for Long Distances
Electric current can be Alternating Current (AC) or Direct Current (DC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. While most modern systems are AC due to its efficiency and affordability for transmission over shorter distances using transformers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, high voltage AC systems lose efficiency over long distances due to factors like the "skin effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The skin effect causes AC to flow more densely at the surface of a cable, increasing resistance and power loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

HVDC systems were developed to overcome these shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The first modern HVDC subsea cable was implemented in 1954 in Sweden, linking Gotland island with the mainland over 90 km <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### How HVDC Works
HVDC systems include equipment like converters and inverters to transform AC power to DC and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Although this equipment is expensive, it provides substantially better economics for long-distance power transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The initial terminal cost for DC is higher than AC, but the cost of the line rises faster with AC due to significantly higher energy losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

For instance, a 1,200-mile (2,000 kilometer) AC line can have twice the losses of a DC line even when carrying half the power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The "breakeven distance" where DC becomes more economical than AC is roughly 62 miles (100 kilometers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The Sun Cable's 3,200 kilometers of HVDC cable is estimated to have about 10% electrical loss, which is substantially less than an equivalent HVAC line that could have over twice that loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

HVDC is crucial for making renewable energy sources like offshore wind or hydro economically viable over long distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. It is also ideal for undersea infrastructure where intermediate substations are impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Over 6,000 miles (10,000 kilometers) of subsea HVDC lines exist globally, with 70% in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. An existing Australian example is Basslink, a 230-mile (370 kilometers) HVDC cable connecting Tasmania to Victoria, owned by a Singaporean company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Implementation Challenges

Laying subsea cables requires keeping the cable length as short as possible to reduce cost and maintenance, and avoiding deep trenches and steep slopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Route and Depth
While most existing subsea power cables are laid in relatively shallow depths (under 0.6 miles or 1 kilometer) on flat, silty seabed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, the Sun Cable project faces challenges. Australia is surrounded by steep slopes and deep water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The most practical route would start from Darwin, cross the Timor Sea south of East Timor to Indonesia, pass through Indonesia (e.g., between Bali and Lombok) into the Java Sea, and finally run up to Singapore at Changi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

While much of the route is shallow (less than 600 feet or 200 meters deep), a 700-mile (1,200 kilometer) section south of East Timor in the Timor trough would encounter waters over a mile deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This depth requires special attention, similar to the SA.PE.I cable between Sardinia and mainland Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. For deepwater sections, cables might use lighter materials like aluminum instead of copper, which, while not as good at conducting electricity, allows more cable to be carried and laid per vessel, saving on expensive deepwater ship time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Interference and Manufacturing Capacity
In shallow, busy waterways like the Java Sea and Singapore Strait, engineers will likely need to trench or bury the cable 2-5 feet (0.6-1.5 meters) deep to protect it from fishing nets, boat anchors, and other debris that could cause damage and blackouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

A significant hurdle is the limited global manufacturing capacity for HVDC cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. The Sun Cable proposes using two cables of 3,200 kilometers each, which exceeds the total annual output of all HVDC cable manufacturers in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This means additional money and 3-5 years would be needed to build up manufacturing capacity from various global suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Costs and Funding

The subsea cable portion of the Sun Cable project is projected to cost about $5.6 billion USD before insurance and administrative expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. The cable itself accounts for the majority of this, at $4.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This cost is over six times that of the Basslink cable, which cost $670 million USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. When factoring in the solar farm, the total project cost is likely to exceed $10 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Seed funding for the privately-owned Sun Cable corporation has come from Australian billionaires, but full funding will likely require a multi-decade service agreement between the company and the power purchasing entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Basslink, for example, relies on a 25-year service agreement with Hydro Tasmania for its cash flows, attracting private investors with regular dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. The Basslink project experienced a six-month outage in 2016 and another two-month outage in 2018, leading to a $30 million USD fine against Basslink, highlighting potential risks for large-scale infrastructure projects reliant on public-private partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## Economic and Renewable Energy Implications

### For Southeast Asia
Once fully deployed, the Sun Cable is projected to provide up to 20% of Singapore's energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This project's potential impact extends beyond Singapore, as energy demand from Southeast Asian countries is estimated to expand by 65% from 2015 to 2040, mostly from fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. There is ample demand for clean energy, and Indonesia might also sign on to receive electricity from the cable, as it passes through their waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

### For Australia
The project offers significant gains for Australia. The country's economy is currently heavily dependent on mining, petroleum, and exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. While these vast reserves have brought wealth, they contribute to global climate change concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. The Sun Cable project explores a new energy export paradigm, helping Australia transition away from its [[natural_resource_dependence_and_economic_challenges | natural resource dependence and economic challenges]] on traditional carbon exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

Australia's Northern Territory, larger than Egypt but with a population of less than 250,000, is one of the most solar-irradiated areas globally, presenting significant renewable energy opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. The project will also help cement stronger relationships with Southeast Asian countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

The project is scheduled to come online in 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

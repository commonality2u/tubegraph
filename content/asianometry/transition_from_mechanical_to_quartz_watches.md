The global watch industry underwent a significant [[impact_of_technological_advancements_in_watches | technological transformation]] in the latter half of the 20th century, shifting from predominantly mechanical timepieces to the more accurate and mass-producible quartz watches.

## The Mechanical Watch Landscape

At the time of Japan's opening, nearly all watches worldwide originated from either the United States or [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Switzerland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss sought]] to protect their manufacturing secrets, but this knowledge eventually disseminated, enabling Japan to become a major watch producer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

At the turn of the 20th century, the watch world was divided between the United States and [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Switzerland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:
*   **United States:** Characterized by a small number of large companies, such as Waltham Watch and Elgin Watch, which mass-produced hundreds of thousands of simple, inexpensive pocket watches for domestic consumption using screw automation adapted from sewing machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **[[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Switzerland]]**: Featured many small companies that contributed to a wide range of high-precision timepieces, with a focus on higher-class products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. In 1901, [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss statistics]] recorded 663 watch industry firms employing 24,858 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The largest company, Longines, employed only 853 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> and produced 130,000 pieces in 1905, significantly less than Waltham's annual production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Swiss diversity was a strength, producing many products for export, and [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Switzerland]] dominated the pocket watch export market with approximately 93% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Japan's Entry into Watchmaking
Japan rapidly adopted Western technologies for modernization, including railroads, telegraphs, and military applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. When Westerners first imported watches into Japan in the 1860s, they were considered luxury goods for the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Initially, wall clocks were more prevalent; in 1868, 1,185 wall clocks and 300 pocket watches were imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. By 1887, over 700,000 clocks had entered Japan for installation in public buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Japan sought to reduce its reliance on clock imports from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Since clocks were technologically simpler than watches, the early Japanese clock industry focused on replication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. In 1888, Hayashi Shii, a timepiece retailer, opened Japan's first modern clock factory, which led to the opening of five more factories in Osaka, Tokyo, and other cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The [[history_of_japanese_watch_industry_development | Japanese clock industry]] rapidly gained competence, with production volume increasing from 37,466 pieces in 1905 to 1.2 million in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. By the eve of World War I, there were over 20 clock factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. While domestic and military demand initially drove the market, Hayashi began exporting to cities in the Far East such as Shanghai, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Bombay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. By the 1930s, Japan was a clock exporting power, holding 35% of the total market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

As pocket watches gained popularity, [[history_of_japanese_watch_industry_development | Japanese companies]] began to make them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. In 1887, only 0.8% of Japanese regularly wore watches; this grew to 4.2% in 1897 and 10% in 1907 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Hat's Rise (Seiko)
The biggest [[history_of_japanese_watch_industry_development | Japanese watchmaker]] was Hattori & Co., founded by Hattori Kintaro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Hattori learned the watch industry from a young age and opened his own shop in 1877 at age 17, repairing and reselling watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. After marrying into a watch trading family, he began selling imported [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss]] and American watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. In 1895, Hattori opened his own factory, Seikosha, initially making wall clocks and high-end grandfather clocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

Initially, [[history_of_japanese_watch_industry_development | Japanese watches]] struggled to compete with [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss]] and American companies due to being less thin, accurate, or reliable, and costing more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Sales volumes were insufficient for [[history_of_japanese_watch_industry_development | Japanese factories]] to achieve economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

#### [[role_of_tariffs_and_trade_policies_in_watch_industry | Tariffs and Import Substitution]]
Western imports had freely entered Japan due to an unequal treaty signed in the mid-1800s with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. However, this treaty lapsed in 1899, and Japan regained sovereignty over its trade relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The [[history_of_japanese_watch_industry_development | Japanese government]] immediately implemented an import substitution policy, raising [[role_of_tariffs_and_trade_policies_in_watch_industry | tariffs]] to protect domestic manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Before 1899, silver and nickel watch imports faced a low 5% [[role_of_tariffs_and_trade_policies_in_watch_industry | tariff]]; after 1899, these rates increased to 25% and then 40% in 1906 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

Protected from Western imports, Hat's watchmaking business flourished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. From 1906 to 1930, his clocks held 48% of the domestic market, and his watches 85% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Government protection and high [[role_of_tariffs_and_trade_policies_in_watch_industry | tariffs]] were significant factors, but not the only ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Hattori's company improved manufacturing by automating a small number of select [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss-inspired]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Out of 25 watch types released between 1895 and 1937, only three sold well: the 1909 Empire pocket watch and two wristwatches, the Laurel and the Seiko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

To gain expertise, Hattori hired engineering labor from Tokyo universities to disassemble and reassemble [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss watches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Crucially, he sourced raw watch parts from [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Switzerland]], which were not subject to [[role_of_tariffs_and_trade_policies_in_watch_industry | tariffs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. From 1915 to 1935, [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Switzerland]] supplied 69% of Japan's watch parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This practice of importing disassembled watch movement sets (known as "shablon") and assembling them within Japan was named after the word "shablon" meaning movement sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Following the introduction of [[role_of_tariffs_and_trade_policies_in_watch_industry | tariffs]] on finished watches in 1900, Japan's imports of watch movements surged from 22,500 in 1895-1899 to 122,000 in 1900 and 250,000 by 1905, far exceeding finished watch imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

The [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss watch industry]] rightly grew concerned that shablon would lead to their long-term downfall by transferring critical watchmaking expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. An example is Rudolph Schmidt, a [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss citizen]] who settled in Yokohama in 1894, initially importing complete watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. After Japan raised [[role_of_tariffs_and_trade_policies_in_watch_industry | tariffs]] in 1908, he began importing shablon into Japan, finishing watches with cases from his family's factory in [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Switzerland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. By 1910, Schmidt shifted the entire process, including case making, to Japan, alarming the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss watch industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. In 1930, Schmidt acquired a workshop that was renamed the Citizen Watch Company, which became the second significant [[history_of_japanese_watch_industry_development | Japanese watchmaker]] after Hattori & Co. (Seiko) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

By 1935, Hattori's watch factory became the single largest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Hattori and Citizen began expanding abroad, advertising their watches as "Japanese made" and highlighting the "extraordinary aptitude" and "exceptional output" of [[history_of_japanese_watch_industry_development | Japanese workers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

#### [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss Response to Competition]]
With watch exports declining in the 1920s, the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss]] reorganized their industry into a cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Part suppliers signed "watchmaking conventions" to only do business with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. A holding company, ASUAG, was established to acquire various movement manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. In 1934, the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss government]] stepped in, controlling all watchmaking activities and monitoring exports of watch parts and machine tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. "Shablon" was made illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This largely achieved its goals, allowing the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss watch industry]] to enjoy high profits and a consistent 50% share of the global watch market for several decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

The 1930s also saw a market transition from pocket watches to wristwatches, which gained new features like self-winding movements, calendars, and waterproof cases, while becoming smaller and more complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

World War II halted watch production for most companies, except the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss]], who remained neutral and gained a leg up in the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. American watch companies struggled post-war against cheap [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss]] imports, leading to a long-term decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Hattori & Co. (Seiko) worked to compete, copying [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss machine tools]], studying their methods, and exploiting cartel loopholes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. By 1966, Hattori produced mechanical watches that performed as well as their [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss]] counterparts, establishing themselves as world leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## The Quartz Revolution

While achieving parity in mechanical watches, Seiko also sought to introduce a new type of watch that would disrupt the mechanical watch world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

The principles behind quartz watches had been known for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. In the 1880s, Pierre Curie discovered that applying pressure or alternating current to a quartz crystal causes it to vibrate consistently at 33,000 times per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. This property could lead to timepieces far more accurate than any mechanical clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. In 1927, a Bell Labs engineer created a room-sized, high-precision quartz clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

By 1960, Bulova, one of the two remaining major American watchmakers, launched the Accutron, the first commercial electronic watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. The Accutron used a 360 Hz tuning fork (not quartz) and was 10 times more accurate than mechanical watches while using fewer discrete parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Its technology was developed by [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss]] scientist Max Hetzel, who turned to the American market after failing to interest anyone in [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Switzerland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Bulova, despite being a first mover, stuck to its tuning fork technology even as quartz emerged as the future, and was eventually acquired by Loews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Nevertheless, the Accutron spurred [[impact_of_technological_advancements_in_watches | technological development]] in electronic watches across the US, Japan, and [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Switzerland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

### Seiko's Quartz Breakthrough
In 1959, Hattori (now Seiko) formed a new team to commercialize quartz timekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. With the [[commercialization_and_global_adoption_of_transistors | commercialization of transistors]], small circuits could power a quartz crystal, measure its oscillations, and translate them into second pulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Their initial goal was a portable quartz chronometer for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, which they successfully delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

After the Olympics, Seiko aimed to miniaturize the technology into a wristwatch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Without access to advanced integrated circuits, they created a hand-soldered hybrid circuit composed of 76 [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | transistors]], 29 condensers, and 84 resistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. Seiko outsourced the production process to American firm Interel, which completed the project and transferred its knowledge to Seiko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Seiko produced most of its [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | transistors]] in-house, but also utilized capacity from Hitachi, NEC, and Toshiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

The Seiko Astron SQ was released on Christmas Day 1969 in Tokyo, costing the equivalent of $31,000 today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. This elegant, limited-edition gold watch, though simple in appearance, "heralded a revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Seiko marketed the Astron with the tagline, "Someday all watches will be made this way," a prediction that proved correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Despite its revolutionary nature, Astron's sales were modest in the first few years; by 1971, Hattori had sold only 3,000 Astron digital watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

### Digital Displays and Market Shift
Around the same time, Hamilton Watch in Pennsylvania developed its own quartz watch, utilizing light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to display time and date without hands or a dial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Hamilton's Pulsar was marketed as a "wrist computer" decades before the Apple Watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Initially released as a luxury P1 version to offset high production costs, it gained significant popularity when James Bond wore a P2 version in the movie *Live and Let Die* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

By the mid-1970s, LED quartz watches became the market standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. In 1974, 650,000 LED watches were sold globally, with analysts predicting a rise to 10 million in a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. LED watches eventually gave way to LCD watches due to better battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

Various integrated circuit firms and traditional watch companies rushed into the digital quartz watch category, seeking a "killer app" for their chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Texas Instruments sold its digital solid-state LED watch for $95-$175 in the same retail outlets as its calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Even Intel briefly ventured into the watch market, acquiring digital watchmaker Microma in 1972 and producing "SmartWatches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. Casio, originally a calculator company, competed with US firm Timex at the low end, offering inexpensive models in drug stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

[[history_of_japanese_watch_industry_development | Japanese watch exports]] to the United States, a critical market for the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss]], exploded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. Export value grew almost tenfold, reaching $26 million in 1975, with watches accounting for nearly 20% of total [[history_of_japanese_watch_industry_development | Japanese exports]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss exports]] stagnated, and their market share plummeted from 83% in the early 1970s to just 20% by 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. By 1985, [[history_of_japanese_watch_industry_development | Japanese watch exports]] to the US totaled $373 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Seiko, Citizen, and Casio effectively pushed the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss]] out of their most valuable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

## Impact and Aftermath
[[history_of_japanese_watch_industry_development | Japanese mechanical watches]] had achieved parity with [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss watches]] before the Astron's arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>, reflecting that export restrictions do not always work as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. However, the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss watch industry]] "fumbled the industry shift" to quartz, despite being aware of the technology and demoing their own prototypes in 1967, two years before the Astron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. The [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss]] took pride in their mechanical heritage, and their sprawling industry structure of many small firms hindered a coordinated shift, as no single company had the resources or expertise to develop quartz technology on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

While mechanical watches require trained artisans and painstaking effort, digital watches made with modern semiconductor production methods offered "titanic scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. Quartz watches ended the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss grip]] on the global watch industry; their market share plummeted from 40% in 1974 to just 10% ten years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. By 1983, over half of [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Switzerland's watchmakers]] had gone bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

Out of necessity, the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss]] also shifted to quartz, and for a brief period, it seemed mechanical watch production techniques might be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. However, the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss mechanical watch industry]] has since made a comeback by recognizing the value of their products beyond accurate timekeeping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Restructuring into the Swatch Group, the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss]] created luxury watch brands and have thrived in this niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

The [[history_of_japanese_watch_industry_development | Japanese watch industry]], conversely, peaked in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. Challenged by industrial competitors in Hong Kong and China, the industry stagnated and relocated manufacturing abroad, struggling to return to its glory years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

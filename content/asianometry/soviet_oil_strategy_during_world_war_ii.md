At the start of the [[soviet_oil_production_in_the_1960s | 1960s]], the Soviet Union was the world's second-largest oil producer, behind only the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, this commanding position was a stark contrast to the state of its oil industry on the eve of World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. The war significantly reshaped Soviet oil policy and investment.

## Pre-War Context

Prior to the war, the Soviet oil industry was stagnant and underfunded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Despite the country's growing energy consumption, which increased over 13% annually throughout the 1920s and 1930s, and the Red Army's increasing need for gasoline (reaching 3 million tons a year by 1940), the Soviets did not prioritize oil for domestic use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. They focused more on hydropower, electrification, and coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This was due to a belief that oil was a finite and expensive resource, leading them to invest heavily in coal liquefaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## German Invasion and Strategic Goals

The Nazi German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941, known as Operation Barbarossa, dramatically altered this outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The German mobile army relied on gasoline for its war machine, but Germany lacked a reliable supply, sourcing most of its oil reserves from Romania, the Soviet Union, and its own coal liquefaction industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Without sufficient fuel, the Luftwaffe (German air force) could not operate at full strategic capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

In 1942, after their attempt to capture Moscow failed, the Germans launched "Case Blue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This plan aimed to capture the oil-rich cities of the Caucasus, including Baku and Grozny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Nazi Germany's leader believed securing these natural resources would resolve their oil shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. However, the Germans faced significant logistical challenges, including how to transport the oil back to Germany and the superior strength of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Ultimately, logistical issues and the onset of winter halted German forces far from their oil field objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. The Luftwaffe was ordered to bomb the fields to disable the Soviet oil industry, but they were too far to cause serious damage to Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Instead, the German leader directed the Sixth Army to seize Stalingrad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

## Soviet Response: Evacuation and the "Second Baku"

Anticipating the German advance on Baku, the Red Army rapidly evacuated personnel and machinery from the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. Drilling equipment, pipelines, and even entire refineries were disassembled and moved to the Volga-Ural area, which became known as the "Second Baku" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. This evacuation devastated oil production in the Caucasus, which dropped over 50% in a single year to levels not seen since the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Azerbaijani historians note that production rates in the Caucasus did not return to 1941 levels until after the Soviet Union dissolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

Simultaneously, the Soviets scrambled to increase oil production in the Volga-Ural oil fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. A major challenge was the high sulfur content of the crude oils from these fields, which Soviet oilmen struggled to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. They often resorted to mixing oils from Baku and Volga-Ural to make them more usable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. The Americans aided these efforts by disassembling and sending six refineries to the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

Joseph Stalin personally emphasized the critical importance of oil, calling petroleum "the soul of military equipment" and hailing oilmen as "Warriors at the oil front" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Despite these efforts, the Soviets lacked the necessary time and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, and oil production in the Volga-Urals never ramped up enough during the war to fully replace the production lost at Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

## Post-War Implications

World War II profoundly taught the Soviets the importance of oil and petroleum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. After the war, they sought to control as much of it as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This strategic goal was reflected in their occupation of territories, including Romania and temporary control of Austria's oil industry, on which the Soviet Union relied for imported oil until the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. To revitalize production, the Red Army confiscated oil technologies, often originally sourced from the West, and transported them back to the Soviet Union as war booty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

This wartime experience laid the groundwork for significant [[postwar_soviet_union_oil_industry_developments | postwar Soviet Union oil industry developments]]. Throughout the 1950s, the Soviets heavily invested in developing the oil fields of the Volga-Ural Basin, shifting priority away from Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. By the end of the 1950s, fields like Romashkino, spanning 4,200 square kilometers (six times the size of Singapore), produced more oil than all other regions combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The Volga-Ural Basin remains a significant oil production area today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. This expansion allowed the [[soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union as an energy superpower]] to leverage its oil and gas exports for economic gain and political influence, a strategy with long-term implications for the [[economic_impact_of_oil_production_on_the_Soviet_economy | Soviet economy in the 1960s]] and its international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

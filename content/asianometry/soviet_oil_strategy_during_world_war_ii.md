On the eve of World War II, the [[Soviet Union]]'s oil industry was stagnant and underfunded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Despite oil becoming a profitable export, the Soviets historically did not prioritize its domestic use, focusing instead on hydropower, electrification, and coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. They believed oil was a finite resource, too expensive and rare to compete with alternatives like coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, and even invested in [[coal liquefaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

## German Invasion and Oil Objectives

The Nazi German invasion in June 1941, known as [[Operation Barbarossa]], highlighted the critical importance of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The German mobile army needed gasoline for its war machine, including aircraft, cars, trucks, and trains, but lacked a reliable supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Most of Germany's 56 million barrels of oil reserves before the operation came from Romania, the [[Soviet Union]], and their own [[coal liquefaction]] industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Without sufficient fuel, the [[Luftwaffe]] could not operate to its full strategic capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

In 1942, after their attempt to capture Moscow was thwarted, the Germans devised "Case Blue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This plan sought to capture the oil-rich cities of the Caucasus, including [[Baku]] and Grozny, believing these natural resources would alleviate their oil hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. However, logistical issues and the winter halted German forces far short of these oil fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. The [[Luftwaffe]] was ordered to bomb the fields to disable the Soviet oil industry, but they were too far away to seriously damage [[Baku]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Ultimately, the German leader fatefully directed the Sixth Army to invade and seize [[Stalingrad]] instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## Soviet Response: Evacuation and the "Second Baku"

Expecting the Germans to arrive at [[Baku]] at any moment, the [[Red Army]] began evacuating personnel and machinery out of the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Drilling equipment, unattached pipelines, and even entire refineries were disassembled and brought to the [[Volga-Ural]] area, which became known as the "Second [[Baku]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. This evacuation devastated oil production in the Caucasus, with numbers dropping to levels not seen since the 1920s, a 50% decline in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Azerbaijani historians note that oil production rates in the region did not return to 1941 levels until after the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union linked to oil and gas industry challenges | Soviet Union dissolved]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

The Soviets scrambled to ramp up oil production in the [[Volga-Ural]] oil fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. A key challenge was the particularly high sulfur content of the crude oils from this region, which Soviet oilmen struggled with, often resorting to mixing them with [[Baku]] oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. The Americans aided this effort by disassembling and sending six of their own refineries to the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. [[Stalin]] threw everything he could into production, calling petroleum "the soul of military equipment" and hailing oilmen as "Warriors at the oil front" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. However, oil production in the [[Volga-Ural]] never ramped up enough during the war to fully replace the production lost at [[Baku]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

## Post-War Shift

The war taught the Soviets the critical importance of oil and petroleum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. After the war, they sought to control as much of it as possible, occupying Romania and temporarily taking control of Austria's oil industry to support their needs until the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. To revitalize production, the [[Red Army]] confiscated oil technologies, much of it originally sourced from the West, and sent it back home as war booty, particularly seeking pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Throughout the 1950s, the Soviets significantly invested in developing the oil fields of the [[Volga-Ural]] Basin, making it the new priority over [[Baku]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. By the end of the 1950s, fields like Romashkino were producing more oil than the rest of the country's regions combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The [[Volga-Ural]] Basin remains a significant oil production area to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

The [[Rise of the Soviet Union as an energy superpower | Soviet Union]] tapped its vast natural resources to survive and grow from its early days, with oil and gas helping [[Lenin]] industrialize the country and fueling the [[Red Army]]'s victory over Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. As production expanded, the Soviets began exporting energy to earn foreign currency and later to use it as political leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

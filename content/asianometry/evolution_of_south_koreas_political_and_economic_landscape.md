From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

South Korea's economic landscape is characterized by its reliance on massive business groups, commonly known as [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]], such as Samsung, Hyundai, and LG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While these groups are a significant economic strength, powering the export economy and dominating daily life, they also contribute to economic weaknesses by manipulating the economy to their advantage and maintaining [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | corrupt]] ties with high levels of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Historical Roots of [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | Corruption]] and Economic Structure

[[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | Corruption]] in Korea predates the modern state, with the Japanese colonial agricultural economy being quite [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | corrupt]] and unequal, where large landlords exploited farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Many of these legacies transferred to the new South Korean government after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Syngman Rhee Administration (Post-WWII to 1961)

South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee, was a staunch anti-communist who committed massacres against suspected communists, leading to approximately 100,000 deaths, including the Bodo League massacre in 1950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He also initiated the creation of the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. To raise funds for the Korean War, his government, starting in 1946 and peaking in the 1950s, sold off assets seized from the Japanese state and other state-owned entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The prices for these privatizations were determined by private negotiation rather than public auction, enabling "a steal by any value investing metric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Purchasers of these assets, similar to Japan's zaibatsu, eventually formed the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Park Chung-hee Era and [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | Crony Capitalism]] (1961-1979)

In 1961, Park Chung-hee led a military coup, ending the Second Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Initially, Park arrested [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] heads for corrupt wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. However, his government quickly negotiated a [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | crony capitalism]] deal with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Park sought to emulate Japan's industrialization and needed the companies' assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Under this arrangement:
*   The [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] supported Park's policies for import substitution and later exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   The government provided [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] with foreign currency loans at below-market interest rates to acquire foreign technologies and build capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | Chaebol]] contributed funds for Park's presidential campaigns (10-15% loan commissions or kickbacks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   Companies found that close ties with the president, such as Park Chung-hee's relationship with Chung Ju-yung of Hyundai and Kim Woo-jong of [[rise_and_fall_of_daewoo_group | Daewoo]], were the best way to acquire cheap capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   Kickbacks grew over time; the top five [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] contributed over 800 million won annually before 1972, increasing to 1.5 billion won after 1972 (adjusted to 1990 prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

For 20 years, the government and [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] ran Korean society as dominant actors, with companies funding campaigns and satisfying the social compact of economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The government granted privileges to the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] and imposed the costs of their excesses onto society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. For example, in 1971, when the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] were over-leveraged, the government converted their private market loans to five-year public ones and froze private interest rates, harming small lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

This [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]]-centric strategy suffocated South Korea's small and medium-sized business sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. From 1966 to 1976, manufacturing firms grew by only 10%, but their size exploded by 176% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. In contrast, Taiwan, which pursued a less cozy state-business relationship, saw its manufacturing firms grow by 150% with only a 29% increase in firm size during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Democratization and Shifting Power Dynamics (1980s-1990s)

As South Korea entered the 1980s, the military dictatorship gradually lost its monopoly on power, and the partnership between the government and [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] became shakier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. By the mid-1980s, the balance of power decisively shifted in the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]]'s favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The top five [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] accounted for nearly 20% of the country's GDP and 45% of its mining/manufacturing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The vast imbalance between the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] and the rest of the country became a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

As people became richer, they desired more than just higher wages; they sought better environmental regulations, working conditions, and a better life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The government, increasingly democratic, had to respond, shifting from support to regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Despite this, leaders still needed [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] financial contributions to stay in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

Under Chun Doo-hwan, [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] contributed 15 to 22 billion won to high-level political campaigns, and 21 to 25 billion won during Roh Tae-woo's administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The weakness of South Korea's political parties contributed to this [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | corrupt]] deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. When the country democratized in 1987, holding free elections, there were no suitable political campaigning norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Without above-board financing, parties and candidates were vulnerable to [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | corruption]], allowing the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] to continue receiving government aid, plentiful capital, favorable regulations, and protection from competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## [[impact_of_financial_crises_on_south_korean_business_practices | Asian Financial Crisis]] and Subsequent Reforms (1997 Onwards)

In the 10 years after democratization in 1987, the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] gained substantial political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. For example, in 1988, [[rise_and_fall_of_daewoo_group | Daewoo Group]] successfully lobbied the National Assembly to amend the law to allow a government bailout of its ailing shipbuilding corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. They also used their influence to push for rapid liberalization reforms that aided their growth and expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

Key reforms prior to the crisis:
*   **Easier access to foreign capital:** Allowing [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] to take out cheap loans denominated in foreign currencies, which kicked off a massive debt boom culminating in the [[impact_of_financial_crises_on_south_korean_business_practices | Asian Financial Crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Limited ownership in non-bank financial companies:** This encouraged super-complicated cross-ownership structures that obscured the true size and financial health of [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. For instance, the Lee family, controlling Samsung Group, could exercise operational control over almost all affiliated companies with only a minority share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This complexity meant profitable companies propped up weak ones, leading to market inefficiencies and oversupply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The [[impact_of_financial_crises_on_south_korean_business_practices | Asian Financial Crisis]] in 1997 vastly curtailed the power of the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]], creating an opportunity for reforms aimed at "common prosperity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun administrations imposed various reforms on the ailing [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The goals were to prevent future financial crises by limiting debt capacity and cross-shareholder structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

Consequences of these reforms included:
*   Hanjin Shipping had to reduce its debt-to-equity loads below 200%, forcing it to sell ships and lease others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   The Korean car industry consolidated from five independent companies in 1997 to just one, Hyundai, soon after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | Chaebol]] reduced and further separated their affiliates; a sample showed 819 affiliates in 1997 dropping to 544 three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   Dividends to minority shareholders, often stiffed by cross-holdings, significantly increased from 2.2 trillion won in 2001 to 10.8 trillion by 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

The crisis also helped create the Korean export juggernaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Recognizing an unfriendly domestic environment, the biggest [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] capitalized on free trade agreements in the 2000s and turned outwards, becoming wildly successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. By 2013, 86% of Samsung's revenue came from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This success drove South Korea's economic recovery, with an average growth rate of 5% from 1998 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## [[social_inequality_and_economic_reforms_in_south_korea | Social Inequality]] and Political Responses

Despite robust GDP growth, the benefits of this growth were concentrated among a small group, leading to a significant gap between the "haves" and "have-nots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. In 2013, [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] generated over 50% of revenue and value-add in manufacturing but employed less than 20% of the sector's employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

During the reform era after 1997, the government agreed to make it easier for [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] to lay off people in exchange for increased profitability to service debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Hundreds of thousands lost jobs, with many unable to find regular salaried work since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Elder poverty in South Korea reached four times the OECD average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The income share for the top 1% of Korean society rose from 7% before 1997 to 12% in the mid-2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The Korean people recognized this [[social_inequality_and_economic_reforms_in_south_korea | inequality]] and felt they had not shared in the success of the country's "national champions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

### Lee Myung-bak Administration (2007-2012)

In 2007, the Korean people voted for a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. President Lee Myung-bak, a conservative and former CEO of Hyundai Construction, emphasized economic recovery after what he called a "lost decade" of liberal rule, despite the 5% average annual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. His "747 promise" aimed for 7% GDP growth, $40,000 per capita income, and making Korea the seventh-largest economy through "CEO style management" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Lee won with the highest margin in years, but low voter participation indicated a loss of faith in the government's ability to curb [[social_inequality_and_economic_reforms_in_south_korea | social inequalities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

Lee's business policies aimed to enhance the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]]'s global competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. He lowered the corporate tax rate from 25% to 20%, raised the ceiling on non-bank financial investment, and amnestied executives convicted after the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. He continued market-oriented reforms, granting more decision-making power to industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. While aiming to bring back Park Chung-hee era rapid growth, Lee did not force [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] to funnel profits into new, risky industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Instead, money was funneled to "rust-belt industries" like construction and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. Ultimately, his administration did not deliver the promised growth, with GDP growth continuing to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Lee was later arrested in 2018 on charges of bribery, embezzlement, and tax fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### Continued [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | Corruption]] and Public Safety

In the 2012 presidential election, Park Geun-hye, a conservative, shifted leftward in her messaging, combining nostalgia for "glory years" with an emphasis on welfare, though she did not advocate for a higher capital gains tax, which is key to the accelerating Korean wealth gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

Modern [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | corruption]] by [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] aims to maximize wealth and market power through tax manipulations and regulatory capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. The consequences of these actions were tragically highlighted by the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking, which claimed 304 lives, mostly high school students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. While the ferry was old and overloaded, the most proximate cause of the high death rate was that safety and rescue regulations were ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. The regulatory agency and the ferry company had a close relationship, ignoring violations to maintain the profitable status quo, including the rotation of government employees into the industry and the company's monopoly privilege on the lucrative Incheon-Jeju ferry route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

President Park Geun-hye's administration ended in corruption scandals and impeachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Her successor, Moon Jae-in, responded with business reforms and higher tax rates, leading to some improvement in public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

## Current Challenges

South Korea's economy, like Taiwan's, is now heavily dependent on a handful of powerful global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Substantial reform risks weakening their global competitive position against companies in the United States, Europe, and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. South Korean democratic society is increasingly polarized, and [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] reform remains a furiously debated issue in presidential politics, alongside North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

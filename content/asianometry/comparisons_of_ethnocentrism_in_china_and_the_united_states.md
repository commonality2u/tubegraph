Concerns about Han ethnic supremacy are growing on China's internet and in cultural discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While easy to dismiss, these expressions are real views from real people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This phenomenon has parallels with ethnocentric trends observed in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## Han Ethnocentrism in China

### Defining "Han"
The definition of "Han" is complex and dynamic, similar to how the definition of "white" has evolved in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. It is not merely a distinct nationality, ethnicity, or race, but rather a "constructed bundle" of items grouped together, such as adherence to Confucian values or certain rites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The existence of diverse ethnic groups like the Hakka and Cantonese within the broader Han identity serves as proof of this fluid definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Han supremacists, however, disregard this nuance, viewing "Han-ness" as a single, mono-race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. They assert that the Han people are the "core race in China," with their interests being "one in one with those of China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This includes the belief that Han people have "five thousand years of direct racial inheritance" and "the purest" blood in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

In reality, Han people are genetically a "deeply intermixed breed," having migrated and mixed for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Historical Context and Government Policies
Han nationalism played a significant role in the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, leading to the establishment of both the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Centuries of rule by the Manchu people grated against the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

However, leaders like Sun Yat-sen of the ROC recognized that continued Han supremacy could divide the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. He and other founders promoted racial harmony, exemplified by the five-colored flag and the principle of "five races under one union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Despite this, [[historical_revisionism_and_ethnocentrism|Han ethnocentrism]] and the suppression of ethnic minorities remained persistent issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) gained support from ethnic minorities who felt disillusioned with the ROC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Mao Zedong himself held strong views on the value of China's ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. He stated in an April 1956 speech:
> "All through the ages the reactionary rulers chiefly from the Han nationality sowed feelings of estrangement among our various nationalities and bullied the minority peoples. Even among the working people it is not easy to eliminate the resultant influences in a short time. So we have to make extensive and sustained efforts to educate both the cadres and the masses in our proletarian nationality policy and make a point of frequently reviewing the relationship between that Han nationality and the minority nationalities. If the relationship is found to be abnormal then we must deal with it in earnest and not just in words." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>

The PRC pays significant attention to [[ethnic_minority_policies_in_china|ethnic minority and racial harmony issues]] for both ideological and practical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. In the 1950s, the CCP helped codify and classify China's ethnic minorities, resulting in 56 recognized nationalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The People's Congress then crafted affirmative action policies and preferential treatment to help minorities achieve an even level with the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

These benefits include:
*   Regional ethnic autonomous states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>
*   Dedicated cultural institutions (museums, parks, schools) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
*   Preferential treatment in the *gaokao* (national testing exam), where minorities in western China might need 200 points compared to 500 for Han people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>
*   An exemption to the One-Child Policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>

### Han Resentment and Cultural Movements
While these policies were introduced to address existing gaps in income, wealth, and employment between ethnic minorities and the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, they have largely failed to close these gaps and have instead cultivated resentment from the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Han nationalists view themselves as the "crucial driver of the Chinese nation and its glorious history," yet feel unfairly treated compared to ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This has led to the emergence of dozens of Han culture forums and websites in China, Taiwan, and the overseas Chinese diaspora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

One example is the Hanfu movement, which advocates for the revitalization of Han Chinese clothing worn before the Manchu conquest of the Ming Dynasty, rejecting Qing-era attire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. While the movement went mainstream due to the aesthetic appeal of the clothes, it also served as a "gateway drug" for harder versions of Han supremacism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

[[historical_revisionism_and_ethnocentrism|Han ethnocentrists]] harbor a particular dislike for the Manchu people, vigorously fighting to revise views of the Qing dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. They portray the Qing dynasty and its Manchu leaders as bloodthirsty, arguing they rolled back Ming advancements, stole Han wealth, and made China a "backwards country" that allowed Western invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This is a simplification of a complex history, used to "hijack history" for their own purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. The goal of such [[historical_revisionism_and_ethnocentrism|historical revisionism]] is to reject centuries of China's history and blame its decline on a "foreign face," absolving the Han of any responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

The most common complaints against [[ethnic_minority_policies_in_china|CCP affirmative action policies]] relate to the easier thresholds for ethnic minorities in national examinations and the exemption from the One-Child Policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This exemption has led to an increase in the proportion of ethnic minorities in China from 3% in 1949 to 8% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. To Han supremacists, this constitutes the Han people "conducting their own self-destruction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Incidents of ethnic violence also fuel anti-minority sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## Ethnocentrism in the United States

The United States also grapples with issues of ethnocentrism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. The nation was founded with ideals binding together peoples of different races and creeds under concepts of freedom and the pursuit of happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. However, the reality has often fallen short of these values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Over decades, Americans have attempted to become more inclusive and expand the definition of "American" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

Despite these efforts, there is a "darker school of thought" that believes America's success is built exclusively on Christianity and Christian values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. An even further extreme argues for American white ethnocentrism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## Comparisons and Challenges

Both China and the United States face similar challenges with ethnocentric ideologies:
*   **Inclusivity vs. Exclusion**: One school of thought advocates for inclusiveness, believing people can be accepted into Chinese society or even the Han race by practicing Confucian values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Similarly, the US has tried to expand its definition of "American" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Hierarchical Views**: A "darker school of thought" in China advocates for an inherent gap between the Han people and "barbarians," a historically significant label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This mirrors American white ethnocentrism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Persistence of Gaps**: In both countries, income, wealth, and employment gaps persist between majority and minority populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

The Chinese government attempts to foster cross-ethnic unity and dodge these concerns by creating an "us versus them" dynamic against "the West," promoting an "acceptable level of anti-foreign" sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. While this might suppress Han supremacism in the short term, its long-term health as a tactic is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

Han supremacism is considered a serious and widespread problem, not just a niche group or internet phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. It is a problem that can easily seduce those in power, particularly if they are part of the majority group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

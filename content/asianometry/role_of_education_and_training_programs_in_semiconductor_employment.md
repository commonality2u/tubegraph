The semiconductor industry relies heavily on specialized education and training programs to cultivate its workforce, though attracting and retaining talent presents significant challenges, particularly in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

## Perceived Challenges in Semiconductor Careers

Discussions about [[career_prospects_in_the_semiconductor_industry_versus_software_development | semiconductor degree programs]] in the United States often highlight negative perceptions of the career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Comments on platforms like Hacker News suggest that manufacturing roles, particularly for "fab people," involve long hours, frequent on-call duties, and sometimes abusive work environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

For engineers at companies like TSMC, the long-term career prospects are described as poor, often requiring a PhD and post-doctorate experience, alongside over 10 years in a "sweatshop" R&D environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Overall, the perception is that semiconductor careers are "problematic" with long hours, subpar labor practices, and low pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Types of Roles and Educational Requirements

The semiconductor industry broadly consists of manufacturing and design jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   **Design Jobs** involve creating chip designs and often resemble software engineering, offering comfortable office environments and higher pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. TSMC, for example, hires many IC design engineers to work with customers and also employs software developers, including AI engineers, to develop algorithms for machine performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Jobs** require hands-on work in fabs, often involving clean suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. These roles include:
    *   **Line Technicians and Operators:** These positions typically require only a high school or vocational school degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Their internal job progression is limited, often only ascending to foreman status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
    *   **Engineers:**
        *   **Process Engineers:** Inspect and analyze manufacturing processes, needing to optimize variables and test for yield rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
        *   **Equipment Engineers:** Monitor and inspect equipment, requiring a technical degree, though not always in electrical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
        *   **R&D Engineers:** Work on new product development under high pressure, regularly requiring PhDs and long hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
        *   **Production Management Engineers:** Handle forecasting and logistics, often requiring stronger English skills due to interaction with Western customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
        *   **Smart Manufacturing and AI Engineers:** Use big data and AI to improve production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

## [[industry_strategies_for_attracting_talent_to_semiconductor_manufacturing | Industry Strategies for Attracting Talent]]

Semiconductor foundries face difficulties in filling positions, particularly in the U.S., where the lucrative software development industry offers more attractive [[career_prospects_in_the_semiconductor_industry_versus_software_development | career prospects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. Software development is perceived as easier to enter, with numerous companies, legendary perks, and obscenely high salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. This trend is evident in the fact that 9 out of 10 Berkeley EECS (Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences) majors in 2018 pursued software engineering careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

Even in Taiwan, where electrical engineering is highly emphasized and TSMC is a dream employer, the company experiences significant turnover among technicians and engineers due to demanding [[impact_of_work_culture_on_semiconductor_industry_turnover | work culture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.

To address these challenges, companies like Intel have developed their own talent pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>:
*   **Community College Partnerships:** Intel has a long-standing partnership with Arizona community colleges, enrolling prospective technicians in two-year technical education degree programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.
*   **Research Grants and Training:** In Malaysia, Intel offered research grants for students to learn semiconductor engineering, particularly in packaging, and senior engineers contributed time to train these individuals in industry practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

While these programs create a trained, affordable workforce tailored to specific company needs, they can also lead to highly specialized skills that make it difficult for workers to leave the field, potentially resulting in underpayment or poor treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. This issue is compounded by the limited number of companies involved in advanced semiconductor manufacturing, contrasting with the broader employer pool for software engineers and IC chip designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

## Fostering Early Interest in Hardware

A significant factor contributing to the lack of interest in semiconductor careers among young Americans is the limited access to hardware, compared to the easy access to software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. While open-source software allows young people to easily explore and develop an interest that leads to careers, modern hardware is far more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.

In the 1960s, an average person could repair a transistor radio, and personal computers still allowed direct interaction with hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. Today, devices like cell phones are too complex for casual tinkering; users primarily interact with software and user interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. This lack of hands-on interaction means young people grow up without considering the intricate integrated chips, thus deterring them from pursuing careers in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.

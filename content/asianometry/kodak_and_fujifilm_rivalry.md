For a significant period, two companies, Eastman Kodak and Fujifilm, dominated the silver-based photographic film industry, clashing for dominance in their respective and global markets for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Dawn of Digital Disruption

Very suddenly, the market for silver-based film began to collapse due to [[digital_photography_disruption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Although [[digital_photography_disruption | digital photography]] was long considered 30 years away, it arrived abruptly, annihilating the traditional film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Fujifilm anticipated this shift, yet it still impacted them severely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Amazingly, they emerged from the digital transition as a larger, transformed company, while Kodak did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Fujifilm's Founding and Early Strategy

Fujifilm was established in 1934 as a subsidiary of Dai Nippon Celluloid Company, Japan's inaugural cinematic film manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Dai Nippon had previously sought assistance from Kodak's founder, George Eastman, to construct a photographic film factory in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. However, Kodak's engineers deemed Japan's climate too humid for high-quality film production, leading Eastman to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. In response, Dai Nippon, backed by the Japanese government, founded Fuji Photo Film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The company's first factory was strategically located at the foot of Mount Fuji in Minami Ashigara City, Kanagawa, for its access to high-quality water and air, which likely explains its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Unlike its competitors, Fujifilm chose to produce its photographic film internally rather than importing it, even hiring a German emulsion specialist for technical expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This dedication to developing their own technology, despite the initial difficulties and years required to produce their first product, became a cornerstone of their culture and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Fujifilm became known for outspending its peers on research and development (R&D) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

Before World War II, Fujifilm invested in color photography film research, a complex process requiring precise mixing of cyan, magenta, and yellow to avoid color imbalances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Color photographic film consists of approximately 20 overlapping, evenly coated layers of functional particles, about 20 micrometers thick, demanding "near semiconductor quality control" for production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The war temporarily halted their work as the Japanese military government commandeered their facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Fujifilm finally completed their color film product in 1948, followed by popular products like amateur roll film in 1952 and black and white roll film in 1958, distinguishing them from nearly 30 domestic competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Global Market Competition

Around the time Japan reopened its markets to foreign competitors, including Kodak, the rivalry between the two intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Initially, the disparity was vast: in 1963, Fujifilm generated $75 million in revenue, while Kodak boasted $1.1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Kodak had a globally recognized brand, seemingly unlimited resources, and even owned its own silver mine and cattle ranch for film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Though war interrupted Kodak's imports to Japan, they resumed in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Fujifilm benefited from preferential treatment in its domestic market, including an import quota until 1968 and a tariff thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Despite this, Japanese consumers initially perceived Kodak as a superior brand and Fujifilm's products as lower quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

Over time, Fujifilm closed the technical proficiency gap, with their films outperforming Kodak's in certain areas by 1970, such as requiring less light for color pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Fujifilm leveraged this technical edge to maintain its niche in the Japanese high-end prosumer and professional photography market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. A key part of their strategy was the "mini lab" retail push, allowing third parties to offer speedy one-hour development, creating a powerful network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. By 1994, Japan had 13,400 mini labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Kodak's Japanese market entry strategy was hindered by outsourcing marketing to a third-party distributor that primarily cut prices, relegating Kodak to the low-end segment in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

In 1972, Fujifilm began selling directly into the United States market under its own brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. While unable to penetrate the drugstore market loyal to Kodak, Fujifilm found success in American supermarkets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. They then broke into the niche movie and professional photographer spaces by emphasizing technical quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Fujifilm sponsored major sporting leagues like the NBA and the Olympics, becoming the official sponsor of the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. In 1982, they received an Academy Award for Technical Merit for their A250 Motion Picture film, the world's fastest color motion picture negative film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. These achievements solidified Fujifilm's reputation as a "superior quality" film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

Fujifilm's rising success, reaching 13% market share in the U.S. by 1995, led to political problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. In 1993, Kodak filed a lawsuit against Fujifilm for dumping, which Kodak lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Fujifilm responded by establishing a color film paper lab in South Carolina to ease concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. In July 1995, Kodak petitioned, alleging Fujifilm colluded with the Japanese government to exclude Kodak products from the Japanese market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Fujifilm held 70% market share in Japan, while Kodak had less than 10%, atypical for a company accustomed to 40%+ share in developed markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Fujifilm vigorously defended itself, leading to the World Trade Organization (WTO) rejecting the lawsuit in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The intense competition between Kodak and Fujifilm, spanning price, sponsorships, and legal battles, was legendary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## The Digital Photography Disruption and Corporate Response

By the time the WTO decision was announced in 1998, both companies were less focused on their rivalry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Both Kodak and Fujifilm had long acknowledged [[digital_photography_disruption | digital imaging]] as the future, developing many related technologies themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Kodak's Missed Opportunities

In 1975, Kodak employee Steve Sasson created the first digital camera, weighing 8 pounds and the size of a toaster, though it produced poor imagery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Kodak employees recognized its potential, predicting silver-based imaging would cease to exist by the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Kodak scientists developed high-quality image sensors, including a 1.4 million-pixel CCD sensor in 1986, but it failed commercially due to high price and lack of peripherals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Kodak's digital explorations often only resulted in patents, not new successful businesses, as traditional film was considered "one of the greatest business models ever discovered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. They struggled to settle on a plan for the digital era and hesitated to pursue ventures that didn't fit their existing model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. For instance, in 1976, Kodak had the Ektaprint, a simpler, more reliable printer with a microprocessor than Xerox's rival, but failed to aggressively pursue the market due to unfamiliarity with the heavy equipment rental business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Fujifilm's Foresight and Diversification

[[Fujifilms diversification strategy | Fujifilm's diversified business]] provided early warnings of impending changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. In 1981, they released a product for diagnostic X-ray imaging, replacing X-ray film with a photosensitive plate, leading to Fuji Computed Radiography in 1983, still in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:09:06]</a>. The digitization of plate making for publications like magazines, enabling computer-generated output on a single film, worried sales manager Shigataka Komori about a future without film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Fujifilm was accustomed to fierce competition and believed a great product at a decent price guaranteed business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. However, with image digitization, the hard work and specialized technologies developed for photography would become irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Recognizing this, in 1980, Fujifilm appointed Minoru Onishi as president, who introduced a three-pronged strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>:
1.  **Pioneer Digital Imaging Technologies**: Similar to Kodak, Fujifilm sought to produce original digital imaging technologies, developing their own sensors and releasing the Fujifilm DS-1P, their first digital camera, in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
2.  **Milk the Analog Cash Cow**: They aimed to prolong the life of the analog business by widening the quality gap with digital through improved film image quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
3.  **Build New Business Lines**: The company needed to establish new businesses outside of [[digital_photography_disruption | digital photography]] and analog photographic film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

In the mid-1980s, Fujifilm invested in various [[Fujifilms diversification strategy | diversifications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Some were peripheral to their core photography and imaging, like inkjet and optical disks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Others leveraged core photographic film manufacturing technologies, such as cancer pharmaceuticals, developed with a Nobel prize-winning scientist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

The challenge for Fujifilm was that its core business was still thriving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. By the 1980s, they had surpassed Kodak technologically, releasing popular products like the 1986 Fujifilm QuickSnap, one of the first modern disposable cameras, which was highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. With the Japanese economy booming, film sales were sky-high, generating over $600 million USD in operating profits in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This success ironically hindered diversification efforts, leading to rationalizations that digital would never be as good as analog or that the transition was 30 years away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

## The Digital Tipping Point

In 1995, Casio released the QV-10, the first commercially successful consumer digital camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Costing $833, its image quality was still inferior to film, and battery life was poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. However, it featured a 1.8-inch color LCD screen, allowing users to view photos instantly without developing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Other electronics companies like Sony followed, but early CCD-based digital cameras struggled with subpar image quality, slow shutter speeds, poor battery life, and high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

[[Traditional vs digital cameras | Photographic film]] and camera sales resisted these early digital models, peaking in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. But a year later, global color film demand plummeted by 20-30% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This rapid decline was triggered by the widespread adoption of the CMOS image sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. While CCDs were specialty chips requiring expensive, power-hungry peripherals, CMOS image sensors, being silicon semiconductors, could be mass-produced cheaply by existing fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. By the mid-1990s, process nodes were sophisticated enough for high-quality active pixel CMOS image sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. The final piece was their inclusion in mobile phones in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. CMOS image sensors became the fastest-ramping semiconductor product in history, marking the beginning of the end for silver-based film cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

## Fujifilm's "Vision 75" and Radical Transformation

In 2004, with its core business collapsing, Fujifilm's CEO Shigataka Komori announced "Vision 75," a medium-term plan named for the company's upcoming 75th anniversary in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This plan aimed to guide the company beyond its roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

Vision 75 comprised three steps:
1.  **Implement Strategic Reforms**: Fujifilm employed 15,000 people in large photography film factories across Europe, Japan, and the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This expensive infrastructure was unsustainable for a shrinking business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. From 2006, Fujifilm spent $1.8 billion cutting jobs, closing factories, and canceling distributor partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. While competitor Konica exited photography entirely, Komori remained committed to preserving the "culture of Photography," and Fujifilm still produces film today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
2.  **Find New Profitable Growth Businesses**: Fujifilm, like Kodak, had a position in [[Traditional vs digital cameras | digital cameras]], but selling cameras was and remains a difficult business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. The profit was in film, not the camera itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Photographic film once accounted for 60% of Fuji's sales and two-thirds of its profits; digital cameras couldn't replace this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. This led Fujifilm to [[Fujifilms transition to new markets | transition to entirely new markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

    Many new markets emerged from their film technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. For example, Fujitec, a transparent celluloid produced in the 1950s for film bases, found new applications in diverse industries from electrical insulation to anime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. By the 1980s, LCD makers used Fujitec as a protective covering for polarizing layers, becoming a billion-dollar business by the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
    Inspired by Fujitec, Fujifilm reviewed all its laboratory technologies, identifying six priority businesses after a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>:
    *   **Digital Imaging**: Producing high-end digital cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
    *   **Optical Devices**: Known as Fujinon, producing lenses for broadcast television and security cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
    *   **Specialty Chemicals/Materials**: Serving industries like solar panels, touch panels, and semiconductors, including photoresists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
    *   **Graphics**: Items for digital printing and in-house inkjet technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
    *   **Documents/Printers/Office Copier Solutions**: Primarily through its Fuji Xerox joint venture, this division (now Fujifilm Business Innovation) became the company's largest business line in 2021, accounting for 30% of total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
    *   **Healthcare**: Fujifilm's diversification into healthcare represents its ultimate commitment to survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Leveraging expertise from X-ray film, they sold endoscopes, ultrasonic devices, and healthcare imaging systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. From 1996, Fujifilm significantly increased patent applications for pharmaceutical products and medical care equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. They began producing skincare cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements, finding crossovers with film production expertise in emulsions, oxidation, and collagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. This R&D surge was augmented by strategic acquisitions, including several medical imaging companies in 2006 and Toyama Chemical in 2008 for nearly $1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

## Divergent Outcomes

For its 2008 fiscal year, Fujifilm reported its highest sales ever: 2.8 trillion yen (approximately $27 billion USD), a 100% increase from 1.4 trillion yen in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. Operating profit also rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. By 2008, Fujifilm was a far more [[Fujifilms diversification strategy | diversified company]]; imaging products like [[Traditional vs digital cameras | digital cameras]] fell from 54% to just 19% of company revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Though hit by the global financial crisis and the strengthening Japanese Yen, Fujifilm has largely maintained annual revenues around $20 billion since 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. This is a much better outcome than what befell Kodak, whose sales declined from $11 billion to $5.9 billion between 2005 and 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>, while Fujifilm's sales grew nearly 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

### [[Kodaks failure to adapt | Kodak's Failure to Adapt]]

Business schools have extensively studied [[Kodaks failure to adapt | Kodak's situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. Kodak initially adopted a similar path to Fujifilm, such as shrinking its film manufacturing business in 1999, cutting $1.2 billion in costs and 20,000 jobs (20% of payroll) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. However, they could not move beyond the idea of selling film and providing photography services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Former CEO Colby Chandler attempted diversification into floppy disks, batteries, artificial snow, and pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>, but his successors, Kay Whitmore and George Fisher, reversed this, doubling down on imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

Notably, in 1993, Kodak spun off its specialty chemical business (formed in 1920), which generated only 8% of its sales from Kodak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. Today, Eastman Chemical is a $10 billion Fortune 500 company, representing a missed diversification opportunity for Kodak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. Kodak also sold its Sterling Winthrop drug unit, whose over-the-counter consumer drugs business, including Bayer Aspirin, generated over $1 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. Though Kodak had also researched and filed pharmaceutical and medical equipment patents around the same time as Fujifilm, they withdrew from these in 1996, recommitting to photography and branding themselves an "Imaging company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

Kodak's final strategy was to develop or promote new digital technologies to fulfill their customers' imaging needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. In 2001, they released the EasyShare digital camera, which sold well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. Kodak produced well-reviewed digital cameras and even held a leading market share in the U.S. digital camera space between 2004-2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. However, like Fujifilm, they quickly learned that [[Traditional vs digital cameras | digital cameras]] were a poor business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. Market share shriveled to 7% by 2010, and the company earned more from licensing its digital technology patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

In 2005, Kodak entered the inkjet printer business, competing with giants like Hewlett-Packard, likely at the behest of new CEO Antonio Perez, who came from HP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. This foray resulted in net losses of $1.2 billion in 2005 and $691 million in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. In 2007, Kodak sold its last valuable asset, its Healthcare division, which included radiology and medical printing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Saddled with high debt and pension liabilities, Kodak struggled for five more years before filing for bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

## Conclusion: Core Identity and Adaptation

The fundamental difference between the two companies lies in their core identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. Kodak was primarily a consumer brand with a strong technology base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. Fujifilm, conversely, began as a technology company that happened to sell to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. When their consumer businesses disappeared, Fujifilm found it easier to revert to its technological roots and adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. Kodak could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

Both Kodak and Fujifilm excelled in chemistry and manufacturing precision chemicals, but neither had expertise in producing semiconductors or electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. Fujifilm recognized this and chose to move on, leveraging its chemical expertise to [[Fujifilms diversification strategy | diversify into new businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. The company still retains "film" in its name as a nod to the origin of its technological expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. Kodak, however, remained stuck on its sinking ship, discarding potential life rafts and ultimately going down with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

The author recently traveled through Japan and the United States to gain a deeper understanding of the AI and AI chip boom landscape outside of Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This article shares insights gathered from those conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Trillion-Dollar Question

News emerged about a chip venture related to [[sam_altmans_ai_chip_venture | Sam Altman]] of OpenAI for the AI industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Initially reported as "billions" raised from Middle East investors around the time he was temporarily ousted from OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, subsequent reports indicated that [[sam_altmans_ai_chip_venture | Sam Altman]] and his team had engaged with TSMC, parties in Abu Dhabi, and the U.S. Government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

The Wall Street Journal later reported an attention-grabbing figure of $1-7 trillion, which sparked significant discussion upon the author's arrival in Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Many people found this number excessive, suggesting it might be a negotiating tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The Information clarified that [[sam_altmans_ai_chip_venture | Altman]] privately stated this figure represents the total investment needed from participants for an entire ecosystem, including real estate, power for data centers, and chip manufacturing, over several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Even with this broader definition, spreading a trillion dollars over five years and including real estate and power expenses still represents a significant, "COVID-like step function upwards" in capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The semiconductor industry, being conservative, has seen many boom and bust cycles, and [[sam_altmans_ai_chip_venture | Altman]] is not the first to claim a world-changing use case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

For context, total semiconductor sales in 2023 were around $520 billion, and total capital expenditures were about $140 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Scaling Laws

The concept driving this massive investment is known as "scaling laws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This term originates from a 2020 OpenAI paper titled "Scaling laws for neural language models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The core idea is that combining more data and compute leads to better results (i.e., less loss) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This principle was fundamental to OpenAI's development of the GPT-series models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI co-founder, noted that earlier neural networks were "too small" to be effective, and much larger networks enable unprecedented capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. GPT-3 was large, GPT-4 even larger and better, and GPT-5 is expected to be bigger still, with no signs that the scaling laws have broken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

The scaling laws bear interesting parallels with Moore's Law in the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. While not identical, both laws have the potential for similar profound effects on their respective industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Moore's Law served as a rallying cry for the semiconductor industry in the 1980s and 1990s, guiding R&D roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The scaling laws could have a similar impact on the AI industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

Arguments against the scaling laws exist, such as the concern that most existing internet data has already been utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. However, like Moore's Law, which faced and overcame physics problems through engineering solutions (e.g., High-K Metal Gate, FinFET) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, solutions can be found if sufficient investment is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## AI Chips & [[nvidia_and_competition_in_the_ai_chip_market | Nvidia]]

The significant profits in the AI chip market are attracting numerous competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Much has been written about [[nvidia_and_competition_in_the_ai_chip_market | Nvidia]] and the multi-pronged attack on its AI accelerator profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The author questions whether the [[nvidia_and_competition_in_the_ai_chip_market | Nvidia]] fortress will be as vulnerable as it might seem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, as [[nvidia_and_competition_in_the_ai_chip_market | Jensen]] (Huang) is aggressively ramping up annual updates to their accelerator lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This relentless pace echoes [[nvidia_and_competition_in_the_ai_chip_market | Nvidia]]'s strategy during the "Graphics Cards Wars," when new products were released every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

[[nvidia_and_competition_in_the_ai_chip_market | Nvidia]] can maintain this rapid rollout speed because, as [[nvidia_and_competition_in_the_ai_chip_market | Jensen]] implied, "they ship before they test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. They utilize advanced computer software design and emulation tools to model and ship new GPU designs without first fabricating a physical chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This approach allows them to avoid costly delays from finding software bugs after chip fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. While [[nvidia_and_competition_in_the_ai_chip_market | Nvidia]] aims for "perfect chips," this method can lead to initial problems for customers with drivers and associated software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. However, the [[nvidia_and_competition_in_the_ai_chip_market | Nvidia]] brand can withstand such issues, unlike smaller AI chip startups that take years to build a competent team and ship a working product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This high iteration speed, while difficult for customers who must buy what's available, gives [[nvidia_and_competition_in_the_ai_chip_market | Nvidia]] a competitive edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Giants and Verticalization

[[nvidia_and_competition_in_the_ai_chip_market | Nvidia]] is more concerned about tech giants like Microsoft and Google than about startups or established silicon players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. These giants are the primary drivers of current AI investment and have the greatest incentive to cut [[nvidia_and_competition_in_the_ai_chip_market | Nvidia]] out of their margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. They can achieve this through custom-designed chips or ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), a practice large companies have pursued since the early days of computers to save costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Examples include the Apple IIe, which used a custom ASIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, and the Google TPU (Tensor Processing Unit), now in its fourth iteration, which provides Google a significant compute advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Microsoft appears to be leading the charge in vertical integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. CEO Satya Nadella noted in the Q2 2024 earnings call that most usage in Azure AI services comes from inference rather than training, a task more easily shifted to custom-designed ASICs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Microsoft is also vertically integrating other parts of the database stack, such as developing a network card to shuttle data between servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This trend suggests either that the AI database stack is so large and costly that every penny counts, or that industry growth has slowed, forcing competition on price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

While it will take time for other tech giants to scale up their AI chip designs (the first Google TPU was very bare-bones) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, [[nvidia_and_competition_in_the_ai_chip_market | Nvidia]] will need to relentlessly pursue performance-cost leadership in the medium to long term as these custom chips improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## [[financial_sustainability_of_ai_investments | Financially Sustainable]]?

A major question is whether the current OpenAI boom is truly "Real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Despite impressive technological advancements, like OpenAI's text-to-video Sora model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>, the technology itself doesn't automatically translate into a hit product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The author questions if there are compelling products breaking through with actual consumer revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

Past massive investments driven by Moore's Law and the semiconductor industry were fueled by real demand from downstream industries: military, consumer electronics (radios, calculators), PCs, smartphones, and cloud computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. These were products ordinary people desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The author believes truly large AI investments won't happen unless ordinary consumers begin purchasing AI services in a significant way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

The Financial Times reported that ChatGPT hit a $2 billion run-rate revenue in December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, which is one of the few concrete indicators of people paying for an LLM service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. While the generative AI boom is still early (ChatGPT is just over a year old) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>, comparison to the iPhone's rapid consumer adoption and revenue growth (20 million iPhones sold for $13 billion in revenue by 2009, two years after release) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a> highlights the need for similar consumer breakthroughs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

Despite ChatGPT being one of the fastest-growing consumer tech products and generating 100 billion words daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, its high usage cost means it might have a "shorter leash" than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The industry is closely watching the Microsoft Copilot subscription service ($20/month) to see if it gains traction with consumers and enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Its success would signal a strong future for AI investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

### Conclusion

The "Real" impact of the LLM revolution might be in its embedding into existing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Some suggest overlooking AI's potential to supercharge advertising sales, citing examples like Google's Performance Max ads, which use AI for automated creation, deployment, and targeting, generating tens of billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Another example is Meta's ability to regain targeting accuracy after Apple's cookie tracking changes, using AI and its Conversions API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

This implies that the "killer app" for AI might simply be "more ads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This perspective aligns with Ben Thompson's view that AI is an enabling technology, making the rich richer rather than creating entirely new classes of wealth like the PC or electrification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. While potentially disappointing, this still makes the AI boom "nevertheless real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

The [[history_of_mitsubishi_regional_jet | Mitsubishi Regional Jet]], later rebranded as the Mitsubishi SpaceJet, faced a series of significant delays throughout its development, ultimately leading to the program's freezing in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. After six delays, over ten years of development, and nearly nine billion dollars spent, the program remains unrevived, with the subsidiary, Mitsubishi Aircraft, now insolvent and operating with a skeleton crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This marked a tough break for [[challenges_in_japans_aircraft_industry | Japan's first indigenous commercial aircraft]] in nearly half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Initial Plan and First Delay

The original plan in 2008 projected a 2013 launch date with a development budget of about $1.3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The first flight was initially scheduled for 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

However, in September 2009, the project's design changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. The main wings, initially designed to use a significant percentage of carbon-based composite materials, were changed to be made of aluminum, with only the rear wings retaining carbon composites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This reduced the plane's composite percentage from 30% to 10-15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The reason for this change is not entirely clear but might have been due to a lack of supply chain slack from Toray, a key composite supplier, or design-related issues concerning the high-impact forces experienced by regional jets during frequent takeoffs and landings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

This design change caused the **first delay**, pushing the first flight to the second quarter of 2012 and deliveries to early 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Supply Chain Struggles and Subsequent Delays

Despite locking the plane's design in 2010 and starting assembly in April 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, Mitsubishi struggled to build up its supply network for the MRJ over the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Aircraft parts are highly precise and difficult to manufacture, often made by a small group of specialized suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Unlike established manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus, Mitsubishi faced higher costs for parts, sometimes paying twice as much as Boeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

This led to the **second program delay** announced in April 2012, pushing the first flight over a year to the third quarter of 2013 and deliveries to mid-2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The program remained in the red, necessitating a revised sales target from 1,000 to 1,500 units, with the break-even point rising to 750 planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

In August 2013, the company announced its **third production delay**, stating a need for more time to work with supply partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This pushed the MRJ's first delivery back two more years, from mid-2015 to mid-2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Flight Tests and Certification Challenges

After the rollout ceremony in October 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a> and a successful first flight in November 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>, the rigorous process of internal and type certification flight tests began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This required at least 2,500 hours of flight tests, mostly in the United States, to meet standards across nearly 400 line items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

Reviewing this demanding schedule, Mitsubishi decided on a **fourth delay**, pushing first deliveries another year to the third quarter of 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Critically, this timing coincided with the release of Embraer's E2 series, which used the same Pratt & Whitney engine, eliminating the MRJ's previously touted 20% fuel consumption advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. By 2016, the program budget had ballooned to nearly $3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

## Documentation Issues and Organizational Changes

The certification tests proved highly challenging due to frequent misinterpretations and, crucially, a lack of proper documentation from Mitsubishi Aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This meant individual engineers adopted their own approaches, notably in electric wiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The company struggled to explain its wiring design to regulators due to insufficient documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Rather than attempting to rework 23,000 wires individually, the company decided to redo the entire wiring system, which was tantamount to a total internal redesign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

This major issue led to the **fifth delay**, pushing delivery dates to mid-2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Four of the five delays by this point were attributed to a "sloppy lack of documentation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. In response, Mitsubishi changed its organizational structure, hired more foreign engineers with aircraft experience, and granted them more decision-making power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. The president of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries took more direct control, and the subsidiary's president retired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

## Rebranding, Scope Clauses, and Final Pause

In June 2019, Mitsubishi rebranded the MRJ as the Mitsubishi SpaceJet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. The MRJ90 became the SpaceJet M90, and the MRJ70 was reworked into the SpaceJet M100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This change was a response to concerns from major American regional airline customers like SkyWest and Trans States Holdings, who held 70% of the order book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. These airlines operate under "scope clauses" in major airline pilot union contracts, which restrict regional aircraft seat numbers and maximum takeoff weights to protect main airline pilot earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. The M100 rework aimed to align with these clauses.

This rework naturally impacted the delivery schedule, leading to the **sixth delay** in late January 2020, pushing deliveries from mid-2020 to 2021 or beyond, as the new design required further certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

## Pandemic Impact and Program Freeze

Simultaneously, the global COVID-19 pandemic severely affected air travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. A SpaceJet unit's type certification flight was delayed in March 2020 due to pandemic lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

In May 2020, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries reported its first quarterly loss in 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Consequently, Mitsubishi halved its SpaceJet development plan, postponed production, reduced personnel, and closed its U.S. development centers, bringing work back to Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

A few months later, in October 2020, the company announced a three-year medium-term management plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. All development of the SpaceJet M90 would be paused, and 95% of employees at Mitsubishi Aircraft were laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. The company would only maintain its certification documentation while awaiting an anticipated air travel recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

## Conclusion

The odyssey of the Mitsubishi SpaceJet highlights the immense difficulty of building cutting-edge commercial aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. While the company made progress from 2003 to 2020, the cascade of delays, significantly driven by internal documentation and management issues, alongside external [[market_competition_in_regional_jet_sector | market competition]] and the global pandemic, ultimately led to its functional demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

Compared to [[comparison_between_mitsubishi_spacejet_and_chinas_arj21 | China's ARJ21]], which achieved its maiden flight in 2008 (six years after its start) and commercial flight in 2016 (eight years later), the SpaceJet also had its maiden flight about six years after its project start in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. However, the cumulative impact of its delays and the subsequent pause means a massive loss of experience, talent, and resources, making a revival highly challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

While extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography has made significant advancements, [[challenges_in_developing_commercial_euv_systems | substantial challenges]] remain, particularly concerning photoresist and metrology systems for next-generation [[innovations_in_optical_systems_for_high_na_euv | High NA EUV]] machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. These are key engineering challenges associated with [[innovations_in_optical_systems_for_high_na_euv | High NA EUV]] technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

## Photoresist Challenges

The photoresist is a crucial component, applied on top of the substrate before it is exposed to EUV light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. After exposure, either the exposed portions (negative photoresist) or the non-exposed portions (positive photoresist) are retained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>.

A primary challenge with [[innovations_in_optical_systems_for_high_na_euv | High NA EUV]] is the requirement for thinner resist layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. This is critical to mitigate the risk of pattern collapse or line collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. If the resist is too thick, the lines created after EUV exposure will be too close together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.

The process involves washing the wafer and removing the resist after exposure, followed by drying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. If the lines do not dry uniformly, the surface tension of the water can distort the intricate design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>, potentially causing lines to fall over or peel off the substrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

To prevent these issues, the target is a resist layer that is at least 50% thicker than the pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. For example, a 16 nanometer pitch requires a 20 nanometer thick resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. Companies are actively developing new resist materials to meet these demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>. [[ASML and highvolume EUV systems | ASML]] is collaborating with partners such as imec, psi, and cxro to identify suitable candidates, with work ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>.

## Metrology Challenges

Beyond optics and photoresist, metrology presents another significant engineering challenge for [[innovations_in_optical_systems_for_high_na_euv | High NA EUV]] systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. Metrology refers to the system of sensors and programs that continuously monitor progress and quality during fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. It is crucial for ensuring the quality of the lines on the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>.

The primary difficulty lies in inspecting structures that are less than 20 nanometers wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>. To address this, [[ASML and highvolume EUV systems | ASML]] is investigating e-beam inspection techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>, though this technology has not yet been finalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>.

The overarching challenge is transforming existing technologies into shippable, competitive products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. The first [[innovations_in_optical_systems_for_high_na_euv | High NA EUV]] machines, such as the EXE 5000, are anticipated to be delivered to customers in late 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>, with an improved EXE 5200 version expected by 2024 or 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>. These machines are massive, comparable in size to a crouched T-Rex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>, and will command a price tag exceeding 300 million dollars each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>.

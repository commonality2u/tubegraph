The narrative of [[legacy_and_impact_of_an_wang_and_wang_labs | Wang Labs]] is intrinsically linked to the exceptional talent of its founder, [[contributions_of_an_wang_to_computing | An Wang]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. An incredible engineer and brilliant businessman, Wang Labs ascended due to his foresight in creating future technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It is an American success story of an immigrant from China who arrived with nothing and amassed a fortune before losing it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This article details the rise of this computing pioneer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## An Wang's Early Life and Education

An Wang was born in Shanghai in 1920 to an upper-middle-class family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. His father was an educated teacher and practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. During a period of chaos in China, Wang's family frequently relocated to avoid conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Wang began schooling in the third grade, always being two years younger than his classmates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Despite this, he excelled in math and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. At nine, he decided to take junior high exams himself and placed first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. At 13, he tested into Shanghai Provincial High School (now Shanghai High School) and left his family to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. He continued to be brilliant in math and science but struggled with Chinese and English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. After testing in the top 10 of his class, Wang earned a scholarship to Chaotong University (China's MIT) at just 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

During Japan's invasion of China in late 1936, the university and Wang's family fled to the French concession of Shanghai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Despite personal tragedies, including the deaths of his mother, father, and older sister, Wang graduated first in his class in 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

After graduation, Wang joined the Chinese Central Radio Corporation, building radios for the Chinese Army in Guilin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. In 1944, after the Japanese overran Guilin, Wang fled to Chongqing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. There, he won a government test to study in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Harvard and the Invention of Core Memory

Wang arrived in the United States in 1945 and entered Harvard to study Applied Physics, where he found the work easy and earned a PhD in just 13 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. After his PhD, Wang joined the Harvard Computation Lab, working on the Mark I, then one of the world's most powerful computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

He pondered how to store and read large amounts of information without clumsy mechanical steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Magnetic tapes demagnetified upon reading, destroying the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Wang realized that destroying information during reading was not an issue if it could be immediately rewritten without speed sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This concept became magnetic core memory, the predecessor to the magnetic drum and ancestor of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. In 1949, with his wife Lorraine's encouragement, Wang applied for a patent for this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This angered his Harvard colleagues, who believed such knowledge should be public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Founding Wang Laboratories

In 1950, Harvard began moving away from fields with commercial applications like computers, a decision Wang disagreed with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. He decided to start his own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Despite friends' attempts to dissuade him due to the prevalent racism, his English challenges, and lack of money, Wang had unshakable confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. He named the company after himself, never entertaining changing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Wang quit Harvard in April 1951, giving up a $5,400 annual salary just as his first son was born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Wang Laboratories was founded on June 30, 1951, with just $600 in savings and Wang as its sole asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. He began by producing and selling core memories for about four dollars each, handling all sales himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. In 1952, he contacted IBM about licensing his pending core memory patent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Early on, Wang supplemented his income by teaching a night course, but his reputation grew, attracting custom consulting jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. In 1953, he secured a deal with IBM for consulting revenue and a future option to buy his patent, providing the company with stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

In 1955, IBM paid Wang $400,000-$500,000 (roughly $4.4-$5.5 million today) for his patent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This money allowed Wang to shift from consulting to product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Early Product Successes

In the early 1960s, Wang partnered with Compugraphic to design and produce the Linasec, a machine that justified text lines for publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The Linasec was a hit, with Wang Laboratories' revenue growing from $427,000 in 1962 to $1.4 million in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. However, a dispute over pricing and patent ownership with Compugraphic led Wang to vow never to produce a product he didn't fully control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

Wang's first fully controlled hit came in 1964 with a new calculator, capitalizing on the shift from mechanical to solid-state electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. He aimed for a calculator far smaller than a mainframe but with similar capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Wang and a colleague developed a patented transistor logic capable of deriving natural logarithmic values using just six pre-stored values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This resulted in the Logarithmic Calculating Instrument (LOCI), debuted in January 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. The LOCI was powerful and sold well to science labs, but its intimidating keyboard required knowledge of logarithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

Wang then developed the Wang 300 calculator, introduced in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Easy to use and costing $1,695, it was an immediate success, selling to scientists, researchers, stockbrokers, and insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. The Wang 300 became legendary on Wall Street for uncovering a three-decade-old error in a bond trading table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Revenues nearly tripled from $2.5 million in 1965 to $6.9 million in 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. That year, Wang Laboratories went public in a highly publicized IPO, making Wang's personal stock holdings worth $50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

## Transition to Computers and Breakthrough Products

Despite calculator success, Wang sought the next big thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. The advent of the BASIC computer language in 1968 convinced him that computers were the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Wang acquired Phil Hankins Inc. to help develop two new computers: the Wang 700 and the Wang 3300 BASIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. In response to Hewlett-Packard's new HP 9100 calculator (which was effectively a computer), Wang rushed out the 700 in mid-1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. A year after its production, the 700 became Wang's most important product, boosting revenues to $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

By 1971, the calculator market was becoming challenging, with the Wang 300 declining in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. That year, Intel introduced its first microprocessor, leading analysts to predict that entire calculators could fit on a single chip, driving prices down significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Anticipating this storm, Wang made the "incredibly ballsy decision" in 1971 to exit the calculator market, despite it making up 75% of the company's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

Wang pursued a two-pronged computer strategy: a general-purpose computer (the Wang 3300 Basic) and a word processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. The 3300, released in 1970, was not successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. The first word processor, the Wang 1200, announced in November 1971, was a modified Wang 700 calculator connected to an IBM Selectric typewriter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. Reliability issues caused sales to slump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

Three products brought Wang Labs back to prominence:
*   **Wang 2200 (1973):** Successor to the 3300, it used BASIC for easy programmability and Intel's ROM chips for instant wake capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Priced between $6,000-$8,000, it became a capable and affordable small business computer, selling well for a decade and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
*   **Wang Word Processing System (WPS) (1976):** Learning from the 1200's shortcomings, Harold Koplow and David Morris redesigned the system from the ground up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. It featured a network of powerful machines, each with its own Intel 8080 microprocessor, capable of independent work and sharing documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. They ditched the IBM Selectric, instead using a CRT screen for display, and simplified the user interface with built-in prompts and a menu system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. The WPS was an immediate hit, bringing the company back from the brink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. At its introduction, huge lines formed to see the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   **Wang VS Minicomputer (1977):** Smaller and cheaper than IBM's mainframes, the VS minicomputer was powerful enough for commercial applications like spreadsheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. It competed with Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX line and held its own, modeled after an IBM 360 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

These three products, released in quick succession, would generate billions for Wang Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

## Marketing and Explosive Growth

By the late 1970s, Wang was the world's largest supplier of CRT-based word processing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>, yet largely unknown as a computer maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. In 1978, the company launched a massive three-month TV ad blitz, positioning itself as a leading computer maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. This culminated in a 30-second Super Bowl ad costing $150,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. Despite being only the 32nd largest computer maker, Wang was the only company besides IBM advertising on TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Their attention-grabbing "David vs. Goliath" spot directly attacked IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. Tens of millions saw it, putting Wang on the map and increasing awareness from 3% to 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

The campaign was so successful that executives were afraid to disclose how well it worked to discourage copycats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. Wang's revenues doubled from 1978 to 1980, and again from 1980 to 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Sales reached $1 billion in 1982 and $2 billion in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. By 1983, 80% of the US's biggest firms bought Wang equipment, with nearly half of the company's revenue coming from Fortune 500 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

## The Beginning of Decline

An Wang turned 60 in 1980 and began to slow down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. In 1982, he reduced his time in the office, and formally retired in 1983, remaining chairman while John A. Cunningham took the head spot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. Wang's desire to pass control to his son, Fred Wang, eventually led to internal turmoil and strategic missteps that marked the beginning of [[the_decline_and_fall_of_wang_labs | Wang Labs]]' downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Wang's resistance to the personal computer (PC) revolution and his focus on specialized hardware proved to be critical [[business_strategies_and_challenges_of_wang_labs | challenges]] the company could not overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

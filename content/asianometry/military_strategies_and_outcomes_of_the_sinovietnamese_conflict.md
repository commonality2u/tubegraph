On the morning of February 17, 1979, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) commenced shelling the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, followed by an incursion of 100,000 People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops across the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These forces swept through border areas, capturing several cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This military invasion, known as the [[sinovietnamese_war_of_1979 | Sino-Vietnamese War of 1979]], was the culmination of numerous offenses and disputes that escalated into open conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Background to the Conflict

Despite sharing Marxist ideologies and having been allies who collaborated against imperialist French and American forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, a growing chasm had developed between Vietnam and China since the Vietnamese Communist Party reunified the country after the Vietnam War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

[[historical_tensions_between_china_and_vietnam | Historical tensions between China and Vietnam]] spanned centuries, including a nearly 1,000-year period of colonization and a 20-year invasion by the Ming Dynasty in the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. The Vietnamese perceived Chinese intentions as impure, viewing China as treating them as a junior partner rather than an equal, which caused friction whenever Vietnam asserted independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

China had provided substantial aid to Vietnam during the war against the United States, nearly $20 billion, but this aid came with the condition that Vietnam could not accept assistance from the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. The Chinese were angered by what they saw as Hanoi’s lack of gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. This, combined with escalating border clashes and explosions involving ethnic Chinese in Vietnam, led [[deng_xiaopings_leadership_and_its_influence_on_chinese_foreign_policy | Deng Xiaoping]]'s China to believe that Vietnam deserved a "lesson" for its "insolence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

An additional factor was the Chinese Communist Party's desire to improve relations with the West and distance itself further from the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. China viewed the Soviet Union as its primary foreign policy threat, stemming from the [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | Sino-Soviet Split]] that began with disputes between Mao and Khrushchev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Soviet military buildup and exercises near the Sino-Soviet borders further solidified Chinese distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

## Deng Xiaoping's Role and Military Objectives

In July 1977, [[deng_xiaopings_leadership_and_its_influence_on_chinese_foreign_policy | Deng Xiaoping]] emerged as China's paramount leader, holding key titles within the Communist Party and military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. He consolidated power by ushering in a more moderate agenda focused on economic modernization and opening up to the outside world, which included warming relations with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Invading Vietnam was seen as a way to demonstrate the sincerity of China's intentions to the global community and prove the PLA's competence to fight alongside Western forces against Soviet influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

[[deng_xiaopings_leadership_and_its_influence_on_chinese_foreign_policy | Deng Xiaoping]] single-handedly drove the war effort against Vietnam, appearing to harbor an irrational grudge against the Vietnamese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. With no one in a position to question him, the war proceeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Deng specifically instructed the army to limit the war's scope to achieving China's political goals, aiming to prevent entanglement similar to America's experience in Vietnam and to keep the Soviet Union from intervening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

### War Stages and Troop Allocation

The war was planned in two stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>:
*   **First Stage (February 17-25)**: A two-pronged offensive targeting Cao Bang and Lao Cai, with a simultaneous hit on Dong Dang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
*   **Second Stage (February 26-March 5)**: PLA forces would converge on Lang Son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

Upon completion of these stages, the Chinese army would withdraw and declare victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. The PLA allocated approximately 330,000 men for the predominantly land-based attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.

## PLA Preparations and Initial Offensive

The Vietnamese high command was reportedly baffled by the impending PLA strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. However, Chinese propaganda had already been active, denouncing the Vietnamese as "dogs of the Soviet Union" and the "Cuba of the East" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. A massive evacuation of 300,000 civilians from Soviet border zones (Heilongjiang and Xinjiang) was undertaken to guard against a Soviet counterattack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.

At the time, most of Vietnam’s experienced troops were in Cambodia suppressing military action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. The remaining forces to oppose the PLA were approximately 150,000 Vietnamese regular forces, primarily regional security and militia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. Chinese Central Command's military assessments ignored these militias, leading them to assume an overwhelming 8-to-1 numerical advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. This miscalculation proved costly, as the Vietnamese local forces were well-trained and equipped, making the actual advantage closer to 2-to-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

On February 17, 1979, at 5 AM, an artillery barrage initiated the invasion along the Sino-Vietnamese border, followed by 100,000 soldiers and tank units advancing towards Lang Son, Cao Bang, and Lao Cai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. Lao Cai was a crucial target due to its railroad link to Hanoi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

Crucially, there was no air support, as Deng and Central Command restricted Chinese flying missions to Chinese airspace for political reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. This top-down command structure also prevented middle and lower-ranking officers from making independent judgments or adapting to conditions, forcing the PLA to use human waves against fortifications, resulting in thousands of casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Progress

Through sheer numerical superiority, the PLA advanced 10 miles into Vietnamese territory, capturing several border towns and pushing towards Lao Cai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. They encountered the Vietnamese "Flying Tiger Regiment" en route to Dong Dang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

Beijing publicly reported "very heavy" losses on the Vietnamese side by February 20, claiming 10,000 Vietnamese wounded or killed compared to 2,000-3,000 Chinese casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.

However, the PLA also faced significant difficulties. Soldiers quickly learned, as Americans had before them, the challenges of jungle fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. The PLA was ill-prepared for these conditions and suffered immense casualties from:
*   Tunnel and jungle warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>
*   Booby traps, landmines, and bamboo stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>
*   Well-armed militias utilizing fortified tunnels, caves, and trenches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>

Rain bogged down operations, forcing PLA troops to rely on horses and donkeys for transport through difficult terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. Infantry soldiers tied themselves to tanks to avoid falling off, making them easy targets during ambushes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. Tank units suffered particularly heavy losses, with 87% experiencing damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

Despite these challenges, the PLA captured Lao Cai (the city with the railway) and Cao Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. By February 21-22, both Chinese and Vietnamese forces reinforced their positions and converged on Lang Son, where the heaviest fighting occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.

## Capture of Lang Son and Withdrawal

Lang Son, only 85 miles from Hanoi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>, was approached by two PLA divisions from Dang Dong and Loc Binh, cutting off all roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. Following Mao's strategy for urban battles, the PLA first occupied the surrounding countryside to avoid getting bogged down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. By March 2, the city was mostly surrounded, with thousands of corpses littering the highways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>. The last remaining area to the south was the Khua Ma Son mountains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.

On March 3, the PLA launched an attack to capture the Khua Ma Son area, using tanks and infantry to swarm a fortified hill, which was captured in just 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>. They then destroyed adjacent Vietnamese artillery positions, completing the encirclement and capture of Lang Son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.

[[deng_xiaopings_leadership_and_its_influence_on_chinese_foreign_policy | Deng Xiaoping]] and the Chinese high command had emphasized from the outset that the excursion would be brief, publicly stating it was a limited war with limited aims: to keep Vietnam in line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. They recognized that a prolonged conflict risked intervention from larger powers, particularly the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. This strategy succeeded, as the Soviets largely stayed out of the conflict as long as its scale remained "limited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.

On March 5, Beijing announced its withdrawal, claiming to have "advanced 30 ... to 80 miles, taken the capitals of Lang Son, Cao Bang, and Lao Cai and 17 other countries and cities, and damaged severely 4 regular divisions and 10 regiments of the enemy forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. Having achieved its political goals, the PLA began to withdraw, and the Vietnamese allowed an orderly retreat to avoid escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. The Communist Party was commended for sticking to its word, preventing the conflict from escalating into a larger war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.

## Military Doctrine, Performance, and Outcomes

[[deng_xiaopings_leadership_and_its_influence_on_chinese_foreign_policy | Deng Xiaoping]], while a different political leader than Mao, shared similar military strategies focused on annihilating enemy forces, often by encirclement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>. A key general in the war was instructed to "use a butcher’s knife to kill a chick," meaning to employ sharp, decisive strikes to destroy the enemy's vital areas while avoiding their strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.

The Chinese command was willing to endure heavy losses to seize strategic advantages. Even against well-fortified Vietnamese defenses, Chinese infantrymen were pushed into massed close combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>. Despite constant requests from army commanders for aerial bombing support, Central Command's political restrictions meant flights were limited to Chinese airspace, leaving infantry to suffer immense casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>.

### Casualties

Varying sources provide different casualty figures for the PLA.
*   Beijing initially reported 20,000 killed or wounded during the three-week battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>.
*   Hanoi claimed to have inflicted about 42,000 casualties on the Chinese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>.
*   Other estimates suggest 25,000 PLA killed and 37,000 wounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>.
*   Another estimate cites just 6,900 dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>.

Regardless of the exact numbers, a significant number of Chinese soldiers perished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. In comparison, the United States suffered 356,962 killed or wounded over 20 years in Vietnam, a number the PLA would have reached in about a year at its stated rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>.

### PLA Underperformance

Internal Chinese documents acknowledged that the PLA underperformed operationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. Army planners had arrogantly claimed they could take Hanoi in a week with a fraction of their forces, but it took 16 days and 10 full divisions to cover only a third of that distance, and they didn't even face the main Vietnamese army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>. The PLA's weapons were outdated, tactics needed modernization from Mao's era, and morale was low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. The rigid top-down command structure led to situations where units were "forced" to advance, making soldiers feel their lives were being wasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>.

The [[sinovietnamese_war_of_1979 | Sino-Vietnamese War of 1979]] highlights the Chinese Communist Party's view of war and the PLA as tools to achieve political goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. If the Party's political objectives are met, the PLA is considered successful, regardless of military performance or casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>. This approach bears resemblance to tactics used by the Red Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>. The Party believed it successfully delivered a message to Vietnam, thus deeming the PLA's mission a success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>.

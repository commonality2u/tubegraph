At the time of Japan's opening up, the global watch market was primarily dominated by the United States and Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The United States focused on mass-producing simple, inexpensive pocket watches using screw automation technology adapted from sewing machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. In contrast, the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss watch industry]] consisted of numerous small companies producing a diverse range of high-precision timepieces, primarily for export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Switzerland held approximately 93% of the pocket watch export market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Japan's Entry into Timepiece Manufacturing

Japan's modernization efforts in the late 19th century led to a rapid adoption of Western technologies, including timepieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Initially, imported watches were luxury goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. However, clocks, being technologically simpler, became the focus of Japan's early domestic production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Hayashi Shii opened Japan's first modern clock factory in 1888, leading to a rapid increase in clock manufacturing competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Production volume surged from 37,460 pieces in 1905 to 1.2 million in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. By the 1930s, Japan became a significant clock exporting power, holding 35% of the total market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This period of growth is part of the broader [[history_of_japanese_watch_industry_development | History of Japanese watch industry development]]

As pocket watches gained popularity in Japan, domestic companies sought to produce them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Hattori Kintaro, who would found Hattori Co. (later Seiko), began by repairing and reselling imported Swiss and American watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. In 1895, Hattori opened his own factory, Seikosha, initially making wall clocks and high-end grandfather clocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Challenges in Mechanical Watch Production
Mechanical watches require small, precision-made parts and painstaking assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Early Japanese watches struggled to compete with Swiss and American imports in terms of thinness, accuracy, reliability, and cost-effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Impact of Trade Policies and Expertise Acquisition
The landscape shifted when an unequal treaty between Japan and the United States lapsed in 1899, allowing Japan to regain sovereignty over its trade relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The Japanese government immediately implemented an [[role_of_tariffs_and_trade_policies_in_watch_industry | import substitution policy]] by significantly raising tariffs on finished watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. For example, tariffs on silver and nickel watch imports rose from 5% before 1899 to 25% and then 40% by 1906 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This protection allowed Hattori's watchmaking business to flourish, capturing 85% of the domestic watch market between 1906 and 1930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

Hattori improved manufacturing capacity by automating the production of a few selected Swiss-inspired models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. To gain expertise, Hattori hired engineers to disassemble Swiss watches and learn their construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Crucially, Japan sourced raw watch parts from Switzerland, which were not subject to tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This practice, known as "shablon" (named after the word for movement sets), involved importing disassembled watch movements and assembling them within Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

From 1895 to 1899, Japan imported 22,500 watch movements. However, after the tariffs on finished watches, imports of movements surged to 122,000 in 1900 and 250,000 by 1905, far exceeding finished watch imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The Swiss watch industry became concerned, viewing shablon as a long-term threat that transferred critical watchmaking expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. One notable example is Rudolph Schmidt, a Swiss citizen who settled in Yokohama. After tariffs increased, he shifted from importing complete watches to importing shablon and assembling them in Japan, eventually moving the entire case-making process to Japan by 1910 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Schmidt later acquired a workshop that became Citizen Watch Company, which grew to be the second significant Japanese watchmaker after Hattori/Seiko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. By 1935, Hattori's watch factory was the single largest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

In response to declining exports, the Swiss reorganized their industry into a cartel in the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Part suppliers signed agreements to only do business with each other, and a holding company, ASAG, was set up to acquire movement manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. In 1934, the Swiss government stepped in, controlling all watchmaking activities and monitoring exports of parts and machine tools, effectively making shablon illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This allowed the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss watch industry]] to enjoy high profits and a consistent 50% share of the global market for the next few decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## The Quartz Revolution

The 1930s saw a market shift from pocket watches to wristwatches, along with the addition of features like self-winding movements, calendars, and waterproof cases, all while becoming smaller and more complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

Then came World War II, which halted watch production for most companies except the Swiss, who remained neutral and gained a leg up in the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. After the war, American watch companies struggled against cheap Swiss imports despite new tariffs, leading to a long-term decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Hattori Co. (Seiko) pushed hard to compete, copying Swiss machine tools, studying their methods, and exploiting loopholes in the cartel system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. By 1966, Hattori produced mechanical watches that performed as well as their Swiss counterparts, establishing themselves as world leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

However, the major [[transition_from_mechanical_to_quartz_watches | transition from mechanical to quartz watches]] was on the horizon. The principles of quartz technology date back to Pierre Curie's 1880s discovery that applying pressure or alternating current to a quartz crystal causes it to vibrate consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This property could make timepieces far more accurate than mechanical ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. In 1927, a Bell Labs engineer created a high-precision, room-sized quartz clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

### The Electronic Watch Precursor: Bulova Accutron
In 1960, Bulova, one of the two remaining major American watchmakers, released the Accutron, the first commercial electronic watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. It used a 360 Hz tuning fork, making it 10 times more accurate than a mechanical watch with fewer discrete parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Max Hetzel, a Swiss scientist, developed this technology after failing to interest Swiss companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Bulova, however, stuck to tuning fork technology, missing the future shift to quartz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Nonetheless, the Accutron spurred a surge of technological development in electronic watches across the US, Japan, and Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

### Seiko's Quartz Innovation
In 1959, Hattori (now Seiko) formed a team to commercialize quartz timekeepers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. The [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor's]] commercialization enabled small circuits to power quartz crystals, measure oscillations, and translate them into second pulses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Their first goal was a portable quartz chronometer for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, which they successfully delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

Next, they aimed to miniaturize the technology into a wristwatch. Without access to advanced [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | integrated circuits]], Seiko created a hand-soldered hybrid circuit using 76 transistors, 29 condensers, and 84 resistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. They outsourced the CMOS production process to American firm Interel, which transferred its process knowledge to Seiko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Seiko also tapped into the capacity of major Japanese transistor producers like Hitachi, NEC, and Toshiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

The Seiko Astron SQ went on sale in Tokyo on Christmas Day 1969, priced at what would be $31,000 today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Seiko marketed the Astron with the line, "Someday all watches will be made this way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

### The Rise of Digital LED and LCD Watches
While the Astron was revolutionary, its initial sales were modest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. A further technological leap came from Hamilton Watch in Pennsylvania, which developed a quartz watch using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. They ditched hands and dials, displaying time and date digitally. Hamilton's "Pulsar," released first in gold in 1972, was marketed as a "wrist computer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Its popularity surged after James Bond wore a P2 version in "Live and Let Die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

By the mid-1970s, LED quartz watches became the market standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. They later gave way to LCD watches due to better battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. Integrated circuit firms and traditional watch companies rushed into the digital quartz watch category, seeing it as a "killer app" for their chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Texas Instruments, for example, sold digital LED watches alongside calculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Even Intel briefly entered the market, acquiring digital watchmaker Microma in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. Casio, originally a calculator company, competed at the low end against firms like Timex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

## Market Shift and Industry Repercussions
Japanese watch exports, particularly into the critical US market, exploded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. Export value grew nearly tenfold, reaching $26 million in 1975, with watches accounting for nearly 20% of total Japanese exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. In contrast, Swiss exports stagnated, and their market share plummeted from 83% at the start of the 1970s to just 20% in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. By 1985, Japanese watch exports to the US totaled $373 million, with Seiko, Citizen, and Casio effectively pushing the Swiss out of their most valuable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

The Swiss watch industry "fumbled" the shift to quartz despite being aware of the technology and even demoing their own prototypes in 1967, two years before the Astron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. Their pride in mechanical heritage and a sprawling industry structure of many small firms hindered their ability to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. A mechanical watch requires trained artisans and painstaking effort, but a digital watch made with modern [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | semiconductor production methods]] overwhelms this human training with "titanic scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

Quartz watches ended the Swiss grip on the global watch industry. Their market share shrank from 40% in 1974 to just 10% ten years later, and over half of Swiss watchmakers went bankrupt by 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. Out of necessity, the Swiss also shifted to quartz technologies, and for a brief period, mechanical watch production techniques seemed at risk of being lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. However, the Swiss mechanical watch industry has since made a comeback, recognizing the value of their products beyond accurate timekeeping. They restructured into the Swatch Group, creating luxury watch brands and thriving in this niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

The Japanese watch industry, on the other hand, peaked in the 1980s. Challenged by industrial competitors in Hong Kong and China, the industry stagnated and relocated manufacturing abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

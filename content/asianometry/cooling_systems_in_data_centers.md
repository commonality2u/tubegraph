Data centers generate a significant amount of heat as almost all consumed electricity is converted into heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Even when not operating at full capacity, data centers withdraw 60-100% of their maximum power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. To prevent long-term damage, electronic equipment must be kept cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. For example, hard disk drives require temperatures around 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit), while solid-state compute and storage chips have higher limits of 85 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The primary role of a cooling system is to maintain a stable temperature and humidity within the data center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

[[energy_efficiency_in_data_centers | Energy efficiency in data centers]] are measured by Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Larger hyperscale data centers tend to have lower PUE values, often between 1.1 and 1.2, compared to smaller facilities which might have a PUE of 2.5 or so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This difference is largely due to the more efficient cooling systems that hyperscale data centers can afford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Types of Cooling Systems
Cooling systems generally fall into two categories: air and liquid cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Air Cooling Systems
Most data centers utilize air cooling, often as part of a raised-floor system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Structure**: Racks are elevated 2-4 feet above the ground, with the underfloor area primarily used for cold air circulation, along with some cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Operation**: Cold air is discharged from the Computer Room Air Conditioner (CRAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This air is guided into cold aisles, where it absorbs heat from the servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The now hot air rises and is collected for transfer to fluid heat exchangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Fluid Loops**: A common system involves two fluid loops:
    *   **Process Loop**: A fluid refrigerant (usually water and glycol) takes heat from the data room floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   **Condenser Loop**: The heat is then transferred to a water-based condenser loop for final transfer outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    This two-loop system, similar to those in nuclear power plants, prevents contamination and offers greater operating flexibility and efficiency, though at a higher cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Cooling Towers**: A set of cooling towers cools the water in the final loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Hot water flows down inside the tower, and some evaporates, releasing energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The cooled water then returns to the system for reuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   **[[water_consumption_in_data_centers | Water Consumption]]**: Evaporated water leaves the tower as steam, with approximately 1% evaporation for every 10 degrees Fahrenheit (5.6 degrees Celsius) of cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This evaporated water must be replaced with new, "make-up" water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. [[water_consumption_in_data_centers | Water usage]] can be thousands of gallons for evaporative cooling towers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Liquid Cooling Systems
Hyperscale data centers may employ liquid cooling systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Liquid is significantly more effective at capturing and transferring heat than air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>, which can lead to reduced overall [[energy_efficiency in data centers | energy consumption]] and improved processor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. These systems can involve directly bringing cold liquid to the chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Cooling Strategies and Innovations

### Free Cooling
"Free cooling" involves using ambient outdoor conditions to cool data centers, reducing the need for traditional HVAC systems and significant [[water_consumption_in_data_centers | water evaporation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Direct Free Cooling**: The simplest form is using outside air directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. However, outdoor air often contains smoke, dust, and gases that can harm electronics, necessitating dehumidification, air filtration, and cleaning systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. The energy savings depend on the location's climate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Studies in Europe found average energy savings of 5.4-7.9%, while studies in Australia showed up to 60% savings in southern capital cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:10:04]</a>. Cold climates, particularly in Nordic countries, are attractive for data center investment due to these advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Waterside Free Cooling**: Data centers located near cold seas can use seawater to cool their systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Google's Hamina data center in Finland, a converted paper mill, uses existing pipes to take in fresh seawater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Due to the two-loop cooling system, the seawater does not mix with the internal fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>; it is used to cool the process loop fluid and then mixed with more seawater before being returned to the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

### Heat Recapture
This involves recovering the heat generated by data centers and reusing it for other purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Applications**: Recaptured heat can be used for desalinating water, pre-heating water in thermoelectric plants, direct power generation, or piping it to homes for general heating or hot water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Feasibility**: Captured heat from air-cooled data centers can be hot enough (35-45 degrees Celsius) for these applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Space and water heating account for about 6% of America's total [[energy_efficiency in data centers | energy consumption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **Challenges**: The main challenges are the inability to efficiently move heat over long distances, requiring demand sources (households) to be relatively close to the data center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Additionally, many cities lack the necessary district heating infrastructure of insulated pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Nordic countries have made significant progress in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### Temperature Ranges
The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends a temperature range of 15 to 32 degrees Celsius for data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Some operators run cooler, assuming better performance, but raising a data center's temperature by even 1-2 degrees can yield significant financial benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Google has conducted tests showing their data centers can operate at higher temperatures, though some contradictory results suggest hard drives might perform worse in cooler conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

## Impact of the AI Boom
The current AI boom is causing massive data centers to ramp up faster, leading to increased [[impact_of_data_centers_on_water_and_energy_resources | energy]] and [[water_consumption_in_data_centers | water consumption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Microsoft's 2022 water consumption for its data centers leapt 34% from 2021, a jump likely attributable to generative AI products like ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. New AI hardware, such as Nvidia's upcoming GPU products like the B100, are becoming even more power-hungry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Training and deploying these models will require immense scale, leading to increased power and [[water_consumption_in_data_centers | water consumption]] for cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

The future of compute and AI will necessitate the rapid adoption of combined strategies, including free-cooling, waste heat recovery, and renewable energy sources like solar, to manage the growing demand for electricity and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

The [[semiconductor_industry_water_usage | semiconductor industry]] faces significant challenges related to water, not only in its consumption but also in the management of its wastewater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. As process nodes become more advanced, the demand for cleanliness increases, leading to higher water consumption and more complex wastewater issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Nature of Semiconductor Wastewater

Semiconductor manufacturing processes, particularly the extensive wafer washing steps, generate a substantial amount of wastewater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This wastewater contains a high amount of pollutants, including ammonia, phosphate, and fluoride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Exposure to these chemicals has been linked to health concerns for workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

For context, in 2013, TSMC's fabs in Tainan generated 19 million tons of wastewater, while the entire city of Tainan generated 29 million tons in the same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Wastewater Treatment Processes

Not all wastewater generated by fabs is the same; some requires more expensive and extensive treatments than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

*   **Treatment Methods**
    *   **Ultraviolet Light:** Relatively cheap and used for disinfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
    *   **Reverse Electrodialysis:** A more costly method where salt ions are transported through a membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   **Advanced Filtration:** Procedures like reverse osmosis, hollow fiber ultrafiltration, and sand filtration are used in water reclamation plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. These are similar to Singapore's "New Water" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

Large foundries like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel separate different wastewater streams and apply specialized treatments to address over 25 chemicals in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This multi-step system is complex and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. For smaller companies, it is often more cost-effective to broadly treat the water and return it to the city once minimum health and safety requirements are met, then source new raw water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Water Reuse and Recycling

After treatment, some of the water output is reusable and can be fed back into the system to generate more [[ultra_pure_water_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ultra pure water]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. However, some treated water is not reusable and is typically put into cooling towers where it is evaporated to help maintain fab temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Cooling towers represent the single biggest use of a facility's energy and water after direct manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Large fabs must implement water reuse and recycling technologies due to their scale; without them, they would quickly run out of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

*   **Recycle Rates:**
    *   TSMC's recycle rate in 2017 was 87% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
    *   The average [[semiconductor_industry_water_usage | semiconductor fab]] recycled less than half of that, 42%, in 2017 according to a Singapore study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

Despite advancements in water reuse and conservation, the cutting-edge chips of today actually require more water to fabricate than those made 10 years earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This trend is likely to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Company-Specific Efforts: TSMC in Taiwan

Taiwan, especially areas like Tainan and Shinchu, has faced severe droughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In 2019, TSMC's fabs in Tainan alone consumed 50,000 metric tons (50 million liters) of water daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The area relies on the Nan Hua and Zheng One reservoirs, which have dangerously low capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Taiwan's south is also a critical agricultural region, further competing for water resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

To manage water supply, TSMC has optimized its water draw and usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Beyond internal recycling:
*   **Rain Collection:** The company has built large rain collection systems to capture rainwater and store it in 700-ton tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. After checks, this water can be processed, used for landscaping, or sent to sewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Water Reclamation Plants:** TSMC has signed tenders to build water reclamation plants near its fabs, particularly in the Tainan Science Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Additional capacity is expected from future plants in the Yeongkong and Unping areas of Tainan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

## Economic and Policy Considerations

Even in arid regions like Arizona, where TSMC and Intel are building fabs, governments are incentivized to attract [[semiconductor_industry_water_usage | semiconductor manufacturing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. High-volume [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | semiconductor manufacturing]] is a highly profitable and high value-add industry, making states willing to bear the costs of water infrastructure or reallocate water from other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. A 2012 study in Chandler, Arizona, showed that the [[economic_impacts_of_semiconductor_facilities_on_water_resources | economic benefits]] from [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | semiconductor manufacturing]] outweighed the costs of providing water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

The ability of the industry to invest in advanced water saving, reusing, and recycling techniques means a high percentage of water is theoretically returned to the wastewater system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This, combined with other advantages like an educated workforce, tax incentives, and seismic stability, outweighs the simple lack of water in such regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Governments are incentivized to divert water, often from agriculture, to these high-value industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

<h5>[[Water_shortages_and_droughts_impact_on_semiconductor_manufacturing | Impact of Droughts]]</h5>
Taiwan has been suffering through one of its worst droughts in many years, affecting areas like Tainan, Gaochon, Taitung, and Shinchu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. TSMC has budgeted millions of dollars to truck water to its fabs in Tainan due to these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

The [[semiconductor_industry_water_usage | semiconductor industry's thirst]] will continue as [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Moore's Law]] pushes forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Ongoing advancements in water recycling, reduction techniques, and reuse technologies are crucial to prevent a future where water supply cannot meet demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

For decades, [[Kodak and Fujifilm rivalry | Eastman Kodak]] and Fujifilm dominated the silver-based photographic film industry, clashing for market dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. However, these markets suddenly began to collapse with the rapid arrival of digital photography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Fujifilm, despite being hit hard, transformed into a larger company after this transition, while Kodak did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Advent of Digital Photography

For a long time, [[Traditional vs digital cameras | digital photography]] was considered thirty years away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Both Kodak and Fujifilm had long recognized that [[Traditional vs digital cameras | digital imaging]] was the future and developed many [[Traditional vs digital cameras | digital imaging]] technologies themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Early Developments
In 1975, Kodak employee Steve Sasson created the first digital camera, weighing eight pounds and resembling a toaster, though its imagery was not good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Kodak employees predicted that silver-based imaging would be obsolete by the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Kodak scientists also produced high-quality image sensors, including a 1.4 million pixel CCD sensor in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. However, this laboratory product did not gain market traction due to high prices and a lack of proper peripherals like PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### The Commercial Breakthrough
In 1995, Casio released the QV-10, the first commercially successful consumer digital camera, priced at $833 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. While its image quality was inferior to film and battery life was poor, it featured a 1.8-inch color LCD screen, allowing users to view pictures immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Other electronics companies like Sony followed, but CCD-based digital cameras initially struggled due to subpar image quality, slow shutter speeds, poor battery life, and high costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

Film and camera sales peaked in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. However, by 2001, global demand for color film began to decline rapidly at 20-30% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This shift was largely due to the widespread proliferation of the CMOS image sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Unlike specialty CCD chips, CMOS image sensors could be produced in large quantities at low prices using standard silicon semiconductor fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. By the mid-1990s, process nodes were sophisticated enough to produce higher quality active pixel CMOS image sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. The final piece of the puzzle came in 1999 when [[Smartphone camera advancements | mobile phones]] started including these sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. CMOS image sensors became the fastest-ramping semiconductor product in history, marking the beginning of the end for silver-based film cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

## Kodak's Response: A Case of Failure to Adapt

[[Kodaks failure to adapt | Kodak's failure to adapt]] in the [[Traditional vs digital cameras | digital photography]] age has been studied by business schools for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
Kodak's explorations into [[Traditional vs digital cameras | digital photography]] often resulted only in patents, never successful new businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. The company hesitated to pursue ventures that didn't align with its core business, which was seen as one of the greatest business models ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Kodak struggled to settle on a plan for the [[Traditional vs digital cameras | digital era]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

### Strategic Missteps
While Kodak did shrink its film manufacturing business in 1999, cutting $1.2 billion in costs and 20,000 jobs, it never moved beyond the idea of selling film and providing photography services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Former CEO Colby Chandler attempted diversification into floppy disks, batteries, artificial snow, and pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. However, his successors, Kay Whitmore and George Fisher, reversed this strategy, doubling down on imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

In 1993, Kodak spun off its specialty chemical business, which generated eight percent of its sales from Kodak itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. Today, Eastman Chemical is a $10 billion Fortune 500 company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. Kodak also sold its Sterling Winthrop drug unit, which included Bayer Aspirin and generated over $1 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. Despite researching pharmaceutical and medical equipment patents similar to Fujifilm, Kodak withdrew from these areas in 1996 to focus solely on photography, branding itself an "Imaging company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

### Digital Efforts and Decline
Kodak released the EasyShare digital camera in 2001, which sold well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. Between 2004 and 2005, Kodak even held a leading market share in the U.S. [[Traditional vs digital cameras | digital camera]] market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. However, like Fujifilm, they quickly learned that digital cameras were a poor business model, as other companies flooded the market, eroding their share to seven percent by 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. Kodak then earned more from licensing its digital technology patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

In 2005, Kodak ventured into the inkjet printer business, a move likely influenced by new CEO Antonio Perez, who came from HP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. This foray resulted in significant net losses: $1.2 billion in 2005 and $691 million in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. By 2007, Kodak sold its last valuable asset, its healthcare division, which included radiology and medical printing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Saddled with high debt and pension liabilities, Kodak filed for bankruptcy five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.

From 2005 to 2010, Kodak's sales declined from $11 billion to $5.9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

## Fujifilm's Response: Diversification and Survival

Fujifilm's diversified business provided early warnings about the impending shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The company released a new product for diagnostic X-ray imaging in 1981, replacing X-ray film with a photosensitive plate, leading to the Fuji Computed Radiography product in 1983, which is still in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. The digitization of plate making for publications also made a computer-outputted single piece of film possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Shigataka Komori, a sales manager in that division, began to worry about a future where film was no longer needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

### The "Vision 75" Strategy
Recognizing the challenge, Fujifilm appointed Minoru Onishi as president in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. He introduced a three-pronged strategy called "Vision 75" in 2004, named for the company's 75th anniversary in 2010, aiming to guide the company beyond its roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>:

1.  **Produce Original Digital Imaging Technologies**: Fujifilm sought to be a pioneer in [[Traditional vs digital cameras | digital imaging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. They developed their own imaging sensors and released their first [[Traditional vs digital cameras | digital camera]], the Fujifilm DS-1P, in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
2.  **Milk the Analog Cash Cow**: By improving the quality of film images, Fujifilm aimed to prolong the life of its analog business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
3.  **Build New Business Lines**: The company needed to expand beyond [[Traditional vs digital cameras | digital photography]] and analog photographic film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

Despite its core business thriving in the 1980s, surpassing Kodak in technology and releasing popular products like the profitable 1986 QuickSnap disposable camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>, Fujifilm continued to diversify. Film sales were high, with operating profits over $600 million USD in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### Strategic Reforms and Diversification
Beginning in 2006, Fujifilm spent $1.8 billion on strategic reforms, cutting 15,000 jobs, closing factories, and canceling sales partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. While competitor Konica exited the photography business entirely, CEO Shigataka Komori never considered leaving, believing in the mission to "preserve and sustain the culture of Photography" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Fujifilm still produces film today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

Recognizing that [[Traditional vs digital cameras | digital cameras]] would not replace the profitability of film (which once accounted for 60% of sales and two-thirds of profits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, Fujifilm transitioned to entirely new markets, often leveraging technologies from its film business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

After a year of reviewing its lab technologies, Fujifilm identified six priority businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>:

*   **Digital Imaging**: Focusing on high-end [[Traditional vs digital cameras | digital cameras]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
*   **Optical Devices (Fujinon)**: Producing lenses for broadcast television and security cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   **Specialty Chemicals/Materials**: Building on the success of Fujitec (used in LCDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. These lines now serve the solar panel, touch panel, and semiconductor industries, even producing [[Challenges and advancements in photomask manufacturing | photo resists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
*   **Graphics**: Items for [[Traditional vs digital cameras | digital printing]] and in-house inkjet technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Documents**: Printers and office copier solutions, primarily through its Fuji Xerox joint venture, which became the company's largest business line in 2021, accounting for 30% of total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Starting in 1996, Fujifilm significantly increased patent applications for pharmaceutical products and medical care equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. They produced skincare cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements, leveraging expertise from film production in emulsions, oxidation, and collagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. This R&D surge was augmented by acquisitions, including Toyama Chemical in 2008 for nearly $1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

By its 2008 fiscal year, Fujifilm reported its highest sales in history, $27 billion USD, a 100% increase from 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. Imaging products, which were 54% of revenues, dropped to just 19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. Despite a hit from the 2008 financial crisis, Fujifilm's sales grew nearly 50% from 2005 to 2010, a stark contrast to Kodak's decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.

## Conclusion

The core difference between the two companies was their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. Kodak was a consumer brand with a strong technology base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. Fujifilm, however, began as a technology company that happened to sell to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. When consumer businesses vanished, Fujifilm found it easier to revert to its technological roots and diversify, leveraging its expertise in chemistry and precision chemicals to move into new businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

Kodak, however, could not make this shift, remaining stuck on a "sinking ship" by focusing on an outdated business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. The company name "Fujifilm" still retains "film," symbolizing its initial technological expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

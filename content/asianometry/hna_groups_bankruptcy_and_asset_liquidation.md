[[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group's]] rapid global expansion, which saw it preside over an estimated $170 billion in assets at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, came to a crashing halt in May 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The conglomerate, known for its extensive [[hna_groups_acquisition_strategy_and_its_consequences | acquisition strategy]] and opaque financial structures, eventually entered bankruptcy proceedings in February 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>, acknowledging $170 billion of debts from creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a>.

## The Debt-Fueled Expansion and Warning Signs

HNA's ambition was codified in its "Super X plan," aiming to accumulate 1 trillion RMB of assets in just five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. From late 2010 to 2017, HNA spent billions acquiring hotels, tech companies, real estate, and airports, with a peak from 2015 to 2017 where $50 billion was spent on 123 acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

The vast majority of the money for these purchases was borrowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. HNA shifted from mortgaging plane assets to mortgaging land development projects and other hard assets across China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. They partnered with indebted provincial governments for investment projects, leasing assets to them to help duck debt limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. These land development projects were then spun off into publicly traded subsidiaries, whose skyrocketing stock prices allowed HNA's management to pledge shares for even more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. This complex capital structure, involving a web of China-based investment entities, including 10 on Shenzhen/Shanghai markets and 7 on Hong Kong markets, allowed HNA to re-mortgage acquired companies for additional funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

The company's reliance on continuous borrowing to pay back previous loans was a perilous way to scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## The Turning Point: Regulatory Scrutiny and Financial Woes

In mid-May 2017, HNA issued $500 million in bonds for its 245 Park Avenue purchase in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>, which would be one of its last overseas M&A financing transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

The situation drastically changed on June 22, 2017, when the China Banking Regulatory Commission ordered several banks to conduct risk checks on the overseas borrowing and investing by HNA and other conglomerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

Following this, major banks began to withdraw support:
*   **July 2017** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>: HNA subsidiary Sherco canceled its purchase of a 34.9% stake in Global Eagle Entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Bank of America stopped accepting HNA Group company shares as pledges for new loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>.
*   **September 2017** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>: Goldman Sachs followed suit, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority requested information from HNA about its financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   **November 2017** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>: HNA issued $300 million of 363-day dollar bonds at an extremely high interest rate of 8.875% â€“ China's highest ever for its class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>. Yields on HNA debt began to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.
*   **Late November 2017** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>: The Chinese central government criticized HNA's Sanya new airport reclamation project for "suspected illegal use of the sea," which shook confidence in the company's vaunted [[impact_of_government_relationships_on_hna_group | government connections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. HNA then reported its core financial data, revealing an estimated current loan balance of 637 billion RMB ($94 billion USD), a 36% increase from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. Including unlisted subsidiaries, estimates went as high as 1 trillion RMB ($148 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>, making HNA Group Asia's most indebted company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. Credit rating agencies promptly downgraded the company's debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

## Asset Liquidation and Bankruptcy Proceedings

In January 2018, HNA management met with creditors and announced plans to unwind its build-up and return to its core airline business, aiming to sell 100 billion RMB of assets in the first half of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. A third of HNA's publicly traded affiliates had their share trading suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>, including:
*   HNA Tourism Service business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>
*   Bohai Leasing (once the third largest in the world) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>
*   Tianjin Tianhai (which owned Ingram Micro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>
*   Hainan Airlines Holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>
*   C.COOP Group (retail chain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>

HNA had pledged up to 60% of the total shares in circulation for loans for some of these companies, a key source of cash for the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

Throughout 2018, HNA began selling off assets acquired just a year earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>:
*   Two plots from the Kai Tak airport site in Hong Kong were sold to Henderson Land for $2 billion, a rare recorded gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:37">[00:28:37]</a>.
*   A portion of its stake in Deutsche Bank was sold off, a process that continues today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
*   Swissport was swapped to its senior creditors in August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
*   The massive Ingram Micro IT subsidiary was sold to Platinum Equity in December 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.

The rapid sell-down occurred amid personal tragedy, including the death of co-founder Wang Jian in July 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.

Despite the asset sales, the devastating impact of COVID-19 on HNA's core airline and travel businesses sparked a final crisis it could not overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. On February 2021, HNA finally entered bankruptcy proceedings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>. The company is likely to be split into four businesses after bankruptcy procedures are complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. Co-founder Tan Xiang and Chief Executive Adam Tan were detained by the Chinese government in September 2021 for suspected crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.

The entire enterprise, built on mountains of [[financial_challenges_and_debt_management_at_hna_group | debt]] and the unspoken implication of close [[impact_of_government_relationships_on_hna_group | government involvement]], eventually collapsed when it could no longer dodge oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

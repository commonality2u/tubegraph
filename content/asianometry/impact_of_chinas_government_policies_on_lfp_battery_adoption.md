Lithium-ion battery pack prices saw a significant reduction of 20% in 2024, reaching $115 per kilowatt-hour, marking the largest price cut since 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This trend has made Chinese batteries more economical, even with tariffs of 25%, 35%, or potentially 120% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. At the heart of this shift are price and [[technological_innovations_in_lfp_battery_production | technology developments]] in Lithium Ion Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

Once viewed as cheap and low-end with fundamental chemistry weaknesses, LFP batteries have seen a resurgence largely due to China's engineering advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. LFP batteries offer significant [[advantages_and_disadvantages_of_lfp_batteries | cost advantages]] because they utilize common materials like iron and phosphorus instead of rarer, more expensive nickel and cobalt found in ternary batteries (NMC, NCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. They also retain their initial energy capacity better over many cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a> and have lower thermal risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. However, their primary drawback has been lower energy densities compared to ternary chemistries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Early Policy Influence

In the early stages of electric vehicle (EV) development in China, the government played a pivotal role in promoting LFP battery adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. China's initial EV makers, particularly for public service vehicles like buses, adopted LFPs under the influence of early industrial policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

One such policy was the "Thousands of Vehicles, Tens of Cities" (TVTC) program, launched in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. TVTC provided subsidies to municipal governments to purchase fleets of EVs, aiming to address urban air pollution, enhance energy security, and foster the growth of Chinese EV manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Companies like BYD were early adopters of LFPs, driven by cost and safety considerations, and became pioneers in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. For several years, LFP chemistries dominated the Chinese EV industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Policy Shift Favors Ternary Batteries

In late 2016, the Chinese government began altering its subsidy policies to incentivize the production of more consumer-attractive EVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. These new policies linked car subsidies to factors like higher energy density, longer driving ranges, faster charging rates, and fuel savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Vehicles with ranges below 150 kilometers no longer qualified for subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

This shift significantly favored cars equipped with ternary battery chemistries, which offered higher energy densities and thus longer ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. As a result, even long-time LFP proponents like BYD started incorporating ternary batteries into their models by 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. By mid-2019, ternary batteries reached approximately 70% of installed capacity, while LFP market share fell to 30% or lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Subsidy Withdrawal and LFP Revitalization

Two major developments reversed the decline of LFP batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>:

1.  **Withdrawal of Subsidies**: Starting in June 2019, the Chinese government announced the gradual withdrawal of EV cash subsidy policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. While expected due to the significant scale of subsidies and reports of "subsidy cheating," the aggressive schedule surprised the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The subsidy was immediately reduced by 50% in mid-2019, with further reductions planned for subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This aggressive sunsetting leveled the cost playing field, prompting EV makers to switch back to LFP batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
2.  **LFP Patent Expiration**: Crucial patents for LFP battery technology, including key innovations in carbon coating and process technologies that made LFP commercially viable, expired in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Previously, a deal in the 2000s or 2010s allowed Chinese battery makers to use these LFP patents for free, but only within their local markets, while others had to pay licensing fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This "patent shield" enabled China to develop extensive proficiency in LFP manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. By the time the patents expired, Chinese manufacturers had built immense LFP supply chain proficiency, including cell-to-pack innovations, massive economies of scale, materials sourcing, and talent pipelines, leaving foreign competitors significantly behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

## Catalyzing Innovation and Dominance

The market shifts and policy changes spurred significant [[technological_innovations_in_lfp_battery_production | technological innovations]] within the LFP sector. Companies like BYD introduced the Blade battery in March 2020, which utilizes a Cell-to-Pack (CTP) design to directly integrate cells into the battery pack, maximizing volume utilization and compensating for LFP's lower energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This innovation significantly increased LFP battery pack energy density, reaching about 85% of conventional NMC batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Other Chinese manufacturers like CATL quickly adopted similar CTP technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

By 2021, LFP battery volumes surpassed NMC, and by 2023, they accounted for nearly 70% of EV installations in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This dominance was further cemented by intense competition within the [[Impact of the Chinese EV Market on Nissan | Chinese EV market]], with new models constantly emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. This competitive pressure pushed LFP makers to develop new production methods, such as LMFP (Lithium Manganese Iron Phosphate) for higher energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, and the "double firing" process for improved consistency and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

The [[trends_in_global_battery_material_prices_and_their_effects_on_the_market | concurrent crash in raw material prices]] after 2022, especially for lithium and iron ore, further enabled Chinese EV battery makers to cut prices while maintaining profitability, despite intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

The success of LFP batteries, initially fostered by Chinese government policies and later by their strategic withdrawal and a unique patent landscape, has not only transformed the EV industry but also had spillover effects into other sectors like utility-scale Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

In 1989, Bulgaria achieved a remarkable feat by exporting more computers than all other Eastern Bloc countries combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It was also the sole COMECON country producing hard disk drive memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The electronics industry became a significant export force, employing over 11% of all Bulgarian workers in the production of computers and electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Bulgaria produced some of the world's first electronic calculators and personal computers, many of which became iconic brands in Southeastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This article explores the [[rise_and_fall_of_the_bulgarian_computer_industry | unlikely rise and fall of the Bulgarian computer industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Beginnings and Economic Context

Bulgaria, established as the Third Bulgarian State in 1878, began as a relatively poor, largely agricultural economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. After World War II, when Bulgaria fought alongside the Axis powers, the Soviet Union marched into the country, leading to the overthrow of the czarist government and the establishment of the People's Republic of Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The Bulgarian Communist Party then rebuilt the nation, modeling its economic policies after the Soviet Union, which provided loans, raw materials, and purchased Bulgarian finished goods at generous terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## [[impact_of_todor_zhivkovs_leadership_on_bulgarias_economy | Todor Zhivkov's Leadership]] and Vision

Following Stalin's death in 1953, [[impact_of_todor_zhivkovs_leadership_on_bulgarias_economy | Todor Zhivkov]] assumed leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party in 1953, ruling for 35 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. His moderate rule provided unprecedented political and economic stability until 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Zhivkov's economic policy focused on producing machinery and tools for heavy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. He greatly admired the Japanese economy and sought to emulate its development path, particularly in heavy industry and electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Zhivkov considered electronics his "weakness," seeing it as Bulgaria's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## The Bulgarian Computer Gap

In the 1950s, Bulgarian scientists began studying Soviet cybernetics and the economic potential of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. While other countries like the Soviet Union (MESM computer, 1951), East Germany (ZRA-1, 1956), Czechoslovakia, Romania (1957), Hungary (1958), and Poland (1959) were building their first-generation computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, Bulgaria lagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Catch-up efforts were hindered by Western export restrictions imposed by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), which prevented Bulgaria and other Soviet allies from acquiring high-technology tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Computing Center and Vitosha

In 1956, Professor Ljubomir Iliev attended a Moscow conference that recommended all socialist countries establish their own computing centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This led to the approval and creation of a new computing center within the Mathematical Institute of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences in 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

In 1962, Professor Iliev's team began work on the Vitosha, Bulgaria's first digital computer, completed in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Modeled after one of Romania's CIFA computers, Vitosha was a large machine with 1,500 vacuum tubes and a magnetic drum memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. It could perform 2,000 operations per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Vitosha was demonstrated at the "Bulgaria Builds Socialism" exhibition in Moscow, where it impressed observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. However, after its return to Bulgaria, a burst hot water pipe damaged the computer beyond repair, and it was dismantled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## The Rise of ELKA and DSO IZOT

Despite Vitosha's demise, its success at the Moscow exhibition generated political support for further computer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. In 1964, Professor Ivan Popov, chairman of Bulgaria's State Committee for Science and Technical Progress (DKNTP) and considered the founder of Bulgaria's computer industry, championed the push into electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Popov was a patriotic entrepreneur who believed in a modern, technology-driven economy for Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Popov challenged Iliev's team to reverse-engineer the Sumlock ANITA, the world's first all-electronic calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Unable to source the ANITA's Dekatron tubes within the Soviet Bloc, the team brilliantly re-engineered the design to use transistors instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This led to the creation of the ELKA (short for "electronic calculator") 6521 in 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The ELKA 6521 was one of the first transistorized, all-electronic desktop calculators, comparable to Western models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

Popov aggressively marketed ELKA calculators to the Soviet Gosplan, bluffing about large-scale factory readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. While the initial ELKA-6521 didn't sell to the Soviets, a simplified and cheaper model, the ELKA-22, and the ELKA-25 (with a printer, possibly the first of its kind) secured a deal with Gosplan in 1966 after Popov cut the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This success led to the establishment of DSO IZOT in 1967, an industrial conglomerate for calculating machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. From 1967 to 1984, IZOT generated over 11 billion leva in export revenues, sending products to the Soviet Union, Switzerland, and Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The ELKA-42, an integrated circuit (IC) based calculator, was showcased at the Osaka World Expo in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. ELKA also diversified into IC-powered cash registers, exporting thousands to Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### [[bulgarias_semiconductor_and_electronics_industry_development | Bulgarian Semiconductors]]

A key factor in Bulgaria's rapid advancement was its developing [[bulgarias_semiconductor_and_electronics_industry_development | semiconductor capacity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. In parallel with IZOT's founding, the Institute of Microelectronics was established, with a design house in Sofia and a production fab in Botevgrad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Led by pioneer physicist Yordan Kasabov, who produced Bulgaria's first domestic MOS transistors, the Institute rapidly advanced the country's semiconductor capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Kasabov designed and manufactured the ICs for the ELKA-42 using modern processes like photolithography and ion implantation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

Around 1972-1973, Kasabov and Lubomir Antonov visited Silicon Valley, observing the rapid growth of the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Inspired by a 4-bit IC from AMD, they aimed to create similar components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Upon their return, they produced microprocessors like the CM-400, enabling advanced calculators like the ELKA-50 series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

## [[role_of_comecon_and_soviet_influence_on_bulgaria | Unified System of Computers]] and Monopoly

In 1969, the Soviet Bloc decided to produce a [[soviet_computer_development_history | Unified System of Computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Concerned about the slow pace of the [[role_of_comecon_and_soviet_influence_on_bulgaria | COMECON]], Ivan Popov helped establish the Intergovernmental Commission on Computing Technology (IGCCT) to move faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. As a founder, Popov ensured Bulgaria played a crucial role, being assigned only three of the 105 items but producing the most valuable ones: memory disks, magnetic memory tapes, and a processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

To achieve this, Popov arranged technology transfer agreements with Western companies (e.g., Fujitsu for memory tape design) and copied others (e.g., IBM disk drives) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. He coordinated the simultaneous construction of seven new plants for these components, pushing teams hard to meet deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Bulgaria secured a monopoly on products like hard disk drives within the Eastern Bloc, selling them at high prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. These high-quality, large-scale exports, combined with a profitable Soviet oil re-export deal, buoyed the Bulgarian economy throughout the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

### Popov's Exit

Ivan Popov's blunt nature and political skills eventually led to his downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. In 1974, his proposal to build mainframes in direct competition with the Soviet Union and East Germany met strong resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. When Popov refused to compromise, [[impact_of_todor_zhivkovs_leadership_on_bulgarias_economy | Todor Zhivkov]] removed him from the Politburo and sent him to Switzerland as an ambassador <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Despite this, IZOT later ventured into supercomputers, with Bulgarian machines like the IZOT-1014 powering geological centers in the Soviet Union and being exported to countries like India by 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

## Microcomputers and Pravetz

Bulgaria was an early adopter in the personal computing boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. In 1979, Ivan Marangozov led a team that successfully cloned an imported Apple II computer, creating the IMKO-1 ("Individual Micro Computer") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. This clone was nearly identical, with a Cyrillic keyboard and reliance on tape cassette memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. Although produced in limited numbers (at least 50), the IMKO-1 was popular and functional, demonstrating control over a robot arm at an exhibition in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

The team then developed the IMKO-2, a mass-production version modeled after the cheaper Apple IIe PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Production moved to a new factory in Pravetz, Zhivkov's hometown, leading to the commercial name Pravetz-82, starting in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. While still expensive for the average Bulgarian, Pravetz PCs became reasonably accessible and popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. Production scaled from 500 units in 1983 to 18,000 two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Many Bulgarians learned programming on Pravetz PCs, and by 1987, there were over 500 computer clubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. The Pravetz factory produced around 60,000 computers annually at its peak, exported to the Soviet Union, other COMECON countries, and some Western nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## Missed Opportunity and Decline

By the late 1970s, Bulgaria was among the top 10 electronics manufacturing countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. However, the government stopped investing in microelectronics, possibly due to military and heavy industry priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This stalled Bulgaria's [[bulgarias_semiconductor_and_electronics_industry_development | semiconductor industry]], hindering its competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. For example, the Institute of Microelectronics developed an IC for pocket calculators that the fab couldn't produce, forcing IZOT to import foreign chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. Imported chips required precious foreign currency, making Bulgarian products more expensive than Japanese and Western counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

A significant setback occurred when a technology collaboration deal with American company Rockwell was inexplicably blocked by Bulgarian State Security, reportedly due to Soviet Union authorities fearing Bulgaria getting too close to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. This prevented the future of the [[bulgarias_semiconductor_and_electronics_industry_development | Bulgarian semiconductor industry]] from advancing, necessitating imported chips for more sophisticated computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

By 1988, the Bulgarian computer industry employed over 169,000 people, about 12% of the labor force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. However, times were changing. In November 1989, [[impact_of_todor_zhivkovs_leadership_on_bulgarias_economy | Todor Zhivkov]] resigned after losing support amid opposition and a botched assimilation drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. In 1990, the industry still employed 181,000 people, but the collapse of the Soviet Union starting in 1991 proved devastating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. Ninety-five percent of Bulgaria's electronics revenue came from within the Soviet Bloc, with the USSR being the largest market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. As products were often based on stolen Western designs, the loss of Soviet customers left nowhere else to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. Dependence on expensive Western-sourced components (30-40% of a computer) became prohibitively expensive as Bulgaria's currency weakened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

The opening of Bulgaria's markets in the early 1990s brought in extremely cheap South Korean and Taiwanese PCs, leading to a rapid decline in demand for Pravetz PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. The factories closed in 1994, and the once-formidable [[rise_and_fall_of_the_bulgarian_computer_industry | Bulgarian computer industry collapsed]], with employment crashing from nearly 200,000 to just 30,000 within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

## Conclusion

Bulgaria's link to the Soviet Union was a double-edged sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. The Soviets were their largest customer, and Bulgaria's monopoly on valuable computer parts was a significant economic advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. However, this link also became a massive handicap. It necessitated copying Western technology, which restricted exports, and prevented closer ties with the West, thereby capping technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. [[impact_of_todor_zhivkovs_leadership_on_bulgarias_economy | Zhivkov's]] vision of transforming Bulgaria into another Japan was tantalizingly close, but ultimately unfulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.

The financial sustainability of the current surge in AI investments is a significant question, with attention on the sheer scale of proposed ventures, the underlying technical "scaling laws" driving demand, the competitive landscape of [[Nvidia and competition in the AI chip market | AI chip]] development, and the eventual market for AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:09">[09:09:09]</a>. This article draws insights from a learning tour through Japan and the United States aimed at understanding the [[the_ai_and_ai_chip_boom_landscape | AI and AI chip boom landscape]] outside of Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## The Trillion-Dollar Question

Considerable news has surrounded a chip venture involving [[sam_altmans_ai_chip_venture | Sam Altman]] of OpenAI for the AI industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Initially reported as "billions" raised from Middle East investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, subsequent reports indicated talks with TSMC, parties in Abu Dhabi, and the US Government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The Wall Street Journal later reported figures ranging from $1-7 trillion, sparking widespread discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Many view this figure as exceptionally high, possibly a negotiating tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The Information clarified that [[sam_altmans_ai_chip_venture | Altman]] privately stated this figure represents the total investments participants would need across the entire ecosystem, including real estate, power for data centers, and chip manufacturing, over several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

> But in reality, Altman privately has told people that figure represents the sum total of investments that participants ... would need to make, in everything from real estate and power for data centers to the manufacturing of the chips, over some period of years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

This "ecosystem concept" provides more context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. In comparison, total semiconductor sales in 2023 were around $520 billion, with capital expenditures at about $140 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Even when spread over five years and diluted with real estate and power costs, a trillion-dollar investment signifies a "COVID-like step function upwards in capital expenditure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The semiconductor industry, known for its conservative nature and experience with market cycles, tends to be cautious about new entrants claiming to "change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Scaling Laws and Investment Drivers

The significant investment in AI is largely driven by the concept of "scaling laws," articulated in a 2020 OpenAI paper, which suggests that combining more data and compute leads to better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This idea was central to the development of OpenAI's GPT-series models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Ilya Sutskever, an OpenAI co-founder, noted that previous neural networks were too small to be effective, and larger networks enable "unprecedented" capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. As GPT models grow in size (GPT-3, GPT-4, and forthcoming GPT-5), their performance continues to improve, with no current signs that scaling laws are breaking down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

The parallels between scaling laws in AI and Moore's Law in semiconductors are notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Moore's Law served as a rallying cry for the semiconductor industry for decades, driving R&D roadmaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Similarly, scaling laws could significantly impact the AI industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. While challenges exist, such as the perceived depletion of internet data, historical precedents from Moore's Law suggest that engineering solutions often emerge when money is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The key question remains: is the money available to sustain this investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>?

## [[Nvidia and competition in the AI chip market | AI Chips]] and Vertical Integration

The pursuit of profits in the [[AI accelerators market growth | AI accelerators market]] has drawn many competitors to [[Nvidia and competition in the AI chip market | Nvidia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. However, [[Nvidia and competition in the AI chip market | Nvidia's]] strategy of aggressively ramping up annual updates to its accelerator lineup, reminiscent of its rapid product releases during the Graphics Cards Wars, makes its position formidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This speed is enabled by their practice of shipping before extensive physical testing, relying on advanced computer software design and emulation tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. While this can lead to initial software issues for customers, [[Nvidia and competition in the AI chip market | Nvidia's]] brand can absorb such hits, unlike smaller AI chip startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

More significant to [[Nvidia and competition in the AI chip market | Nvidia]] than startups are the tech giants (e.g., Microsoft, Google), who are driving current AI investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. These companies have a strong incentive to cut [[Nvidia and competition in the AI chip market | Nvidia]] out of their margins by developing custom-designed chips or [[AI accelerators market growth | ASICs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Examples include Google's TPU, now in its fourth iteration, which contributes to Google's compute advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Microsoft, in particular, is aggressively pursuing vertical integration, as evidenced by CEO Satya Nadella's comments on inference dominating Azure AI services usage, which is more amenable to custom [[AI accelerators market growth | ASICs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Microsoft is also developing custom network cards to shuttle data between servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This trend suggests either that the scale of AI data infrastructure is so vast that every cost saving counts, or that industry growth might slow, leading to price competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. While tech giants' custom chips will take time to mature, this trend implies [[Nvidia and competition in the AI chip market | Nvidia]] must continually strive to win the performance-cost battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## The "Real" Question of Consumer Demand

A critical question is whether the current AI boom is "Real" (with a capital R) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Despite impressive technological advancements, like OpenAI's Sora text-to-video model, the core question is whether these technologies are embedded in "compelling products" that consumers are willing to pay for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

Historically, massive investments driven by Moore's Law and the semiconductor industry were fueled by real demand from downstream sectors: military, consumer electronics (radios, calculators), PCs, smartphones, and cloud computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. These were products ordinary people wanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The truly large AI investments may not materialize unless ordinary consumers start buying AI services in a significant way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

Some early indicators exist:
*   ChatGPT achieved a $2 billion run-rate revenue in December 2023, signaling that people are paying for an LLM service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   ChatGPT is one of the fastest-growing consumer tech products in history, and [[sam_altmans_ai_chip_venture | Altman]] reported it generates 100 billion words daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

However, a comparison to the iPhone's rapid consumer adoption is illustrative: the iPhone, released in June 2007, sold 20 million units by 2009, generating $13 billion in revenue, with sales continuing to grow significantly in subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. While ChatGPT is fast-growing, AI products also have high operational costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

Microsoft Copilot, a $20-a-month subscription service, is another product closely watched by the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Its success in gaining traction with consumers and enterprises will be a key determinant of the market's trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## AI as an Enabling Technology

One perspective is that the "real" AI revolution will occur when it is embedded into existing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. For example, AI automation could significantly boost advertising sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>:
*   Google's Performance Max ads use AI to automate ad creation, deployment, and targeting, reportedly generating tens of billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   After Apple disabled cookie tracking in 2021, Meta (Facebook) initially projected over $10 billion in lost sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. However, Meta managed to restore targeting accuracy using AI and data from its Conversions API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

This suggests that a "killer app" for AI might simply be "more ads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Experts like Ben Thompson propose that AI is primarily an "enabling technology," making the already rich richer rather than creating entirely new classes of wealthy individuals, unlike the PC or electrification eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. While this outcome might be "a bit disappointing," it still renders the AI boom "nevertheless real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

Japan experienced a digital trade deficit of approximately 5.5 trillion yen ($37 billion) in 2023, double the amount from 2015, indicating a significant import of software licenses, cloud, and other services over exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Despite iconic hardware companies like Sony, Fujitsu, and Hitachi, Japan lacks global software giants comparable to Microsoft or Oracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This imbalance stems from historical challenges in its software industry, particularly concerning talent development and the emergence of startups.

## The Good Programmer Shortage

Japan faced a serious "software crisis" due to a persistent shortage of qualified and productive software programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. This shortage was exacerbated by several factors:

*   **Educational Lag** Japanese universities did not have enough qualified teachers in computer science and software, with most professors trained in other disciplines like math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. These educators also lagged in adopting the latest computing trends for their curriculums, partly due to a lack of English bilingual abilities and overseas experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.
*   **Unattractive Career Prospects** Software engineering was not considered an attractive job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. The largest employers of software developers were the software development arms of larger business families, operating on a lifetime employment system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. In these roles, developers were not customer-facing and lacked clear career progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. The work itself often involved "boring customization or maintenance code-monkeying" and did not pay well or feel fulfilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. In 2010, an estimate suggested that 80% of Japan's software expenditure went towards maintaining existing systems, compared to no more than 60% in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.

## Lack of Software Startups

Startups are crucial for promoting the appeal of programming and serving as centers of technological dynamism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. However, independent software companies failed to emerge significantly in 1980s Japan, unlike in the United States where companies like Adobe, Intuit, Microsoft, and Oracle were founded or gained prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

Reasons for this lack of startup emergence included:
*   Insufficient customer acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>
*   Lack of venture capital investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>
*   An unwieldy lifetime employment system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>
*   A cultural lack of initiative and risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>

Japan's historical focus on hardware and [[mitis_role_in_japans_computer_and_software_industry_development | MITI]]'s playbook of reverse-engineering popular products for cheaper mass production, which worked for industrial items like steel and automobiles, proved ill-suited for software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. Software success depends on widely held standards, networks of applications or users, and consumer familiarity, rather than just "replication economics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>.

The [[impact_of_ibm_unbundling_on_japanese_software_industry | IBM unbundling]] in 1969, while creating the software industry in the US, led Japanese computer-makers to establish software subsidiaries that "adopted" IBM's specifications via reverse-engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. This practice, often illegal, meant Japanese software was heavily customized for Japanese Kanji symbols and specific business practices, locking in customers but limiting broader sales potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

## Current State

Despite these historical challenges, Japan does possess a large software industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:00">[18:36:00]</a>. However, its landscape remains dominated by custom-made packages with limited broader sales potential or imported products developed abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>. While there are signs that issues on the talent side are clearing up, with Japanese software programmers being quite skilled even without American-scale salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>, and notable achievements like the Ruby language originating from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>, [[japans_digital_trade_deficit_in_software | Japan's digital trade deficit in software]] persists, and coherent policy solutions remain elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>.

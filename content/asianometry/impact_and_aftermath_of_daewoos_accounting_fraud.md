The [[rise_and_fall_of_daewoo_group | collapse of Daewoo Group]] in the late 1990s was significantly exacerbated by widespread accounting fraud, which concealed the true extent of its financial distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Unveiling the Fraud

By the end of 1998, despite management's claims of a profit loss due to "unique one-off situations," Daewoo was already a bankrupt entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The reported profits from core companies were generated through a scheme of fictitious overseas asset sales between sister subsidiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

This scheme involved one subsidiary selling an asset, like a tractor, to another subsidiary at an inflated price that no one else would pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. The purchasing subsidiary would pay with stock or another asset, allowing the selling subsidiary to record a false profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. This artificial sale also enabled the revaluation of all other similar assets at the new, inflated price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

If these asset swaps and other fraudulent practices were removed, Daewoo's reported loss of half a trillion Korean won in 1998 would have actually been eight times that amount, or four trillion won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. Some estimates suggest the total fraud in 1997 and 1998 could have been as high as 23 trillion won, approximately $19 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. This made it Korea's largest accounting fraud up to that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>.

Regardless of the exact scale, the fraud confirmed that Daewoo was insolvent, a "dead man walking" with far more liabilities than assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

## Immediate Consequences

As the true financial state became clear and negotiations with the government for a bailout failed due to Daewoo's resistance to austerity measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, the government limited financial institutions' exposure to Daewoo debt, effectively cutting off its credit lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

Chairman Kim Woo-Choong, who remained an "empire builder" unable to accept shrinkage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>, made a final gambit in July 1999, publicly offering his personal wealth as collateral and proposing to resign all but his Daewoo Motors position if creditors injected another 4 trillion won ($3.4 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. This attempt failed.

In August 1999, Kim was removed from his companies, and the subsidiaries were placed into bankruptcy to be sold off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. At its collapse, Daewoo owed over $50 billion in [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]] to 140 banks in over 100 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

Kim fled the country in November 1999, living in exile for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. Upon his return, he was put on trial, received a large fine, and a ten-year prison sentence, though he was pardoned less than a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. He died in 2019 at the age of 82 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

## Broader Aftermath and Reforms

The financial fallout from Daewoo's collapse was immense:
*   **Financial Institutions**: Banks and insurance companies lost trillions of won due to Daewoo's debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.
*   **Government Intervention**: The Korean government was forced to inject public money to prevent these banks from collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Changes**: The crisis led to extensive reforms, increasing investor transparency and banking oversight in South Korea, demonstrating the [[impact_of_financial_crisess_on_south_korean_business_practices | impact of financial crises]] on business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.
*   **Accounting Industry**: Accountants, despite the size of the fraud, failed to sound the alarms, likely due to the power of their clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. Several accountants faced fines and license suspensions, prompting reforms in the Korean accounting industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.
*   **Missing Funds**: While the fraud was extensively documented, between $750 million and $4 billion remains unaccounted for from Daewoo's coffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. Some of this money may have been used for personal expenses, such as a $2.5 million donation to Harvard for Kim's son, or paid to the government as bribes, highlighting aspects of the [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | history of corruption and crony capitalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

Today, the companies that once formed Daewoo Group operate independently, though some may still bear the Daewoo name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

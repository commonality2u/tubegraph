5G represents the latest transition in wireless technology, promising immense bandwidth and super-fast speeds, particularly through [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | Millimeter-Wave]] technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While fascinating, [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | Millimeter-Wave]] has faced difficult [[technical_and_economic_obstacles_in_mmwave_deployment | technical and economic challenges]] a few years into its rollout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. [[radio_frequency_integrated_circuits_and_their_role_in_5G | Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFICs)]] are central to this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Beginnings
A fundamental concept in wireless technology is the relationship between wavelength (distance a wave travels in a single cycle, measured in meters) and frequency (cycles passing a point, measured in hertz) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Frequency and wavelength are inversely related: as frequencies rise, wavelengths fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Countries allocate parts of their [[5g_spectrum_and_its_frequency_bands | spectrum]] for specific uses like radar, wireless, or WiFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The previous wireless generation, 4G, saw global telecoms converge on the LTE standard due to its superior data downlink speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. LTE had to accommodate many different frequency slices, ranging from 450 megahertz to 3.6 gigahertz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. A larger issue was the capacity constraints of using only small slices of frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Prior 1G through 4G systems used frequency bands below 7.125 gigahertz, which became very crowded over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Cell operators typically had only about 200 megahertz of [[5g_spectrum_and_its_frequency_bands | spectrum]] to work with, which was insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## 5G Philosophical Foundations and Use Cases
Engineers designed 5G with several core objectives beyond just handling more data traffic, primarily mobile video (Enhanced Mobile Broadband) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
Key envisioned communication types for 5G include:
*   **Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Networking (URLLC)**: For super important data that must be delivered quickly and reliably, such as self-driving cars communicating to avoid collisions or wirelessly controlled robot arms, requiring signal delivery in less than 10 milliseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Massive Machine Type Communications (mMTC)**: Meant for numerous low-cost machines that transmit data infrequently but for long periods, like sensors, actuators, and vending machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

These varied goals led to 5G being designed for greater flexibility, especially in the frequency bands it can use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This flexibility opened up new slices of the [[5g_spectrum_and_its_frequency_bands | spectrum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Millimeter Wave
In 2011, Zhouyue Pi and Farooq Khan from Samsung Electronics proposed exploring the largely unexplored [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] regions to overcome limited [[5g_spectrum_and_its_frequency_bands | spectrum]] issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. They pointed to several [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] bands in the 70/80/90 gigahertz range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. These are called [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | millimeter wave]] bands because their wavelengths are in the 1-10 millimeter range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The FCC opened them up in 2003 for new economic development, having previously been used for military radars, satellite communications, or cellular back-haul (point-to-point connections with fixed antennas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Beam tolerances in these older uses were so precise that strong winds could misalign them, explaining why [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] wasn't used for consumer wireless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

Initial consumer use cases for [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] after FCC approval included:
*   **Automotive radar**: Using the 77 gigahertz band to assist advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) in cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **WiGig WiFi standard**: Utilizing a 60 gigahertz band, though it hasn't widely caught on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

After Samsung's paper and subsequent research at NYU and UT Austin in 2014, it became technically feasible to bring [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] to consumer wireless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Ultimately, 5G gained support for bands from 24.25 to 52.6 gigahertz, in addition to traditional sub-7 gigahertz bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits (RFICs)
[[radio_frequency_integrated_circuits_and_their_role_in_5G | RFICs]] are critical for wireless devices, acting as transceivers (both transmitter and receiver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. When a phone sends a message, its processor sends digital bits to the [[radio_frequency_integrated_circuits_and_their_role_in_5G | RFIC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. The [[radio_frequency_integrated_circuits_and_their_role_in_5G | RFIC]] converts these digital bits into a continuous analog signal called the "baseband" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

#### Upconversion
The low-frequency baseband signal is not suitable for direct transmission because it would require an impractically large antenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The [[radio_frequency_integrated_circuits_and_their_role_in_5G | RFIC]] uses a mixer to combine the baseband signal with a higher "carrier frequency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This process, called "upconversion", transforms the baseband into a "passband" signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The cell operator selects the carrier frequency based on regulatory allotments and wireless technology standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The actual data from the baseband is encoded in "sidebands," which are frequencies higher and/or lower than the carrier frequency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The "bandwidth" is the entire slice of frequency from the lowest to highest sideband <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. A higher carrier frequency, like that of [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]], yields more bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

#### Path Loss and Attenuation
As a wave propagates outward from a mobile device, its power density dilutes, a phenomenon known as "path loss," measured by the Friis Equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Path loss contributes significantly to "attenuation," which is the gradual reduction of signal strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Other factors like rain, object obstruction, and even the human body also cause attenuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. To ensure the passband signal reaches the cell tower, its power must be amplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

#### Power Amplifier
The power amplifier is the most power-hungry and challenging module to design within an [[radio_frequency_integrated_circuits_and_their_role_in_5G | RFIC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Designers aim for high output power, good efficiency (measured by drain efficiency), and linearity (signal quality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. After amplification, the boosted passband signal is sent to the antennas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

#### Antennas for mmWave
While higher frequency waves (like [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]]) experience worse path loss with identically sized antennas, their smaller wavelengths allow for smaller antennas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This enables stuffing arrays of up to 32 antennas into the same space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. These antenna arrays can generate directional beams aimed at the tower or base station, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. When receiving, the handset reverses the process: isolating, amplifying, and then using a mixer to convert the analog signal back to digital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

### Line of Sight and Densification Challenges
A significant [[technical_and_economic_obstacles_in_mmwave_deployment | challenge]] with [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] is its inability to easily penetrate objects like buildings, foliage, and even the human body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Bricks, trees, and outdoor tinted glass are particularly effective at attenuating [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Even turning away from the base station can drastically reduce performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] works best in extremely busy areas with "line of sight," such as sports arenas, malls, and airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

This characteristic necessitates "densification" of cell sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Unlike 1G-4G, which used large macro-cells with several kilometers of range, [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] requires installing many small cells, possibly as close as 50-100 meters apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Acquiring these sites is challenging due to the need for 24/7 power, back-haul connections, aesthetic inconspicuousness, and environmental permitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Telecoms have considered leveraging reflectors integrated into billboards or exterior glass to bounce [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] signals, saving costs compared to acquiring new cell sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

## 5G Deployment Strategies
The transition from LTE to 5G has been complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. 5G is defined by any device using the 5G New Radio standard, which supports three sets of [[5g_spectrum_and_its_frequency_bands | 5G bands]]: low, mid, and high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **Low and mid bands** (between 410 megahertz and 7.1 gigahertz) offer good coverage but weaker capacity, similar to 4G LTE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   **High band** is where the [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave spectrum]] resides, promising the most capacity and data rates, but also requiring the most work due to propagation and densification [[technical_and_economic_obstacles_in_mmwave_deployment | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

Telecoms have two primary ways to deploy 5G without abandoning their expensive LTE networks:
1.  **Standalone (SA)**: Building and deploying a true 5G network with 5G base stations attached to a 5G core network, connected to 5G New Radio consumer devices. It is completely new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
2.  **Non-standalone (NSA)**: A middle-ground stepping stone where a 5G New Radio connects to a 4G LTE core network. This offers somewhat faster speeds and LTE fallback, but the improvement is not as significant, especially at lower bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

## United States Deployment Experience
American telecoms, particularly Verizon and AT&T, were among the first to pursue [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] 5G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. This made strategic sense because their existing 3G and 4G networks already occupied the low and mid-band [[5g_spectrum_and_its_frequency_bands | 5G frequencies]], making the high bands "green field territory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

In 2018, Verizon began deploying Non-Standalone 5G for mobile and fixed wireless access (internet broadband delivered wirelessly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. While fixed wireless access has worked well, the mobile service part of the [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] rollout faced issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. The smartphone ecosystem had matured, and customers were not willing to pay a significant premium for faster rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Confusing branding of what constituted "5G" also hindered adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

### Pullback from mmWave Focus
Despite Apple releasing the US version of the iPhone 12 with [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | 5G mmWave]] support in late 2020, market penetration did not significantly change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. Analysts expected [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] to carry about 5% of mobile traffic in 2021, and Verizon stated "over time, 50% of urban traffic will be on [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. However, in 2021, only about 2.9% of US urban mobile traffic was consumed on [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] 5G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Studies indicated that slight movements could cause phones to fall back to 4G LTE, making a large-city coverage strategy difficult to justify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

Verizon and Qualcomm argued that shifting data traffic to [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] would alleviate pressure on existing 3G and 4G networks, presenting a net positive for telecoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. Nevertheless, Wall Street was displeased, especially as T-Mobile deployed successful low and mid-band 5G networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

Consequently, Verizon and AT&T tweaked their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. In February 2021, they bought licenses for 5G mid-band [[5g_spectrum_and_its_frequency_bands | spectrum]] in the "C-band" (3.7 gigahertz), with Verizon spending over $45 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Since then, both companies have focused on expanding their mid-band offerings, including their Standalone 5G networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. Device support for [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] has also been inconsistent, with only US iPhones supporting it and iPads recently dropping support entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

## Conclusion
Telecoms continue to expand [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] deployment, primarily for fixed wireless access in rural areas and high-density urban areas like airports and sports stadiums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. These environments are where [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] performs best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. Many anticipated "internet of things" and industry 4.0 initiatives that 5G was expected to enable have not yet emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

In the United States, deployments have not met expectations, leading the FCC to explore creative solutions for the largely unused [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave spectrum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. Outside the US, global adoption of [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] has been limited, with Japan being a notable exception due to its network setup for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. While technology continues to evolve and telecoms move towards Standalone 5G, bolstered by advancements from companies like Qualcomm, the future benefit of [[millimeterwave_5g_challenges_and_prospects | mmWave]] from this progression remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

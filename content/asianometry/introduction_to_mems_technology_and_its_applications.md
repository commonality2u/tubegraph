Microelectromechanical Systems, or MEMS, are microsystems that possess both electric and mechanical functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. They are constructed using the same advanced techniques employed to create integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. MEMS are ubiquitous in daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Despite their miraculous technology, the industry has historically faced significant [[economic_challenges_in_the_mems_industry | economic issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## [[historical_development_of_mems | Historical Development]]

The aspiration to create incredibly small devices has a long history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. In 1959, Richard Feynman delivered a lecture at Caltech titled "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom," where he discussed the direct manipulation of atoms to build useful tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Feynman offered a $1,000 prize for a tiny motor, 0.4 millimeters per side, which was claimed less than a year later by a Caltech engineer using conventional tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

The true spirit of the challenge was met in 1967 when Harvey Nathanson at Westinghouse developed the resonant gate transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This gold transistor, about one millimeter long, was revolutionary because it could move, allowing researchers to control the distance between its gate and electrode using electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Its responsiveness to a narrow range of input signals made it useful as a frequency filter, marking it as the first real MEMS product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Early Major Applications

### Inkjet Nozzles
MEMS achieved widespread recognition in 1979 when Hewlett-Packard utilized [[impact_and_applications_of_silicon_wafers_in_technology | silicon]] micro-machining techniques to develop a printer inkjet nozzle for thermal inkjet technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. These nozzles became one of the technology's most successful applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Thermal inkjet technology functions by rapidly heating ink to approximately 100 degrees Celsius, forming tiny bubbles that push ink through a micro-machined nozzle onto paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The subsequent collapse of these bubbles creates a vacuum, drawing in more ink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. While the nozzles themselves are not mechanical, MEMS technology facilitated their creation, and their minuscule size allowed for high-resolution printing by integrating many nozzles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Sensors
In the 1990s, the MEMS industry found another significant commercial use in sensors for acceleration, pressure, and direction, applicable across industrial, medical, and electronics fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

#### Automotive Airbag Sensors
Initially, automotive airbag sensors were large, heavy, complex, and expensive mechanical devices, costing hundreds of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. In 1991, Analog Devices introduced the first commercial acceleration MEMS sensor, measuring less than one square centimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This sensor featured capacitive sense fingers attached to a mass that moves upon acceleration, changing its capacitive value, which is then sensed by a chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

Analog Devices integrated this accelerometer and its electronics onto a single [[impact_and_applications_of_silicon_wafers_in_technology | silicon]] chip, the ADXL50, capable of sensing accelerations up to 50 Gs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This monolithic system was smaller, more reliable, and significantly cheaper to produce ($5 compared to $20-100 for older systems), contributing to the widespread adoption of airbags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Modern cars now incorporate dozens of MEMS-based sensor devices for features like anti-lock brakes, active suspension, and rollover detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Over 60 million MEMS-based airbag sensors alone have been manufactured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

#### Medical Pressure Sensors
Pressure sensors became another significant application of MEMS technology, particularly for monitoring blood pressure in hospitals via intravenous lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Early external blood pressure sensors cost over $600 and required sterilization and recalibration for each reuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The MEMS version drastically reduced the cost to just $10, with most of the cost attributed to packaging, making it disposable and easier for medical use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

These sensors are mechanically simple: [[design_and_production_techniques_for_mems | silicon]] is crafted into a thin membrane (diaphragm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Four stress-sensitive polysilicon resistors are placed along the diaphragm's edges, which is then suspended over a vacuum cavity to form an absolute pressure sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Pressure changes alter the [[impact_and_applications_of_silicon_wafers_in_technology | silicon]] band structure, changing the crystal's resistivity, which is then sensed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Today, the medical MEMS-based sensor industry is valued at over six billion dollars, with blood pressure sensors being the largest segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Consumer Electronics
Manufacturers have developed a range of versatile, low-power inertial MEMS-based sensors from initial pressure and accelerometer designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. These are found in popular consumer electronics, such as the Nintendo Switch, which incorporates ultra-low power inertial sensors with gyroscope and accelerometer capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

MEMS micro-machining technologies are also used in other consumer electronics, including visual displays, optical switches, and micro-mirrors that redirect light between optical fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Design and Production Considerations

The core idea behind most commercial MEMS production is to leverage high-volume IC [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | techniques]] like photolithography and etching to build 3D shapes from 2D substrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. However, there is no universal [[design_and_production_techniques_for_mems | methodology]], leading companies to explore alternative micro-machining methods such as electrochemical micro-machining, laser beam machining, and electrode discharge machining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

MEMS share commonalities with integrated circuits (ICs) but differ fundamentally in design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. MEMS design is highly specialized; miniaturizing objects doesn't guarantee identical performance, as forces like friction become more dominant than inertia at the micro scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Unlike VLSI, which revolutionized semiconductor design with modular, standardized components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, mechanical design, including MEMS, is highly custom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. ICs primarily process signals, while mechanical objects must manage liquids, rotation, sliding, or supporting loadsâ€”often simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Despite these challenges, companies like CoventorWare and IntelliCAD are developing CAD and design automation software to assist MEMS designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

## Packaging and Cost Challenges

Testing and packaging, the "back end" of the semiconductor production process, are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. For MEMS-based sensors, packaging accounts for 75% to 80% of the final cost, a significant reversal from integrated chips where packaging is a secondary support role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. For example, a raw MEMS pressure sensor die from a foundry costs less than 50 cents, but its packaging can raise the total price to $20-30 for an HVAC application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

This cost disparity arises because MEMS must intimately interact with the outside world, requiring custom packaging for each specific application (e.g., a pressure sensor needs different packaging than a micro-mirror array) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This customization adds substantial engineering and production costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

## [[the_future_and_potential_of_the_mems_industry | The Future of MEMS]]

MEMS has been dubbed the "second [[impact_and_applications_of_silicon_wafers_in_technology | silicon]] revolution" due to its ability to create microscopic moving parts that perform functions of much larger objects, offering advantages in size, cost, and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. However, the industry's success has led to challenges: its creativity and diversity hinder the establishment of widespread standards, and it lacks unifying bodies like SEMATECH or DARPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. To realize its full potential, the various playersâ€”designers, foundries, vendors, and end-usersâ€”need to collaborate more closely to create standards and resolve long-standing issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

In 1979, the Soviet Union became the world's leading oil producer, pumping 11.5 million barrels daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This marked a significant shift from the end of the 1960s, when the Soviet Union was the second-biggest oil-producing nation globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Much of this growth was driven by the development of oil and natural gas reserves hidden beneath Siberia's frozen swamps and lakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The pursuit of these resources was a major factor in the Soviet Union becoming an [[soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | energy superpower]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The West Siberian Basin

The Soviet West Siberian Basin, located about 600 miles east of the Ural Mountains, is a vast, flat area covering 3.4 million square kilometersâ€”nearly five times the size of Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Approximately one-third of this area, almost one million square kilometers, is potentially oil-bearing, exceeding the combined size of Texas and Oklahoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

This region is largely undeveloped, harsh, and remote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It experiences short summers and long, severe winters, with temperatures plummeting to negative 27 degrees Celsius, making frost and fog common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Swamps and lakes cover 60 to 70 percent of the area, and these lakes freeze solid for 9 or 10 months of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Consequently, the area is sparsely populated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Beneath these challenging lands lie some of the world's largest oil and gas deposits, second only to those in the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. These deposits, dating back to the Triassic and Jurassic periods, include the massive Urengoy gas field and Russia's largest oil field, Samotlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Samotlor partially overlies the Siberian Traps, a site of one of the largest known eruption events in world history 250 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Initial Reluctance and Shifting Priorities

As far back as the 1930s, Soviet geologists predicted that the West Siberian Basin held significant deposits, potentially larger than those in the Volga-Ural province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Despite several potential oil gushers being found, the Soviet government initially refrained from exploring and developing these fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Some high-ranking Communist Party members dismissed the claims as "the fruit of a sick provincial imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Circumstances eventually compelled the Soviets to change their stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. From the mid-to-late 1960s, the Volga-Ural oil fields, the primary source of [[postwar_soviet_union_oil_industry_developments | postwar Soviet Union oil industry developments]], began to decline much faster than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Between 1971 and 1975, the decline in European oil fields was 261 million tons, significantly worse than the planned 150 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

The oil production business was critical for the Soviets for two main reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>:
*   It was the country's largest source of foreign currency, providing over 50% for purchasing goods like wheat from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   The Soviets had long-term oil export obligations to Eastern Bloc countries, all of which (except Romania) depended on them for energy, supplied through extensive pipelines like Druzbha ("Friendship") or Bratsville ("Brotherhood") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Political Push and Infrastructure Development

In January 1968, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin visited the Tyumen region of West Siberia, highlighting the area's potential for advancing the Soviet economy and the urgent need for infrastructure development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Two years later, in 1971, Brezhnev personally pushed for the urgent development of West Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

A new ministry was established to build oil infrastructure in the region, headed by Boris Shabina, a high-ranking Ukrainian Communist Party member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Although Shabina later gained renown for managing the Chernobyl crisis in 1986, he was instrumental in founding the West Siberian oil and gas industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges and Attracting Workers

West Siberia presented immense [[challenges_faced_in_the_extraction_and_production_of_oil_in_siberia | challenges faced in the extraction and production of oil in Siberia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Unlike Baku, which had a growing urban area, or the Volga-Ural region, which saw population surges due to the war, West Siberia was virtually uninhabited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. To tap its resources, the Soviets had to create entire towns from scratch and bring in hundreds of thousands of geologists, builders, and work crews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Building worker settlements was difficult due to the harsh conditions, and since agriculture was impossible, all food had to be transported by rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This resulted in a cost of living 1.5 to 1.7 times higher than in European parts of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Unlike the Stalin era, workers in the Soviet Union now had freedom of choice, so incentives were necessary to attract people to this "wasteland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Salaries in West Siberia were 2.2 to 2.5 times higher than elsewhere, and promotion was easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The party ran media campaigns in older oil and gas regions, seeking specialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Most workers were young (under 35) and signed up for short periods to earn substantial money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Rapid Production Growth

West Siberia quickly began yielding its vast riches:
*   **1965:** 5.6 million tons of oil and 1.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **1970:** Oil production reached 31 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **1975:** Oil production surged to 141 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **1977:** An "insane" 211 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

By 1973, 113 oil fields had been discovered, including five billion-ton supergiant oil and gas fields between 1965 and 1973, such as Samotlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

To transport products to buyers in Europe, the Soviets built long gas pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. In the second half of the 1970s, they laid 1,400 kilometers of pipeline, moved 130 million cubic meters of soil, and tore up 27.2 million square meters of agricultural land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Pipeline construction was expedited by trucking ready-made pieces from factories to sites, leading to rates three to five times faster than in the West and costs per kilometer a third of Western averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Economic Success and Environmental Cost

Economically, the development was a major success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. However, environmentally, it was a disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The rapid construction was possible due to a complete disregard for ecology, resulting in wastewater pollution, torn-up swathes of taiga, and hundreds of abandoned drilled wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. The Soviets prioritized fulfilling economic plans "no matter what" over environmental concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Despite warnings about sustainability, the government continuously pushed West Siberia to generate more and more oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Stagnation and Decline

The rapid growth of West Siberia's oil dominance initially coincided with international conflicts in the 1950s and 60s, which made European nations seek diversification away from Arab oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Soviet oil became a compelling alternative, leading to deals with Austria (1968), Italy (1969), West Germany (1970), and France (1972) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. The oil crises of the 1970s, including the Iranian Revolution, further accelerated these exchanges, cementing long-lasting energy relationships despite the Soviet Union's reputation as an erratic trade partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

However, the expectation that West Siberia's energy output would grow indefinitely was incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Production stalled and declined almost as quickly as it grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. From 1975, West Siberia's oil production growth rates rapidly fell, from 23.8% in 1976 to 7% in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. This stagnation had massive ripple effects across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. The average annual growth rate of [[soviet_oil_production_in_the_1960s | Soviet oil production in the 1960s]] (9.1%) fell to just 6.2% between 1971 and 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. By 1981, the country's total oil growth rate was under one percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Without access to more advanced Western oil drills and pumps, the Soviets resorted to doubling their exploratory drilling efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. The amount of drilling increased from 13 million meters in 1977 to over 26 million in 1984, with 16 million of that new drilling occurring in West Siberia alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This meant exploratory teams had to travel further, drill deeper, and work in more complex formations, doubling per-meter drill costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Despite these efforts, Soviet oil output fell into negative growth in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

This led to the [[economic_impact_of_oil_production_on_the_soviet_economy | economic impact of oil production on the Soviet economy]] as the energy industry and the wider Soviet economy found themselves investing more to produce less, caught in a cycle of "throwing good money after bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. The Soviet economy became more energy-intensive, with nearly half of its oil consumption coming from heavy industry, which lacked the flexibility of Western economies to cut consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. The country's considerable oil export obligations further limited its ability to reduce consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

## Legacy and Impact

By the late 1980s, the Soviet Union remained the world's largest producer of oil and third-largest producer of coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Yet, despite this, its economy stagnated, consumed by its unproductive energy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Coherence within the Eastern Bloc faded as the Soviets prioritized their own needs, leading satellite states to turn to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

The oil price collapse of 1986, driven by increased output from Alaska, the British North Sea, and OPEC, was devastating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Prices fell from $27 a barrel to below $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. All the investment into oil suddenly turned to loss, and foreign currency earnings evaporated, paving the way for the debt crisis that contributed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union a few years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

The exploitation of West Siberian oil and gas, while initially providing high energy revenues, arguably papered over the need for much-needed economic reforms within the Soviet economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. It allowed the country to buy necessary goods and technology from the West rather than develop its own capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. Thus, energy simultaneously supported the Soviet Union, keeping it standing longer than it might have, while also weakening its ability to sustain itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. The legacy of the [[soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union as an energy superpower]] and its [[influence_of_soviet_oil_exports_on_international_relations | influence of Soviet oil exports on international relations]] continues to impact European and Asian politics today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

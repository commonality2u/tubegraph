The success of TSMC is attributed to its "brilliant, maniacally driven people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>, including several key figures who were instrumental in its early technical and leadership advancements. Many of these individuals returned to Taiwan from the United States to contribute their talents to the growing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Key Figures and Contributions

### Morris Chang
The most famous of the American migrants, [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | Morris Chang]] was the founder of TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. He retired as CEO in 2005 at the age of 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a> but returned in June 2009 to guide the company through challenging years after a botched 40-nanometer ramp-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Liang Mong Song (梁孟松)
Liang Mong Song was one of TSMC's founding geniuses, described as unquestionably brilliant but difficult to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. He rose through TSMC's ranks for nearly two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

*   **Early Life and Education**
    *   Graduated from NCKU, a prestigious engineering university in Tainan, Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
    *   Continued his studies in the United States, attending graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
    *   Studied under Professor Hu Ten-ming, who would become a TSMC legend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   Received his PhD and worked at AMD for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    *   Named in over 180 critical semiconductor patents and published over 350 technical papers in the US and Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Return to TSMC**
    *   In 1992, at age 40, Liang quit his job at AMD and returned to Taiwan to join TSMC's R&D department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   He was a specialist in FinFET technology, which would play a critical role in TSMC's transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
    *   He is named on nearly 500 TSMC patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Key Achievement: Copper Interconnects**
    *   In 2003, Liang, along with Chiang Chang Yi and Berlin, led a team of six elite R&D scientists to develop TSMC's own 130-nanometer process node with copper interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
    *   This allowed TSMC to overtake IBM, which had invented the technology but couldn't bring it to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   This accomplishment earned him the 2003 Outstanding Scientific and Technological Worker Award from the Taiwan government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Compensation and Personality**
    *   He was handsomely rewarded, earning over $21 million USD in stock and cash compensation over 17 years at TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. In the 2000s, he made over $1 million annually in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
    *   Despite his brilliance, his stubborn nature led to frequent clashes with colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, often described as "inflexible" and "aloof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Hu Ten-ming (胡正明)
Professor Hu is considered a TSMC legend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. He was one of the company's first technical hires and eventually served as their Chief Technology Officer (CTO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. In the mid-2010s, he helped bring the FinFET to market, enabling [[tsmcs_technological_advancements | TSMC's technological advancements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Chiang Chang Yi (蔣尚義)
Chiang Chang Yi was an R&D team leader and later a CTO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. He retired as Senior VP of R&D at TSMC at age 59, becoming an advisor to the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. He was part of the team that developed TSMC's copper interconnect implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Rick Tai (蔡力行)
Rick Tai, with a PhD and experience at Hewlett-Packard, was Deputy Director of TSMC's early fabs and served as COO for four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. He was Morris Chang's chosen successor as CEO in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. He briefly served as TSMC's CEO and is now the CEO of MediaTek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Douglas Yu (余振華)
Douglas Yu, from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Bell Labs, is a TSMC Distinguished Fellow today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. He was also a member of the team that developed the copper interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Collective Impact

These brilliant executives, alongside others like Berlin, Yang Guang Lei, and Sun Yuan Chang (Jack Sun), helped TSMC navigate numerous technically challenging decisions, allowing the company to [[tsmcs_technological_advancements | leapfrog its rivals]] repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Their collective efforts, such as the in-house development of copper interconnect technology, were critical events that enabled TSMC to overtake established industry leaders like IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The early R&D team's decision to reject IBM's copper interconnect license and develop their own, investing significant resources, proved to be a pivotal moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

The story of these individuals underscores that in the semiconductor industry, despite the massive investment in machines like EUV, it is ultimately the people who are most important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>.

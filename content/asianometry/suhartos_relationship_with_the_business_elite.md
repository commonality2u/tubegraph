From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Indonesia's authoritarian leader, Suharto, deeply relied on a select group of collaborators to manage the economy, notably a personal friend, Lim Soe Liong (also known as Sudono Salim) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Lim Soe Liong, founder of the [[rise_of_the_salim_group_and_lim_soe_liong | Salim Group]], became Southeast Asia's richest man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The [[rise_of_the_salim_group_and_lim_soe_liong | Salim Group]]'s incredible expansion was largely due to its close ties with Suharto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Origins of Military-Business Ties

The close and often corrupt intertwining of the military and business community predates Suharto's presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. In the 1950s, the Republican government frequently failed to adequately fund its fighting units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This led commanders to unite with local businessmen, often ethnic Chinese, referred to as *kukong* (Hokkien for "boss"), to raise necessary funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. These businessmen received favors and concessions in exchange for funneling cash to military personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. After Indonesia gained independence and Dutch assets were nationalized, the military became increasingly involved in providing daily services, from shipping to hotels and timber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

Lim Soe Liong, born Lin Xiaolian, arrived in Java in 1938 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. During Indonesia's struggle for independence against the Dutch (1945-1949), Lim launched a supplies business, smuggling essentials like soap, coffee, sugar, and rice to the Indonesian Republican Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. His hard work and good personality impressed soldiers, leading their logistics officer, Cilardi, to introduce Lim to his cousin, Suharto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Suharto, appointed commander of the local division in Semarang in 1956, rekindled and deepened his friendship with Lim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Suharto valued reliability, and Lim consistently delivered, even if it meant personal loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Over time, Lim became Suharto's go-to person for all financial matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. As Suharto rose through the military ranks, he, in turn, became Lim's patron and protector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Suharto's New Order and Crony Capitalism

After Suharto assumed power in March 1966, declaring a "New Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, he initiated [[economic_policies_and_reforms_in_suhartos_indonesia | economic reforms]] by rebuilding the tax base and opening the country to foreign capital and aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This development plan resulted in consistent economic growth throughout his reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. However, this new growth also provided ample opportunities for corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Suharto established a system of [[crony_capitalism_in_indonesia | crony capitalism]], where his government partnered with and relied on economic cronies in the private sector to achieve government goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. These cronies received preferential benefits to help execute those goals and generate profits, which were then redistributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Profits often flowed upwards to Suharto and his elite circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Suharto ensured that his Chinese business partners, like Lim, remained economically powerful but relied on him for political protection, thereby separating economic and political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Lim, initially just one of Suharto's Chinese *kukong*, rapidly became the most significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Key Business Examples

*   **Cloves**: In 1966, Lim was granted one of two exclusive licenses to import cloves from Africa, a critical ingredient for Indonesia's popular *kretek* cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. While Lim's company received a small percentage, the majority of the profits went to a slush fund controlled by the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This provided crucial early funds for Lim to expand into more lucrative sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Flour and Food**: After wheat gained popularity in Indonesia, Lim partnered with Malaysian tycoon Robert Kwok to found Bogasari Flour Mills in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Bogasari quickly secured a monopoly on the import, milling, and distribution of wheat for Western Indonesia, covering 80% of the country's population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This business was immensely profitable, with 25-35% profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Again, 26% of the company's profits were channeled to foundations headed by Suharto and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. The [[rise_of_the_salim_group_and_lim_soe_liong | Salim Group]]'s food business later became Indofood, a massive conglomerate and one of the world's biggest instant noodle producers, controlling 90% of the Indonesian market throughout the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Cement**: Following Indonesia's five-year development plan to build domestic cement capacity, Suharto directed Lim to enter the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Lim, with help from Taiwan's Tuntex Group, built a massive cement complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. During the 1970s oil export boom, Lim developed one of the world's largest cement companies, eventually controlling 60% of Indonesia's total cement production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. When oil prices tumbled in 1984, Suharto ordered the government to purchase 35% of what is now PT Indocement, effectively bailing out Lim's business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Banking**: Lim had acquired a small company with a banking license in the 1950s, which he renamed Bank Central Asia (BCA) and moved to Jakarta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Shares were distributed to Suharto's generals and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. After recruiting banker Mukhtar Riady in 1975, BCA grew immensely, becoming Indonesia's biggest private bank in just three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

By the end of the 1970s, the [[rise_of_the_salim_group_and_lim_soe_liong | Salim Group]] had grown from three companies in 1957 to about 54 companies across six fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This growth accelerated, with over 225 Lim-affiliated businesses making nearly a billion dollars in revenue by 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. By 1989, estimates suggested more than 350 companies were affiliated with Lim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>, many holding monopolies or near-monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

## The Rise of Suharto's Children and Public Discontent

By the 1990s, Suharto, in his 70s, was becoming "out of touch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. His children, now grown, began to wield significant political influence, sidelining trusted advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. Their incompetence and self-interest began to erode public opinion against the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

An infamous example occurred in 1990 when Suharto created a single clove monopoly for his youngest son, Tommy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. This forced every *kretek* manufacturer to buy cloves from a single source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. The 28-year-old Tommy ran the industry into the ground, forcing Suharto to order Bank Indonesia to contribute $350 million to bail out the monopoly and restore clove deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

## Fall from Power and the Asian Financial Crisis

The [[impact_of_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | Asian financial crisis]] beginning in July 1997 profoundly affected Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. The rupiah lost over 30% of its value, leading to a surge in foreign-denominated debt for Indonesian banks and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. Intense competition from 1989 banking reforms and high non-performing loans led to widespread insolvency among smaller banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

Rumors and bank runs ensued, even targeting seemingly rock-solid banks like BCA, costing it $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. The IMF intervened with a $33 billion bailout package in October 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. This bailout came with stringent [[economic_policies_and_reforms_in_suhartos_indonesia | economic reform]] conditions, including dismantling state and private monopolies, cutting subsidies, and further opening up the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. Many of these reforms directly attacked the monopolies controlled by Suharto's cronies and family, hitting his supporters when he needed them most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

Relations between the government and the IMF deteriorated, leading the IMF to withhold payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>. In May 1998, mass riots erupted in response to fuel subsidy cuts, targeting ethnic Chinese and their businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. A pro-democracy student movement also protested for Suharto's resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. His cabinet members abandoned him, and on May 21, 1998, Suharto resigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

The riots severely damaged [[rise_of_the_salim_group_and_lim_soe_liong | Salim Group]] companies, including BCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. The bank's association with a government crony turned against it, leading to a "titanic run" on the bank, causing its collapse and forcing the central bank to take over it and its $5 billion in debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. The massive and largely insolvent [[rise_of_the_salim_group_and_lim_soe_liong | Salim Empire]] began to break apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.

Ultimately, the [[rise_of_the_salim_group_and_lim_soe_liong | Salim Group]] handed over its stakes in over 100 Indonesian businesses, like Indocement and Indomobil, to repay the $5 billion government bailout for BCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. Crucially, the Salim family retained a 50.1% share in Indofood, strategically moving those holdings offshore to their First Pacific financial company in Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.

## Legacy

Suharto's governance brought substantial [[economic_policies_and_reforms_in_suhartos_indonesia | economic benefits]] to Indonesia, with 7% annual economic growth and the development of agricultural and manufacturing bases over his 32 years in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. However, the "dark side" of this growth was whom it enriched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. While the nation became richer, Suharto made himself, his cronies, and his family arguably richer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

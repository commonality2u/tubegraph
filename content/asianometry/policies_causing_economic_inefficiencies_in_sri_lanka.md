Sri Lanka, once known as Ceylon, gained independence in 1948 after over 150 years as a British colony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Initially, it had significant advantages, including a strategic trading port location, no infrastructure damage from World War II, high rankings in education and public health, and a democratic government considered a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The country also inherited a highly productive export economy specializing in tea, rubber, and coconuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. In 1950, Sri Lanka's GNP, adjusted for purchasing power parity, was higher than India, Pakistan, Thailand, and even [[social_inequality_and_economic_reforms_in_south_korea | South Korea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Despite this promising start, a series of fateful policy choices and uncontrollable events led to an economic decline, ending early optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The country's [[history_of_sri_lankas_economic_development | economic development]] has since been closely studied, with recent events adding a bitter new page to its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Early Post-Independence Policy Missteps

After independence, the 1948 Sri Lankan constitution was primarily based on discussions between Sinhalese elites and colonial administrators, failing to address the concerns of ethnic minorities, particularly the Tamils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This lack of broad-based consensus sowed seeds for future instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

The first general election brought the conservative United National Party (UNP) to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. To counter rising leftist ideologies, the UNP implemented expensive food subsidies and disenfranchised Indian Tamils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. These subsidies were initially financed by booming commodity prices from World War II and the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. However, when the Korean War ended in 1953, commodity export revenues crashed, forcing the government to raise rice prices and other public service costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This led to widespread protests known as the Hartal, causing the Prime Minister's resignation and the UNP's loss in the 1956 election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Shift Towards Import Substitution and Ethnic Tensions

The new government elected in 1956 marked a worsening of relations between Sinhalese and Tamil communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Ethnic harmony was not a priority, and Sinhala was instituted as the country's only official language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

Economically, the government imposed import restrictions on consumer goods to conserve foreign currency and established state monopolies to domestically fulfill these demands, a policy known as import substitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. While such policies were used by East Asian economies like Taiwan and [[social_inequality_and_economic_reforms_in_south_korea | South Korea]] to industrialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, Sri Lanka's wide-ranging application led to inefficiencies because the government tried to do everything itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Domestic products became more expensive, and import demand shifted from finished goods to imported raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Price shocks in raw goods, such as the 1970s oil crises, filtered directly to finished goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This approach led to inefficiencies and corruption due to close relations between businessmen and the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

By the 1970s, Sri Lanka had transformed from a relatively open, market-based economy into one of the most closed non-communist economies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Economic growth dramatically slowed, and the country's development fell behind its peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. For example, in 1977, Sri Lankan per capita income was $200, a modest increase from $141 in 1960, while [[social_inequality_and_economic_reforms_in_south_korea | South Korea]]'s had surged to $820 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

The country's "crown jewel," the plantation economy, fell into disarray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Threats of nationalization since 1958 caused foreign companies to stop investing, leading to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. When nationalization finally occurred in the 1970s, operations were overseen by six ministries with overlapping powers and conflicting concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

The government became the country's employer of last resort, doubling its GDP share from 1961 and providing over 50% of manufacturing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Policies in higher education exams and public sector employment favored Sinhalese elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This unequal scenario bred radical ideologies among minority Tamil youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Limited Liberalization and Renewed Policy Challenges

The economic slowdown eventually built political will for change, leading to a new government in 1977 that attempted reform and opening up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. They aimed to attract foreign investors and establish a labor-intensive export development economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Initial reforms included establishing free trade zones, guaranteeing against nationalization, devaluing the currency, and attempting to limit state participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Growth surged from 2.9% to 6% annually between 1977 and 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

However, the government failed to properly manage the initial negative impacts of liberalization, which hit the poorest hardest through inflation, removal of food subsidies, and lifting trade protections on farmed goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Money from subsidies and foreign aid was wastefully channeled to loss-making state-owned companies and questionable mega-infrastructure projects, like a new capital and housing program, which did not make economic sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Authoritarian tactics against Tamil protests ignited a cycle of violence, leading to the devastating civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This [[impact_of_ethnic_tensions_on_sri_lankas_economy | ethnic tension]] and conflict significantly hampered long-term economic progress.

## Post-Civil War and Debt-Fueled Growth

After the civil war ended in 2009, a new administration under Mahinda Rajapaksa, initially saw significant economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. However, policies shifted away from economic liberalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. In 2012, export tariffs were reimposed on tea and rubber, aiming to encourage domestic processingâ€”a return to import substitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

The main drivers of growth between 2004 and 2013 were not labor-intensive manufacturing but rather debt-fueled public sector construction and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Sri Lanka regularly breached deficit reduction agreements with the IMF, and its annual debt-to-GDP ratio steadily increased, hitting nearly 87% in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. These mega-projects, such as the Colombo Port City, often had questionable economic viability and showed signs of corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

[[sri_lankas_shift_from_manufacturing_to_debt_funded_infrastructure | Manufacturing as a share of GDP]] declined from a peak of nearly 20% in the early 2000s to 15% later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. The manufacturing that did grow focused on servicing the domestic sector (food, beverage, tobacco) rather than export-oriented industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Domestic dissatisfaction increased, leading many Sri Lankans to seek work overseas; remittances from migrant workers became a major economic driver, covering over 85% of the country's forex shortfalls in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

## Vulnerability to External Shocks

The [[sri_lankas_shift_from_manufacturing_to_debt_funded_infrastructure | shift from manufacturing to debt-funded infrastructure]] and reliance on remittances reduced Sri Lanka's resilience to external shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. The [[effect_of_the_pandemic_on_sri_lankas_economic_crisis | COVID-19 pandemic]], coupled with previous events like the 2019 suicide bombings, crippled key foreign exchange earners like garment exports, remittances, and tourism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

In response, the government doubled down on import substitution for items like fertilizer to preserve foreign reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. However, this led to domestic shortages, power cuts, rationing, and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. The Sri Lankan rupee depreciated significantly against the US dollar, worsened by extensive money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.

The economic hardship was a long time coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. The way out of the crisis requires coherent political leadership, debt restructuring, a return to economic reform, and improved relations with the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

Todor Zhivkov assumed leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party in 1953, following Stalin's death, and remained in power for 35 years until 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:17">[02:17:17]</a>. His relatively moderate rule provided the People's Republic of Bulgaria with unprecedented political and economic stability during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:32">[02:27:32]</a>.

## Economic Policy and Industrialization
Before Zhivkov's rule, Bulgaria was largely a poor, agricultural economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. After World War II, the Bulgarian Communist Party, with the aid of the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union]] (which offered loans, raw materials, and bought Bulgarian finished goods at generous terms), began rebuilding the economy, modeling their policies after the Soviets' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

Under Zhivkov, the Bulgarian Communist Party's economic policy shifted focus towards producing machinery and tools for heavy industry sectors such as mining, energy, and metallurgy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

### Admiration for Japan and Electronics
Zhivkov openly admired the Japanese economy and sought to guide Bulgaria's economic development along a similar path, believing that Japan's top industries were heavy industry and electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. He expressed a personal passion for electronics, seeing it as Bulgaria's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

## Development of the [[rise_and_fall_of_the_bulgarian_computer_industry | Bulgarian Computer Industry]]
Zhivkov's administration actively supported the burgeoning computer and electronics sectors:
*   **Early Support**: In 1965, the ELKA 6521 electronic calculator was demonstrated to Zhivkov and the Politburo, gaining their approval for further development and exhibition abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.
*   **Resource Allocation**: The Council of Ministers, under Zhivkov's influence, allocated significant resources, labor, and even capitalist currencies to develop the electronics industry, identifying it as a profitable export sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.
*   **Establishment of IZOT and IGCCT**: In 1967, Bulgaria established DSO IZOT, an industrial conglomerate dedicated to developing and producing calculating machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. Zhivkov's close associate, Professor Ivan Popov, played a crucial role in securing Bulgaria's significant position within the Intergovernmental Commission on Computing Technology (IGCCT), an international organization formed by the [[challenges_faced_by_the_soviet_economy_in_its_later_years | Soviet Bloc]] countries to produce a Unified System of Computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Monopolies**: Through Popov's efforts and Zhivkov's backing, Bulgaria secured a monopoly on critical computer components within the [[role_of_comecon_and_soviet_influence_on_bulgaria | COMECON]] bloc, such as memory disks and magnetic memory tapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. This allowed Bulgaria to export these products at high prices, achieving margins of nearly 200-300% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Buoyancy**: These electronics exports, combined with a highly favorable [[economic_impact_of_oil_production_on_the_soviet_economy | Soviet oil re-export deal]], significantly supported the Bulgarian economy throughout the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>.
*   **Pravetz Computers**: The Pravetz line of personal computers, produced in Zhivkov's hometown, became widely popular in Bulgaria, with production scaling from 500 units in 1983 to 18,000 two years later, and many Bulgarians learned programming on these machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>. At its peak, the Pravetz factory produced about 60,000 computers annually, many of which were exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:51:00">[20:51:00]</a>.

### [[bulgarias_semiconductor_and_electronics_industry_development | Semiconductor Industry]]
Alongside the growth of computer production, Zhivkov's government established the Institute of Microelectronics in 1967, fostering the development of Bulgaria's [[bulgarias_semiconductor_and_electronics_industry_development | semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. This rapid advancement enabled the production of integrated circuits, including the IC for the ELKA-42, which was highlighted as the first IC-based electronic calculator at the Osaka World Expo in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.

## Setbacks and Decline
Despite these initial successes, Zhivkov's leadership and Bulgaria's close ties to the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union]] eventually contributed to [[bulgarias_technological_advancements_and_setbacks | setbacks]] and the eventual decline of the electronics industry:
*   **Investment Stagnation**: In the late 1970s, the Bulgarian government halted investment in microelectronics, possibly due to military and heavy industry priorities, which impeded the country's ability to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>. This led to reliance on imported foreign-made ICs, increasing costs and making Bulgarian products less competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>.
*   **Political Interference**: Zhivkov's alignment with the Soviet Union led to critical missed opportunities. In the early 1980s, a technology collaboration deal with the American company Rockwell to build semiconductors was blocked by Soviet authorities, who feared it would bring Bulgaria too close to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>. This was a devastating blow, forcing more sophisticated Bulgarian computers to rely on imported chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:12:00">[23:12:00]</a>.
*   **Internal Political Struggles**: Zhivkov's blunt political style eventually led to conflicts. In 1974, he removed Professor Ivan Popov from the Politburo and sent him to Switzerland as ambassador after Popov proposed building mainframes in direct competition with the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union]] and East Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.
*   **Loss of Soviet Support and Fall**: Zhivkov's long rule ended in November 1989 when he lost the support of the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union]] and faced domestic opposition after a botched assimilation drive of the ethnic Turkish minority. He resigned at the behest of senior Communist Party members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>.

## Aftermath
Following Zhivkov's resignation and the subsequent collapse of the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union]] in 1991, the [[rise_and_fall_of_the_bulgarian_computer_industry | Bulgarian computer industry]] faced rapid decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:05:00">[24:05:00]</a>. 95% of Bulgaria's electronics revenue came from within the [[challenges_faced_by_the_soviet_economy_in_its_later_years | Soviet Bloc]], and with this market gone, and the industry's reliance on Western-sourced critical components (which became prohibitively expensive due to currency weakening), it collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:00">[24:10:00]</a>. The influx of cheap South Korean and Taiwanese PCs into newly opened Bulgarian markets further accelerated the industry's demise, with factories closing by 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:00">[24:44:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
Todor Zhivkov's leadership significantly shaped Bulgaria's economy, particularly through his ambitious push for industrialization and the development of the electronics and computer sectors. His vision, inspired by Japan's economic model, led to remarkable [[bulgarias_technological_advancements_and_setbacks | technological advancements]] and economic successes, allowing Bulgaria to become a significant exporter of electronics within the [[role_of_comecon_and_soviet_influence_on_bulgaria | COMECON]] bloc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. However, Bulgaria's deep reliance on the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union]], a cornerstone of Zhivkov's foreign policy, ultimately limited its long-term technological progress and market reach, contributing to the industry's rapid collapse once the Soviet system disintegrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:16:00">[25:16:00]</a>.

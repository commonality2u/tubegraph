From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

In its early years, the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] attempted to establish a society without money, a policy that resulted in disaster despite the country already being devastated by war and revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The Bolsheviks aimed to immediately create their ideal socialist utopia, a moneyless society, which paradoxically involved printing hundreds of billions of rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This period represents the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union's]] initial, devastating foray into Communism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Marxist Economic Theory and Money
Classical economists viewed money as a neutral facilitator of trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Karl Marx, however, acknowledged this but believed classical economists downplayed money's societal role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Marx posited two main problems with money:
*   **Cyclical Booms and Crises**: Money contributed to cycles of overproduction and underproduction in capitalist economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Capitalists, focused on profit (M to C to M Prime where M Prime > M), would hoard money if profit wasn't guaranteed, leading to periodic, simultaneous production booms and crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Exploitation and Alienation**: Marx saw money as the means by which the bourgeoisie extracted wealth from the working class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Wages were not commensurate with the value produced by workers, causing alienation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Marx argued that money would be unnecessary in a centrally planned socialist society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The notion of eliminating money was widespread among the Bolsheviks, who considered it a fundamental aspect of their desired economy for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Russia's Pre-Bolshevik Economic State
Prior to the Bolshevik takeover, Russia's economy was severely strained by World War I:
*   **Abandonment of Gold Standard**: Russia abandoned the gold standard in June 1914, four days after entering the war, and began printing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Deficit Spending**: The Imperial government ran a 39% deficit in the first year of the war and 75% in the two subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Economic Decline**: The war led to large government budget overruns, foreign borrowing, physical destruction, collapsing economic output, and high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Industrial Collapse**: Between 1913 and 1917, the number of industrial workers in Russia declined by 16.4%, and total industrial output fell by 22.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Rising Inflation**: By early 1917, paper rubles in circulation increased to 9 billion from 1.6 billion in July 1914, a 5.5 times increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Russia's 1917 deficit was 82% of its budget, with 73% funded by the printing press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

When the Bolsheviks seized power, they inherited an economy already grappling with [[hyperinflation_and_economic_crisis_in_soviet_russia | hyperinflation and economic crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918 further exacerbated this, causing Russia to lose a third of its population, nearly a third of its agricultural land, and over half its industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Key resources like 97% of its oil output from Baku and the Caucasus, and Ukraine's 78% of coal, 74% of iron ore, and 80% of grain, became inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. The Russian Civil War meant Bolshevik control over Ukraine wasn't reliable until 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

Despite Russia's semi-industrialized and largely agricultural state, which was "not ideal for transitioning to socialism," the Bolsheviks proceeded with their plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Bolshevik Economic Policies: War Communism
Lenin outlined the construction of the new Russian socialist economy in "The Immediate Tasks of Soviet Rule," aiming to establish a "dictatorship of the proletariat" and centralize all economic activities under a single national plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Nationalization of Banks
Marx believed banking was central to capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The Communist Manifesto listed establishing a central bank as the first step towards state control of production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Russia's financial system was highly centralized, with 12 banks holding 80% of the country's capital, making nationalization swift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   On November 20, 1917, the People's Commissar of Finance seized the Russian State Bank (Goss Bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   Private banks were ordered to fund worker-controlled factories, but they refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   In December 1917, Bolshevik troops occupied major banks, transferring their capital to Goss Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   By the end of 1918, all banks were liquidated and merged into Goss Bank, which ceased lending, instead only keeping accounts of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   This nationalization choked the flow of credit, leading to 405 enterprises and 205,000 workers closing down in the first quarter of 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Nationalization of Industry and Funding the Civil War
In June 1918, the Council of the People's Commissar announced the nationalization of industry, a crucial step in the transition to socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   Railways, shipping, and mining were nationalized throughout late 1918 and early 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   This process was chaotic; less than 14% of nationalizations were managed by the central government, with the majority handled by local organizations and trade unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   The chaotic nationalization led to the ejection of many skilled workers and business owners, as new owners often lacked the expertise to run the machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

During the Russian Civil War (mid-1918 to end of 1919), the Bolshevik government prioritized supplying the Red Army, utilizing all available labor and resources for the war effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Funding Crisis**: The war and nationalization strained the treasury, but the government had no way to fund expenses without printing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. No one would lend to the Bolshevik government after it repudiated foreign debts and nationalized assets in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Taxation Issues**: Income taxes in 1918 only provided 7.3% of total budget spending, forcing the Bolsheviks to break promises by raising indirect taxes and introducing an "extraordinary income tax" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **[[hyperinflation_and_economic_crisis_in_soviet_rush | Hyperinflation]]**: By the end of 1918, inflation hit 598%, with over 60 billion rubles in circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The value of rubles, measured against 1913 values, had fallen from 2.4 billion in 1917 to just 222 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Food Policies and Further Demonetization
Food shortages were a major problem, with Lenin telegraphing in January 1918, "for God's sake take the most energetic and revolutionary measures to send grain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Grain Monopoly**: The Tsarist government had introduced a grain monopoly during WWI, requiring farmers to deliver surpluses to the state at fixed prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. The Provisional Government continued it, and the Bolsheviks reaffirmed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   **Disincentive for Production**: The crashing ruble meant wages no longer mattered to peasants, who refused to sell goods at official prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. The government, seeing the issue as distribution rather than production, responded by "requisitioning" food, further discouraging surpluses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Food Dictatorship**: In May 1918, the Bolsheviks declared a "food dictatorship," reaffirming the grain monopoly and permitting armed force to seize food from peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

[[hyperinflation_and_economic_crisis_in_soviet_russia | Hyperinflation]] intensified. In May 1919, the People's Bank announced it would print as much money as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Inflation doubled from 598% to 1,376% in 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. The ruble's value fell so rapidly that budgets were published retroactively, making planning impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Money printing costs consumed 45-60% of the mint's budget in the second half of 1919, yet ministries, including the war ministry, received less than 40% of their requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

Amazingly, the Bolsheviks interpreted [[hyperinflation_and_economic_crisis_in_soviet_russia | hyperinflation]] as a sign their socialist transformation was succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Their goal was to devalue money to nothing, annihilating the power of the wealthy, transitioning to state distribution, and creating a moneyless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. However, this also showed their continued reliance on the old capitalist system to fuel their industrial and war machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

After the Red Army largely won the Civil War by April 1920, the Bolsheviks, emboldened, intensified policies to demonetize and nationalize the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   The state aimed to control the entire supply and distribution system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   In December 1920, Lenin signed decrees making public services like transportation, telegraph use, medicines, food, consumer goods, fuel, and postage free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   Private trade and money were to be banished, with the government controlling all inputs and outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
*   Taxes and wages were paid "in kind" (physical goods rather than cash); by 1921, 93% of wages were paid this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   Suggestions for new accounting units included physical properties, salt, cooperative funds, or the "tread" (a day of simple labor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. These proposals only confused people and proved impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

By 1921, the only currency was the [[hyperinflation_and_economic_crisis_in_soviet_russia | hyper-inflating ruble]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
*   In 1921, the government issued 16.3 trillion new rubles, but still ran a deficit of 21.9 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
*   In 1922, this issuance swelled to 1.97 quadrillion new rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

## Consequences of War Communism
By 1921, the Soviet government realized War Communism had gone too far, leading to the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Russian economy]] falling into ruins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Economic Collapse**: The state was unprepared to centralize control of every item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Illegal markets thrived, providing most people's food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Production of items like steel, sugar, and bricks virtually ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Overall industrial production fell to a third of pre-war 1913 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. This represents a period of [[soviet_industrial_growth_and_technological_lag | Soviet industrial stagnation]].
*   **Labor Issues**: Without money, there was a total lack of incentive to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Worker desertion rates in railways hit 40%, and a worker in 1920 produced only 45% of their pre-war output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   **Humanitarian Crisis**: [[hyperinflation_and_economic_crisis_in_soviet_russia | Hyperinflation]] devastated the Russian people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. Daily caloric intake in 1919 fell by 30% from the 1910s average (from 3,820 to 2,680 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. A famine broke out in 1921, lasting into 1922, killing 5 million people, largely due to food requisitioning leaving nothing to fall back on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.
*   **Social Unrest**: Despite the end of the Civil War, peace did not return. Peasant revolts, notably the Kronstadt rebellion in 1921, shook Lenin's conviction in the current direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## Shift in Policy: New Economic Policy (NEP)
Lenin realized that market activity had to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. In March 1921, the New Economic Policy (NEP) was implemented to reverse the economic decline, grow output, and stabilize the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. This marked a significant [[rise_and_decline_of_soviet_economic_strategies | shift in Soviet economic strategies]].
*   By 1923, the Soviet government fully reversed course, issuing a gold-backed currency, making its Central Bank independent, and rebalancing the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.
*   The rebellions subsided, and output began to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
*   Lenin reflected on the period, admitting, "we were caught up as we were in the wave of enthusiasm...we were counting on utilizing this enthusiasm directly to accomplish economic tasks that were equally important. Life has shown how wrong we were" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. He attributed the mistakes of the War Communism years to Civil War interruptions, viewing the NEP as the true path forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

Despite Lenin's later rationalization, the state's intention during War Communism was to forcibly transition the country away from capitalism, create a trade monopoly, and eradicate money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. However, these [[economic_policies_and_challenges_under_communist_rule | economic policies and challenges under Communist rule]] instead led to chaos, violence, and a catastrophic collapse in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This highlights the early [[soviet_economic_stagnation_and_need_for_reform | Soviet economic stagnation and the need for reform]] that defined this initial period.

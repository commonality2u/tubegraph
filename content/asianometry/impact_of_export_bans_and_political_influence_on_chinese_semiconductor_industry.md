Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) is China's ambitious project to replace ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Recent high-profile [[impact_of_export_bans_on_semiconductor_technology | export bans to China]] have brought special focus to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Historical Context and Government Initiatives
China's first lithography machine, the GK3, was created in 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. By 1978, the GK4 prototype, a contact lithography machine, was able to print chips on 75-millimeter wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. At this point, China was two decades behind the United States, which invented and commercialized contact lithography in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Subsequent efforts included the development of proximity aligner prototypes in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> and a stepper in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. However, a significant technology gap remained; China began research on machines using argon fluoride lasers (193 nanometer wavelength) in 2000, while the West began shipping such devices in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This led the government to believe a change of direction was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

SMEE was founded in March 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. China's 12th five-year plan (2011-2015) included lithography as the second-highest national special project, known as the "Zero Two Special Project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This project aimed to:
*   Develop manufacturing equipment capable of producing 22 to 45 nanometer processed chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   Conduct forward research on 14 to 22 nanometer processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   Work on 65 to 90 nanometer special processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Capture at least 10 percent of the domestic lithography market and attempt to open up the international market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

SMEE was designated as the country's national champion to achieve these goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The company has received extensive support from both local and central Chinese governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, with the Shanghai SASAC (the commission overseeing the city's corporate assets) being SMEE's single biggest owner with 32 percent of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Impact of Export Restrictions on Strategy and Capabilities
SMEE encountered [[impact_of_export_bans_on_semiconductor_technology | import restrictions]] from its inception, particularly for high-level optics from Carl Zeiss of Germany, which could not be imported into China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This restriction forced SMEE to target a less competitive segment of the lithography market, specifically lithography for advanced packaging processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The strategy was to gain experience in back-end lithography and then move to front-end lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This approach has been successful in the back-end market, where SMEE holds 80 percent of the domestic market and 40 percent of the global market for back-end lithography, shipping over 50 units in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

However, SMEE still faces challenges in securing critical components due to [[impact_of_export_bans_on_semiconductor_technology | export bans]]. Core technologies must be imported or purchased from foreign companies, including:
*   Photo masks from Japanese companies Toppan Printing and Dai Nippon Printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   Ball bearings from Sweden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   Valves from France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   Grating alignment systems from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Without these imported components, it is difficult to ship a commercial-grade, working machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. For its optics, SMEE relies on companies like Changchun Up Optotech and Beijing Guowang Technology Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, and for its light source, Beijing RS Laser Opto Electronics Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. However, RS Laser's product is underpowered compared to what ASML uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Beijing Guowang's optics manufacturing factory is not expected to be completed until September 2023, making a 2024 ship date for immersion-ready optical systems ambitious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Current Status and Challenges
As of August 2021, SMEE systems are primarily for 90 nanometer, 110 nanometer, and 280 nanometer processes, which are specialized for back-end lithography, LEDs, MEMS, and power devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The majority of SMEE's systems use eyeline and krypton fluoride lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

SMEE's most advanced system, the SSA 600-20 scanner for front-end manufacturing at the 90 nanometer node, uses an argon fluoride laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. A prototype of this product, the 600-10, first profiled in 2011, could process about 50 wafers an hour, significantly less than comparable Canon and Nikon machines which can do five times that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. As of 2019, the 600-20 was not selling in relevant quantities, with SMEE's recent sales still in outdated eyeline lithography machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

SMEE's most prominent future product is an argon fluoride immersion (ArF-e) system, said to be capable of the 28 nanometer process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This 28 nanometer tool is currently a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. China has generally been good at building prototypes, lagging the leading edge by about 10 years (the 28 nanometer node first shipped around 2011) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. However, the challenge is moving from prototype to high-volume commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. China has historically struggled to commercialize its prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. The goal to deliver commercial-ready 28 nanometer ArF-e machines by 2021 or 2022 is likely to be missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

One example of exaggerated claims by Chinese media is the 2018 announcement by the Institute of Opto-Electronics Technology of a 22 nanometer "super resolution" lithography tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. While CCTV claimed it could achieve sub-10 nanometer levels with multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, the tool was not commercially ready, had low accuracy, and a field of view of only a few square millimeters, making it extremely slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. In contrast, ASML's comparable Twinscan NXT:1970Ci has a field of view of 858 square millimeters and can do over 250 wafers an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

## Human Capital and Corporate Culture
The difference in corporate culture and employee benefits between SMEE and ASML also poses a challenge. While entry-level college graduates at SMEE might make around $45,000 USD a year, and PHDs about twice that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, ASML's company-wide average salary is comparable to SMEE's average PhD salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. ASML offers significant benefits like share purchase plans, pension plans, commuting allowances, 40 days of paid leave, and holiday allowances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. SMEE, lacking ASML's capital base (ASML is valued at $300 billion), struggles to offer comparable benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

As a "national champion," SMEE has adopted Huawei's working practices, characterized by:
*   Long working hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   Considerable political intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
*   Tough annual assessments for bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   A "Jack Welch-style" bottom five to ten percent layoff each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

This Huawei-inspired approach is likely to hinder SMEE's ability to acquire and retain top talent compared to ASML, which prioritizes employee development and reducing turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## Outlook
While there is significant cheerleading and optimism in the Chinese press regarding SMEE's efforts, often referring to photolithography as the "Mount Everest of the intelligent manufacturing industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, the reality is that SMEE is at least 20 years behind ASML in bringing a commercial-ready upper-class lithography device to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Immersion lithography is nascent, and EUV is even farther away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Even Chinese sources acknowledge this reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

Despite these challenges, [[developments_in_chinas_domestic_semiconductor_ecosystem | China's semiconductor production equipment ecosystem]] is not "dead on arrival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. Progress in back-end lithography and LED lithography is heartening, especially as China gains market share in the display industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Some Chinese companies have built strong track records in specific semiconductor equipment areas, with one even acquiring TSMC as a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

SMEE is considering an IPO in the future, with valuations possibly in the $5-10 billion range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. An IPO would release new information in their prospectus, providing a clearer picture of their progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Despite Indonesia's cuisine not being particularly known for wheat, the country is the world's second-biggest consumer of instant noodles, with 14.5 billion servings consumed in 2023 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10"></a>. Approximately 99% of its 285 million people have eaten instant noodles at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16"></a>.

Nigeria stands out on the list of top instant noodle consumers, largely due to the immense popularity of the Indonesian noodle brand Indomie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31"></a>. Indomie is likely the single most popular packaged food in all of Africa and is even occasionally mentioned in rap lyrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40"></a>.

## Beginnings

Indomie's dominant position today can be traced back to Indonesia's authoritarian second President, Suharto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25"></a>. Suharto frequently partnered with Chinese entrepreneurs, who often became wealthy, to industrialize the economy and finance his activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35"></a>. The most famous of these was Liem Sioe Liong, also known as Sudono Salim, and his Salim Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41"></a>. At its peak, the Salim Group was an Indonesian chaebol with assets exceeding $20 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47"></a>. This era also saw the rise of [[crony_capitalism_and_its_role_in_building_Indonesias_largest_business_empire | crony capitalism]] in Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30"></a>.

In 1967, Suharto sought food aid from the US government in the form of rice, but the US and Australia sent wheat instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02"></a>. Since Indonesia lacked milling facilities, the raw wheat had to be milled in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07"></a>. Salim, seeking advice on wheat, consulted Malaysian Chinese tycoon Robert Kuok in late 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16"></a>. Kuok advised Salim to build mills directly in Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27"></a>.

In 1969, Salim and Kuok partnered to found Bogasari Flour Mills on swampy land along Jakarta Bay that Salim owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38"></a>. Bogasari quickly became the dominant flour miller in Indonesia, holding a concession to supply flour to the Java and Sumatra regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45"></a>. Robert Kuok initially received a 25% share in Bogasari, but lost it when Salim merged Bogasari into his Indocement company, leaving Kuok feeling "flushed out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11"></a>.

## Instant Noodles & Indomie

Instant noodles were first popularized by Taiwanese-Japanese entrepreneur Momofuku Ando, who developed the flash-frying method and founded Nissin company, which is now the second-largest noodle giant globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27"></a>.

In 1972, Indonesian entrepreneur Djajadi Djaja founded Indomie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38"></a>. The name "Indomie" translates to "Indonesian Noodles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49"></a>. Indomie was not the first instant noodle brand in Indonesia; Supermi launched two years earlier with Japanese technical assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02"></a>. However, while Supermi used imported flour, Indomie sourced its flour locally and cheaply from Bogasari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08"></a>. This contributed to the [[history_of_instant_noodles_in_Indonesia | history of instant noodles in Indonesia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56"></a>.

### From Flour to Noodles

Initially, the Salim Group primarily sold flour from Bogasari to noodle and bread-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13"></a>. Indonesians traditionally preferred rice over wheat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24"></a>. However, during a rice shortage in the late 1970s, the Indonesian government requested Bogasari to promote alternative foods for military and civil officials to conserve rice for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34"></a>. Bogasari invested in expensive instant noodle machinery and launched marketing campaigns to promote flour-based products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43"></a>.

By the 1980s, Indonesia achieved rice self-sufficiency due to new strains and fertilizers, which became a business challenge for Bogasari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05"></a>. Bogasari had acquired capacity for 2 billion packs of instant noodles annually, but the government no longer needed them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15"></a>. To utilize this excess capacity, Bogasari launched its own instant noodle brand, Sarimi, directly competing with its customer, Indomie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29"></a>.

Sarimi quickly captured 40% of the market due to low production costs from its integrated milling business and a $10 million marketing campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41"></a>. Faced with this competition, Djajadi merged Sarimi and Indomie into a joint venture called Indofood in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58"></a>. A few years later, Indofood also acquired Supermi, consolidating the Indonesian instant noodle market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04"></a>.

Initially, Salim owned 42.5% of the joint venture, but eventually acquired the rest of Djajadi's shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10"></a>. Djajadi claimed he was forced to sell after falling into debt, and he sued Indofood for compensation after Suharto's fall, though the Indonesian Supreme Court ruled against him after a seven-year legal battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31"></a>. These events highlight the [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_Chinese_businesses_in_Indonesia | challenges and controversies faced by ethnic Chinese businesses in Indonesia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25"></a>.

## Spreading Out

For years after its early 1970s launch, Indomie was primarily sold as a soup format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43"></a>. In 1982, Indomie launched a soup-less dry version called Mi Goreng ("fried noodles"), which became an instant hit due to its easier preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56"></a>. By 1994, Indofood controlled about 80% of the Indonesian instant noodles market through its three brands: Indomie (60%), Supermi, and Sarimi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01"></a>.

Instant noodles are cheap, easy to cook, and taste great due to MSG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11"></a>. The low price is particularly important, with urban dwellers often consuming Indomie Sayur (Indomie with green vegetables) as a complete meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24"></a>. Indofood offers over 110 flavors to accommodate Indonesia's diversity, though Mi Goreng remains the most popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33"></a>. Indomie's halal status also contributes to its popularity in the world's largest Muslim population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42"></a>. This demonstrates the [[cultural_adaptation_of_food_products | cultural adaptation of food products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33"></a>.

In the late 1980s, Indomie began its international expansion, initially spreading by word-of-mouth as Indonesian foreign workers brought it abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53"></a>. Over time, Indofood established partnerships with local companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57"></a>. Indomie has seen significant success in the Middle East and Africa, likely aided by its halal status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07"></a>. In Saudi Arabia, Indomie claims over 95% of the instant noodle market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10"></a>. There's even an Indomie factory in Syria that has remained operational throughout the civil war, providing cheap food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16"></a>. This illustrates [[Indofoods expansion into African markets | Indofood's expansion into African markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03"></a>.

## Nigeria

Nigeria is a highly diverse country with over 500 ethnolinguistic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51"></a>. Its tropical agriculture supports fruits, cotton, palm trees, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02"></a>. Nigerian cuisine blends indigenous carbohydrates like yams and cassava with beans, meats, and various sauces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14"></a>. Colonial influences from the Portuguese and British introduced New World vegetables, curry, potatoes, and chicken, as seen in dishes like Jollof Rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25"></a>.

Crucially, traditional Nigerian cuisine does not feature wheat or wheat-based noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45"></a>. Despite this, Nigerians consumed about 3 billion servings of instant noodles in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51"></a>.

## From India to Indonesia: The Tolaram Corporation

In the early 1920s, Khanchand Vaswani, from British India's Sindh province, traveled to Indonesia for trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02"></a>. After the Partition of India, his family fled to Mumbai and then Singapore, eventually arriving in Surabaya, Indonesia, in March 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23"></a>. In Malang, Vaswani founded Toko Vaswani, a textiles shop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06"></a>. In 1950, it became the Tolaram Corporation, expanding into chain retail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13"></a>.

Tolaram grew by sourcing products in bulk directly from manufacturers, gaining a price advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24"></a>. In the late 1960s, they opened a procurement center in Singapore, moving their headquarters there in 1975 for international trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43"></a>. Tolaram diversified into pulp, chemicals, and paper products, and held stakes in factories worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54"></a>.

In 1977, Mohan Vaswani, Khanchand's son, was advised to explore Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08"></a>. After visiting Nigeria, Ivory Coast, and Ghana, he decided to open shop in Nigeria due to its large population, relatively higher per capita income, and lack of consumer electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18"></a>. Tolaram became one of the first Singaporean companies to do business in Nigeria, trading electronics, textiles, and fishing nets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28"></a>. This period was risky due to military rule and a foreign exchange crisis in the early 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37"></a>. However, as a family-controlled company, Tolaram could invest for the long term, with its first textile factory in Nigeria losing money for almost nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54"></a>.

## Indomie in Nigeria

In 1988, Tolaram began importing noodles from Indofood to Nigeria, an idea from Haresh Aswani, who saw Indomie's success in Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10"></a>. Nigeria's population was similar to Indonesia's: young, fast-growing (3% annually), and increasingly urban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29"></a>. Despite challenges like limited access to clean water and low daily income, noodles were priced affordably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46"></a>.

Tolaram initially positioned Indomie as a food for children, targeting busy mothers with an average of five children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59"></a>. However, the launch was difficult; Nigerians initially mistook the noodles for worms and didn't know how to cook or eat them, being accustomed to eating with their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19"></a>. Tolaram hired people to conduct demonstrations in supermarkets, schools, and even during traffic jams to educate consumers on preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43"></a>. Despite these efforts, sales volumes were slow for the first six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50"></a>.

## Going Local

Committed to the product, Tolaram sought to reduce costs, particularly the 40% freight cost from importing 40-50 containers a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05"></a>. In 1995, they formed a joint venture with Indofood called De United Foods, gaining rights to manufacture, brand, and sell Indomie in West Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18"></a>. Tolaram built its first noodle factory in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29"></a>.

The joint venture continued to lose money for several years, to the point that Indofood considered pulling out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38"></a>. However, Tolaram requested another year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41"></a>. In June 2000, they launched a new flavor, Onion Chicken, accompanied by a major marketing promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44"></a>. Onion Chicken, along with other flavors like Pepper Chicken and Jollof, was a massive hit, catapulting Indomie to become the most popular noodle brand in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51"></a>.

It took 10 years for Indomie noodles to become profitable and 12 years to generate over $10 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04"></a>. After that, sales doubled each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10"></a>. By 2004, a second plant was producing 40 million noodle packs monthly, increasing to a billion packs per month by 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16"></a>. Today, over half a dozen plants across Africa produce Indomie noodles for Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt, and Eswatini, maintaining dominance despite over 17 new competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22"></a>. This growth exemplifies [[Indofoods expansion into African markets | Indofood's expansion into African markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22"></a>.

## A Consumer Giant

Indomie's success, starting in 2000, transformed Tolaram's business strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37"></a>. The [[Impact of the Asian financial crisis on Indonesian businesses | Asian Financial Crisis]] of 1997 and China's rise convinced Tolaram that B2B commodity products had no future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42"></a>. They scaled down most existing businesses like electronics assembly and textiles to focus on consumer brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47"></a>.

This shift required significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58"></a>. When suppliers struggled to provide noodle raw ingredients in the late 2000s, Tolaram vertically integrated, opening its own packaging, seasoning, flour, and oil mills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03"></a>. Furthermore, due to Nigeria's poor infrastructure (only 18% paved roads, 75% non-functional trains), Tolaram had to "pull in" basic services like electricity, water, and waste processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12"></a>.

Tolaram's long-term commitment and operational experience in Nigeria, particularly through its robust distribution company Multipro, made it an ideal platform for other consumer brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30"></a>. They formed joint ventures with Kellogg (2015) for cereals and snacks in West Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41"></a>, Arla (Danish-Swedish dairy cooperative) for dairy products in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47"></a>, and Colgate-Palmolive (2019) for dental health products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58"></a>. In June 2024, Tolaram acquired a majority stake in Guinness Nigeria Brewery from Diageo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05"></a>.

Beyond consumer goods, the Tolaram Group has also ventured into large-scale infrastructure and real estate projects in West Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33"></a>. In 2019, they raised approximately a billion dollars to build the Lekki Deep Sea Port near Lagos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40"></a>. The port, capable of handling massive container ships, operates under a 45-year concession from the Nigerian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49"></a>. Tolaram aims for the port to become the core of a larger industrial ecosystem called the Lagos Free Zone, a privately-owned free trade zone for foreign companies to sell imported goods in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04"></a>.

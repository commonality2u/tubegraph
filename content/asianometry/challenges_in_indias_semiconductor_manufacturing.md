Despite being a global leader in [[indias_design_capabilities_in_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor design]], India faces significant [[challenges_of_working_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenges]] in establishing its own semiconductor manufacturing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While nearly every major semiconductor company has a presence in India for designing advanced chips, these designs are sent abroad to countries like the United States, China, South Korea, or Taiwan for fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. India currently imports 100% of its chips, including logic and memory, from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

## Historical Attempts and Challenges

### Early Efforts and SCL

In the 1980s, the Indian government sought to emulate countries like China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, and Singapore by developing its own semiconductor manufacturing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This led to the founding of Semiconductor Complex Limited (SCL) in 1984, a 100% state-owned enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. SCL was envisioned as the foundation for a native Indian electronics industry, with a goal to design and manufacture leading-edge circuits and electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The government invested between $40 to $70 million USD into the venture, a substantial amount at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. SCL was headquartered in Mohali, Punjab, an emerging electronics industry center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

SCL hired talented graduates from top technical universities like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, leveraging India's strong pool of skilled engineering talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. They also recruited from esteemed Indian electronics companies such as Bharat Electronics Limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Factors for Semiconductor Manufacturing Success

Successful semiconductor manufacturing requires four key factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>:

1.  **Financial Capital**
    *   **Requirement:** Enormous sums of money for expensive chip manufacturing equipment (especially photolithography) and chip testing equipment, which must be constantly upgraded and maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
    *   **India's Challenge:** Equipment must be imported from places like Europe or Japan, incurring import duties and requiring streamlined documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The sheer capital needed has been the single most significant obstacle for India in establishing a viable semiconductor manufacturing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Modern leading-edge chip factories cost tens of billions of dollars, a trend that accelerated around the 14-nanometer node generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Even major private Indian entities like Tata and Reliance find this difficult to absorb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

2.  **Human Capital**
    *   **Requirement:** Smart, well-educated people to run the fabrication plants, skilled labor familiar with expensive equipment, and PhDs for R&D to push processes forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
    *   **India's Strength:** India is strong in this area, with universities producing a skilled engineering workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. However, SCL experienced talent drain, with personnel constantly leaving for better jobs in the private sector or abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

3.  **Government/Infrastructure**
    *   **Requirement:** Substantial, nearly 100% government buy-in, as well as stable power and water supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Environmental concerns also exist due to the toxic manufacturing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
    *   **India's Challenge:** While government buy-in exists, infrastructure is a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. A single power outage or water shortage can ruin months of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

4.  **Manufacturing Technology Acquisition**
    *   **Requirement:** A way to acquire older process node technology to quickly catch up with the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
    *   **SCL's Approach:** SCL licensed 5-micron process technology from American Microsystems Inc. (AMI) in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. They also acquired process technology from Rockwell (for their 2560G microprocessor) and Hitachi (for electronic wristwatch components) as part of manufacturing deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. These technology transfer agreements allowed SCL personnel to train in the U.S. and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. SCL also performed third-party assembly, notably for the BBC Acorn computer for the Indian government's computer literacy program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. By the late 1980s, SCL advanced rapidly to a 0.8-micron process, being only one semiconductor generation behind the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## The Devastating SCL Fire

In 1989, a devastating fire broke out at SCL, ending hopes of India becoming a global semiconductor manufacturer within a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The cause is unknown, though arson has been speculated due to SCL's military contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. However, semiconductor fires are common due to flammable chemicals, and the incident was most likely an accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Fires cause extensive damage due to toxic fumes and corrosive gases, further exacerbated by sprinkler systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

It took SCL eight years and over $50 million USD to restart production in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. During this time, new entrants like TSMC (founded 1987) and Samsung had entered the race and rapidly gained global market share, leaving India far behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### SCL's Decline and Restructuring

After the fire, the government's proposals to revive SCL failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Attempts to sell the fab to private investors failed due to disagreements on terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Retooling the fab from telephone exchange chips to smart card chips also did not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

In 2005, SCL was restructured as an R&D Center within the Department of Space and renamed Semiconductor Lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This effectively ended its chances of being a competitive commercial entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. SCL had long been out of the race, with most revenue coming from government contracts, and its offerings were not competitive even in the domestic market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. The lack of economies of scale meant it could not turn a profit; in its final year as a company (2005-2006), SCL produced 1,000 6-inch wafers, despite having 20 times the installed capacity, and incurred a $2 million USD loss on $3.5 million revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

Today, SCL primarily conducts R&D with its old 6-inch wafer fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. In 2019, they announced the ability to accept chip designs at the 180-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. However, this progress has been extremely sluggish, taking nearly a decade to reach that node after working on it since at least 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Modern Challenges and Unsuccessful Government Efforts

[[government_efforts_and_obstacles_in_reviving_indias_semiconductor_industry | The Indian government has since attempted to revive the country's semiconductor manufacturing efforts]], but all these efforts have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

*   **2006 Fab City Project:** A $3 billion Fab City project for manufacturing was announced, with AMD initially interested in an assembly and test facility, but bad industry conditions halted it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **2013 Customs Duties:** Customs duties were lifted on all imports of parts and machinery for semiconductor manufacturing, but this did not stimulate foundry efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **2014 Fab Proposals:** India approved proposals from two investor groups to build fabs totaling approximately $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The government offered significant financial support (25% of total cost), interest-free loans, tax breaks, and subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
    *   The first consortium, involving Jai Prakash (JP) Associates, Israel's TowerJazz, and IBM, pulled out in 2016 due to JP's debt and the plant not being commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
    *   The second consortium, led by Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (HSMC) with expertise from STMicroelectronics and Siltera, also failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. In 2019, the government canceled HSMC's letter of intent due to its failure to submit commitment documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

Since these failures, no serious Indian manufacturing proposal has emerged, even amid current market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## Current State and Implications

Today, India lacks substantial semiconductor fabrication capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. In 2019, India imported $21 billion worth of semiconductors, a number growing at about 15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

*   **Supply Chain Vulnerability:** In 2020, India was severely impacted by the [[the_impact_of_global_semiconductor_supply_chain_issues_on_india | worldwide semiconductor shortage]], disrupting critical businesses like smartphone manufacturing, where India is the world's second-largest maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Repercussions:** A significant portion of these imports, 37% in 2019 ($7 billion worth), originates from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Given the tense Sino-Indian relations, this poses critical geopolitical repercussions and potential future disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

While India possesses world-class chip design capabilities and a strong pool of human talent, there is a lack of consistent, long-term direction and sufficient financial commitment from the top to establish manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. The market has moved beyond a phase where a private entity can seed a thriving semiconductor manufacturing industry without external help; the government must do more to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

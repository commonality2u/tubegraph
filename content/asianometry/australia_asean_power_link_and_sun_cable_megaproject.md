The Australia-ASEAN Power Link is a mega-project, also known as the "Sun Cable" after the Singaporean company developing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Its goal is to transport renewable solar energy from Australia to Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Motivation for Singapore

[[singapores_reliance_on_natural_gas_for_electricity | 95% of Singapore's electricity comes from burning natural gas]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. As a small island, Singapore lacks space for large solar or wind farms, beyond some rooftop solar panels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This project offers a way to pipe in electricity from overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Project Overview

The Sun Cable project proposes a 10 gigawatt capacity solar farm occupying 12,000 hectares in Australia's Northern Territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Solar panels would be prefabricated in Australia and assembled on-site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Generated electricity would first travel 500 miles (800 kilometers) to Darwin, contributing to the city's renewable energy goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The remaining power would be exported to Singapore via an intercontinental 2,300-mile (3,700-kilometer) HVDC underwater power line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. A battery system near the solar farm is proposed to store excess power for overnight demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The solar farm and battery storage are estimated to cost around $7 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The project is still in the planning stages, so details may change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Power Transmission Technology: HVDC

The transmission distance of 2,300 miles (3,700 kilometers) is immense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This requires specialized power transmission.

### AC vs. DC for Long Distances

Electric current comes in Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. AC flows in alternating directions, while DC flows in only one direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Most modern systems use AC because AC power transmission systems are generally more economical for shorter distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Transformers can efficiently step up voltage for transmission to reduce energy losses, and then step it down for consumer use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

However, high voltage AC systems lose efficiency over long distances due to factors like the "skin effect," where AC flows more densely at the surface of a cable, increasing resistance and power loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Systems

High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) systems were developed to address the shortcomings of AC for long-distance transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. While experiments date back to the 1880s, the first modern HVDC subsea cable was implemented in 1954 in Sweden by ABB, linking Gotland island to the mainland (90 km) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

HVDC systems include converters and inverters to convert AC power to DC and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. While this equipment is expensive, it provides substantially better economics for transmitting power across long distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

*   **Cost-Distance Dynamics**: HVDC has a substantially higher terminal cost than AC due to complex conversion equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. However, the cost of the line itself rises faster with AC than DC due to significantly higher energy losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. For example, a 1,200-mile (2,000-kilometer) AC line can have twice the losses of a DC line, even carrying half the power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Breakeven Distance**: DC becomes more cost-effective than AC beyond a "breakeven distance" of roughly 62 miles (100 kilometers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Sun Cable Losses**: Assuming electrical losses for HVDC are about 3% per 1,000 kilometers, the Sun Cable's 3,200 kilometers is estimated to have about 10% electrical loss in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. An equivalent HVAC line would likely have over twice that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Applications**: HVDC makes renewable energy sources like offshore wind or hydro economically viable for long-distance transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. It is also perfect for undersea infrastructure where intermediate substations are not practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

There are over 6,000 miles (10,000 kilometers) of subsea HVDC lines globally, with 70% in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Australia already has Basslink, a 230-mile (370-kilometer) HVDC cable connecting Tasmania to Victoria, which is owned by a Singaporean company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## [[subsea_cable_laying_and_its_technical_challenges | Challenges in Laying and Protecting Undersea Cables]]

[[challenges_in_laying_and_protecting_undersea_cables | Laying subsea cables]] involves two main rules of thumb:
1.  Keep the cable length as short as possible to minimize costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
2.  Avoid big deep trenches and steep slopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

Most existing subsea power cables are laid in relatively shallow depths (under 0.6 miles or 1 kilometer) on flat, silty, sandy, or pebbled seabeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. However, Australia is surrounded by steep slopes and deep water, which will pose a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Proposed Route and Deepwater Challenges

The most economical and practical route for the Sun Cable would start from Darwin, cross the Timor Sea south of East Timor to Indonesia, pass between Indonesian islands (Bali and Lombok or Lombok and Sumbawa), and then run up the Java Sea to Singapore's Changi area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

While most of the route would be shallow (less than 600 feet or 200 meters deep), a 700-mile (1,200-kilometer) section south of East Timor in the Timor Trough would encounter waters over a mile deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This is a major challenge, though similar depths have been managed by the SA.PE.I cable from Sardinia to the Italian mainland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Special attention would be required, such as using lighter aluminum cables instead of traditional copper to allow more cable to be carried and laid from a vessel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Shallow Water Interference and Protection

For the shallower sections, significant interference is a concern. The Java Sea and Singapore Strait are among the busiest waterways globally, with numerous pipelines, fishing trawlers, and communication cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. To protect the cable from fishing nets, boat anchors, and other dropped objects, engineers will likely need to trench or bury it 2-5 feet (0.6-1.5 meters) deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Cable damage can lead to blackouts and trigger liability clauses in service agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Manufacturing Capacity

A significant challenge is the niche and slow output of the HVDC cable manufacturing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The Sun Cable project requires two cables of 3,200 kilometers each, which is more than the total annual output of all HVDC cable manufacturers in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This necessitates setting aside additional money and 3-5 years to build up manufacturing capacity from multiple global manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Financing and Project Costs

The subsea cable portion of the Sun Cable project alone is projected to cost about $5.6 billion USD before insurance and administrative expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. The majority, $4.6 billion, is for the cable itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This is over six times the cost of the Basslink cable ($670 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Including the solar farm, the entire project is likely to exceed $10 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

Seed funding for the privately-owned Sun Cable corporation has come from Australian billionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. However, such a massive project will likely require a multi-decade service agreement between the company and the power purchasing entity, similar to how Basslink derives cash flows from a 25-year agreement with Hydro Tasmania, attracting private investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Lessons from Basslink

Basslink experienced a brutal six-month outage less than ten years after its 2006 commissioning, leading to a $30 million USD fine for Basslink after arbitration in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Cash shortages reportedly led to a technical default, delaying repairs for another two-month outage in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. The Sun Cable developers hope to learn from these incidents to avoid similar mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## Broader Impact and Opportunities

The megaproject is likely to be broken into multiple chunks and milestones over many years due to its sheer size and immense cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Once fully deployed, the cable is expected to provide up to 20% of Singapore's energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

The opportunity extends beyond Singapore. Energy demand from Southeast Asian countries is estimated to expand by 65% from 2015 to 2040, mostly from fossil fuels unless clean energy alternatives are provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Indonesia might sign on to receive electricity before Singapore, as the cable passes through its waters first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

[[economic_and_environmental_impact_of_the_sun_cable_project | For Australia, the Sun Cable explores a new and exciting energy export paradigm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. The country's economy is heavily dependent on mining and petroleum exports, which contributes to global climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Australia's Northern Territory, larger than Egypt but with a sparse population, is one of the most solar-irradiated areas globally, offering significant renewable energy possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. This project will help cement better relationships with Southeast Asian countries and diversify Australia's export dependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

The project is scheduled to come online in 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) is China's ambitious project aiming to replace [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The company has gained significant attention in Chinese media, particularly after recent export bans to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The information for this comparison heavily relies on China-based sources, including a deep-dive profile by EqualOcean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Chinese Lithography Development History

China's first lithography machine, the GK3, was created in 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This evolved into the JKG3 two years later, marking the first domestically created lithography machine for large-scale commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

A contact lithography machine prototype, the GK4, followed in 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. It could print chips on 75-millimeter wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Contact lithography, where the photomask is in direct contact with the photoresist-coated substrate, was invented and commercialized by the United States in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This meant China was already two decades behind at this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

The subsequent commercial technology stages include the proximity aligner (introducing a gap between mask and substrate) and the step-and-scan device (stepper) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   In 1981, the Institute of Semiconductors of the Chinese Academy of Sciences developed two proximity aligner prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   By 1985, the 45th Institute of the Ministry of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering developed their own stepper, "inspired" by the US-based GCA's 4800 DSW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This machine printed designs using the 436 nanometer G-line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   China began research on machines using argon fluoride lasers (193 nanometer wavelength) in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Given that the West started shipping such devices in 1990, a large technology gap persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## SMEE's Foundation and National Mandate

SMEE was founded in March 2002, indicating a government decision to change direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. China's 12th five-year plan (2011-2015) included lithography as the second-highest priority among 16 major national special projects, known as the "Zero Two Special Project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

The Zero Two Special Project had several goals for China's lithography industry:
*   Develop manufacturing equipment for 22 to 45 nanometer processed chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   Conduct forward research on 14 to 22 nanometer processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Work on 65 to 90 nanometer special processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   Capture at least 10% of the domestic lithography market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   Attempt to open up the international market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

SMEE was designated as the national champion responsible for achieving these objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The company's first office was in the Shanghai Zhangjiang High-Tech Park, surrounded by semiconductor neighbors like SMIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Ha Rong Ming, the founding general manager and chairman, dedicated over a decade to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

> [!INFO] SMEE's R&D and Government Support
> Over two decades, SMEE has developed products through extensive R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. As of 2019, it filed over 3,000 patents and received 1,600, with nearly 700 in foreign countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The company receives extensive support from both local and central Chinese governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Shanghai SASAC, overseeing the city's corporate assets, is SMEE's largest owner with 32% of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Business Model and Technological Focus

SMEE encounters import restrictions, notably for high-level optics from [[partnership_between_carl_zeiss_and_asml | Carl Zeiss]] of Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. As a result, SMEE initially targeted advanced packaging lithography, a less competitive segment with less strict requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This strategy aimed to allow the company to gain experience in back-end lithography before moving to front-end lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

This strategy has been effective:
*   SMEE products hold 80% of the domestic back-end lithography market, corresponding to 40% of the global market in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   In 2019, they shipped over 50 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   Major back-end customers include Changjiang Electric Group, Taiwan-based ASE Group, and Tongfu Microelectronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   SMEE has also expanded into lithography tools for other niche semiconductor products like power devices, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and LEDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

Similar to [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]]'s model, SMEE aims to be the final system integrator for lithography tools, working with various suppliers for different parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Key Components and Supply Chain

The success of a lithography machine hinges on four core factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>:
1.  High precision optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>
2.  The light source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>
3.  High precision mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>
4.  [[role_of_software_in_asml_machine_development | Software]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>

For these components, [[asml_lithography_machine_operation and precision | ASML]] relies on companies like Kymer for light sources and a joint venture with [[partnership_between_carl_zeiss_and_asml | Carl Zeiss]] for optics, often holding significant equity or outright ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

SMEE's identified suppliers include:
*   **Optics:** Beijing Guowang Technology Company (Changchun Up Optotech was previously associated but is no longer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Beijing Guowang is building an optics manufacturing factory, but mass supply of immersion-ready optical systems is not expected until its completion (estimated September 2023) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Light Source:** Beijing RS Laser Opto-Electronics Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. RS Laser's product is underpowered compared to what [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] uses for its immersion systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

SMEE faces challenges with domestic suppliers, still relying on imports for core technologies like photomasks (mostly from Japanese companies Toppan Printing and Dai Nippon Printing), ball bearings from Sweden, valves from France, and grading alignment systems from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Although a Chinese company, Jiangsu Nata Opto-Electronic Material (Nata), has created a photomask that works in an [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] immersion system, it's just one example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Technological Gap and Product Performance

As of August 2021, SMEE's systems are available for 90 nanometer, 110 nanometer, and 280 nanometer processes, primarily specialized systems for back-end lithography, LED, MEMS, and power devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

Lithography systems are categorized by their laser light source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>:
*   Eyeline machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
*   Krypton fluoride laser machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
*   Argon fluoride laser machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
*   Argon fluoride immersion laser machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>
*   EUV machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>

The majority of SMEE's systems use eyeline and krypton fluoride lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Most Advanced SMEE System
> SMEE's most advanced system, the SSA 600-20 scanner for front-end manufacturing at the 90 nanometer node, uses an argon fluoride (ArF) laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. A prototype (600-10) was profiled in 2011, with a field size of 22x32 millimeters and processing about 50 wafers an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Comparable Canon and Nikon machines can do up to five times that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. As of 2019, the 600-20 was not selling in relevant quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Recent sales are still predominantly outdated eyeline lithography machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

SMEE is developing an argon fluoride immersion (ArFi) system, capable of the 28 nanometer process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This 28 nanometer tool is currently a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Historically, China has been good at building prototypes, lagging the leading edge by about 10 years (the 28nm node first shipped around 2011) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. However, China has struggled to turn prototypes into commercially competitive products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

The goal is to deliver commercial-ready 28 nanometer ArFi machines in 2021 or 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. However, this deadline is likely to be missed, as the critical optics supplier, Beijing Guowang, is not expected to complete its foundry until September 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. A 2024 ship date might be ambitious, and even then, the product is not expected to be commercially competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Discrepancy in Chinese Media
> Chinese news sources often inflate headlines. For example, in November 2018, the Institute of Opto-Electronics Technology announced a 22 nanometer "super-resolution" lithography tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, with CCTV suggesting sub-10 nanometer processes were achievable with multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. However, the tool was not commercially ready, had low accuracy, and a field of view of only a few square millimeters, making it extremely slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
> By contrast, [[asml_lithography_machine_operation_and_precision | ASML]]'s Twinscan NXT 1970ci (a DUV machine capable of 38 nanometer and below) offers a field of view of 858 square millimeters and can process over 250 wafers an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## Human Capital and Corporate Culture

There is a significant difference in how SMEE and [[asmls_future_technological_developments | ASML]] approach human capital.
*   **Salaries:** Entry-level college graduates at SMEE make about $45,000 USD annually, with PhDs making about twice as much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. SMEE's average PhD salary is comparable to [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]]'s company-wide average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. However, [[asmls_rise_in_the_lithography_industry | ASML]] offers significantly higher salaries for experienced staff, with software engineers making nearly $200,000 USD a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Benefits:** [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]] provides substantial benefits, including a share purchase plan, pension plan, commuting allowance, 40 days of paid leave, and an 8% holiday allowance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. SMEE has nowhere near [[asmls_rise_in_the_lithography_industry | ASML]]'s capital base (Europe's most valuable tech company at $300 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>, making it challenging to offer comparable benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Work Culture:** As one of China's national champions, SMEE has adopted working practices similar to Huawei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This includes long working hours, considerable political intervention, tough annual assessments for bonuses, and a "Jack Welch style" bottom 5-10% layoff each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. [[asml_lithography_machine_operation_and_precision | ASML]], in contrast, focuses on developing its people and reducing turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. SMEE's approach is likely to hinder its ability to acquire and retain top talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

Chinese media often portrays the photolithography effort as the "Mount Everest of the intelligent manufacturing industry," with significant cheerleading and optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Despite rhetoric about China's historical wisdom and technological achievements, the reality is that SMEE is at least 20 years behind [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] in bringing a commercial-ready upper-class lithography device to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Immersion lithography is nascent for SMEE, and [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | EUV]] is even farther away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Even Chinese sources acknowledge this reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Counterproductive Rhetoric
> Strong rhetoric and exaggerated claims can be counterproductive, leading to pessimism when deadlines are missed and preventing a focus on actual problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

Despite these challenges, China's semiconductor production equipment ecosystem is not "dead on arrival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Progress in back-end lithography and LED lithography is heartening, especially as China gains market share in the display industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Some Chinese companies have built strong track records in specific semiconductor equipment areas, with one even acquiring TSMC as a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

SMEE is reportedly considering an IPO in the future, with valuations estimated between $5 to $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. An IPO would release new information in their prospectus, potentially allowing for an update on their progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) is China's ambitious project aiming to replace [[ASML | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The company has gained significant attention, especially following recent export bans to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Historical Context and Technology Gap

China's first lithography machine, the GK3, was created in 1977, followed by the JKG3 in 1979, which was the first domestically created machine for large-scale commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The GK4 prototype, a contact lithography machine capable of printing on 75-millimeter wafers, came in 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Given that the United States invented and commercialized contact lithography in the 1950s, China was approximately two decades behind at this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Further development saw the creation of proximity aligner prototypes in 1981 and a stepper "inspired by" the US-based GCA 4800 DSW in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. By 2000, China began research on machines using argon fluoride lasers at 193 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. However, Western countries had started shipping such devices in 1990, indicating a persistent large technology gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## SMEE's Founding and Strategic Goals

SMEE was founded in March 2002, with its first office located in the Shanghai Zhangjiang High-Tech Park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. China's 12th five-year plan (2011-2015) ranked lithography as the second-highest national special project, known as the "Zero Two Special Project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. SMEE was designated as the "national champion" to achieve these goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

The project's goals included:
*   Developing manufacturing equipment for 22 to 45 nanometer processed chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Conducting forward research on 14 to 22 nanometer processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   Working on 65 to 90 nanometer special processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Capturing at least 10% of the domestic lithography market and attempting to enter the international market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

SMEE has developed its products through extensive R&D, filing over 3,000 patents by 2019, with nearly 700 in foreign countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The company has received significant support from both local and central Chinese governments, with the Shanghai SASAC (the city's corporate asset commission) being its single biggest owner with 32% of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Market Strategy and Product Focus

Due to import restrictions on high-level optics from companies like [[Carl Zeisss partnership with ASML | Carl Zeiss]] of Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, SMEE initially targeted areas of the lithography market with less intense competition and stricter requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

This strategy focused on:
*   **Lithography for advanced packaging processes**: This back-end lithography involves placing chips in protective casings and connecting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. SMEE now holds 80% of the domestic market in back-end lithography, corresponding to 40% of the global market in 2019, having shipped over 50 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Lithography tools for niche semiconductor products**: This includes power devices, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), and LEDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Front-end lithography**: SMEE eventually began developing for the front end, intending to sell to companies like Yangtze Memory and SMIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## Technological Comparison: SMEE vs. ASML

### Business Model and Component Sourcing
Unlike its Japanese competitors Canon and Nikon, SMEE is built on the [[ASML | ASML]] model, aiming to be the final system integrator for lithography tool parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The core factors for a machine's success are high-precision optics, the light source, high-precision mechanics, and software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

*   **Optics**: [[ASML | ASML]] relies on a joint venture with [[Carl Zeisss partnership with ASML | Carl Zeiss]] for its optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. SMEE's identified optics suppliers are Chang Chun Up Optotech (no longer associated) and Beijing Guo Wang Technology Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Beijing Guo Wang is building an optics manufacturing factory, which is not expected to be completed until September 2023, delaying mass supply of immersion-ready optical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Light Source**: [[ASML | ASML]] utilizes companies like Cymer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. SMEE's equivalent is Beijing RS Laser Opto Electronics Technology, whose product is underpowered compared to what [[ASML | ASML]] uses for its immersion systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Other Components**: SMEE still relies on foreign companies for several core technologies, including photomasks (mostly from Japanese companies Toppan Printing and Dai Nippon Printing), ball bearings from Sweden, valves from France, and grading alignment systems from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### System Capabilities and Performance
As of August 2021, SMEE's systems are available for 90 nanometer, 110 nanometer, and 280 nanometer processes, primarily specialized for back-end lithography, LED, MEMS, and power devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. The majority of SMEE's systems use eyeline and krypton fluoride lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Their most advanced system for front-end manufacturing, the SSA 600-20 scanner for the 90 nanometer node, uses an argon fluoride laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. A prototype of this product (the 600-10) was first profiled in 2011, processing about 50 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Comparable Canon and Nikon machines can process up to five times that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. As of 2019, the SSA 600-20 was estimated not to be selling in relevant quantities, with SMEE's recent sales still concentrated in outdated eyeline lithography machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

SMEE is developing an argon fluoride immersion (ArFi) system, said to be capable of the 28 nanometer process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. This 28 nanometer tool is currently a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. The 28 nanometer node began shipping around 2011, fitting a pattern where China lags the leading edge by about 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

A significant challenge for SMEE is moving from prototypes to commercially competitive products in high volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. While the goal is to deliver commercial-ready 28 nanometer ArFi machines by 2021 or 2022, delays in optical system foundry construction suggest a 2024 ship date might be ambitious, and even then, commercial competitiveness is not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

In contrast, [[ASML | ASML]]'s Twinscan NXT 1970Ci, a comparable DUV machine capable of the 38 nanometer node and below, offers a field of view of 858 square millimeters and can process over 250 wafers an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

## Human Capital and Working Culture

A notable difference lies in human capital management:
*   **Compensation**: Entry-level college graduates at SMEE make about $45,000 USD per year, with PhDs making roughly double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. SMEE's average PhD salary is about the same as [[ASML | ASML]]'s company-wide average salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. However, [[ASML | ASML]] offers higher salaries for some staff software engineers, nearing $200,000 USD a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
*   **Benefits and Work-Life**: [[ASML | ASML]] offers significant job benefits, including a share purchase plan, pension plan, commuting allowance, 40 days of paid leave, and an 8% holiday allowance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. [[ASML | ASML]] focuses on developing its people and reducing turnover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **Capital Base**: SMEE has nowhere near [[ASML | ASML]]'s capital base, which is Europe's most valuable tech company at $300 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Working Practices**: As a "national champion," SMEE has adopted Huawei's working practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. This means long working hours, considerable political intervention, tough annual assessments for bonuses, and a "Jack Welch-style bottom five to ten percent layoff each year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. This approach is likely to make it difficult for SMEE to acquire and retain top talent compared to [[ASML | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

## Market Position and Future Outlook

While Chinese media often portrays SMEE's efforts with steadfast cheerleading and optimism, calling photolithography the "Mount Everest of the intelligent manufacturing industry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, the reality is that SMEE is at least 20 years behind [[ASML | ASML]] in bringing a commercial-ready upper-class lithography device to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. Immersion lithography is still nascent for SMEE, and EUV is even farther away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. This reality is acknowledged even by Chinese sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

Despite these challenges, SMEE has shown progress in backend lithography and LED lithography, especially as China gains market share in the display industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. SMEE is considering an IPO in the future, with potential valuations in the $5-10 billion range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

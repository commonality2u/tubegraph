In late December 2024, Nissan announced a plan to merge with Honda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Described by some as more of a takeover rather than a merger, it has been characterized as a "shotgun marriage" hastily arranged by the Japanese government to save a company struggling to keep pace with modern developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Nissan's history has been marked by significant ups and downs, with this latest decline potentially signaling its end as an independent entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Background to the Merger
Nissan's journey has been tumultuous, characterized by periods of both success and significant [[challenges_faced_by_nissan_in_the_2000s_and_2010s | challenges]].

### The Carlos Ghosn Era
In 1999, [[carlos_ghosns_impact_on_nissan | Carlos Ghosn]], then Renaultâ€™s number two executive, joined Nissan as its new COO to lead a turnaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Renault invested 5 billion euros into Nissan for 36.8% of its shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. At the time, Nissan suffered from uneconomical factories (53% utilization), a largely unprofitable lineup, and unproductive workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Ghosn, known as "Le Cost Killer," implemented aggressive measures over the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>:
*   **Portfolio Simplification**: Nissan's complicated portfolio of cross-stock holdings was simplified, as the company held stocks in 1,300 companies due to being part of the *Keiretsu* business family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Supplier Reduction**: The company's supplier network was halved, eliminating inflated prices charged by "family" suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. These efforts yielded at least $2.25 billion in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Incentive Structure Shake-up**: Younger talent was promoted over those with seniority, breaking traditional norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Job Cuts and Factory Closures**: The Nissan revival plan included cutting 21,000 jobs through attrition and closing five factories, a move routine in the US but vexing in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Nissan returned to profitability in 2002, ahead of schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. By 2005, Ghosn became Renault's CEO while retaining his Nissan position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Nissan achieved its 2002 goals by selling a million more cars annually with strong operating margins of 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### Growth Challenges and Unhealthy Strategies
[[carlos_ghosns_impact_on_nissan | Ghosn's]] strategy heavily relied on tapping into the booming Chinese automotive market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. In 2000, Nissan formed a joint venture (JV) called Fengshen Auto with Dongfeng Motor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Despite initial challenges, Dongfeng Nissan's sales grew 160% in 2005, making it the fastest-growing carmaker in China that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

However, Nissan faced significant short-term challenges, including the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, which led to a $2.9 billion net loss in 2009 and thousands of job cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The March 2011 earthquake also damaged factories and disrupted supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

Ghosn correctly foresaw long-term industry shifts, particularly rising R&D costs for safety and environmental regulations, necessitating carmaker consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. He aimed for the Renault-Nissan alliance to compete with VW, Toyota, or GM, targeting 10 million cars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

To achieve these ambitious targets, Nissan employed arguably "unhealthy" strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>:
*   **Deep Discounts**: By 2018, Nissan's incentives averaged 16.7%, higher than the industry's 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Dealer Incentives**: A "stair step" incentive model, dubbed "grow or go," pushed dealers to hit ambitious sales quotas for bonuses, leading to desperation and dealer attrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Increased Fleet Sales**: Selling more cars to rental fleets negatively impacted resale values for other consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

The company's product lineup also stagnated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. While Nissan introduced promising vehicles like the Titan pickup truck (2003) and the Leaf EV, their execution was lacking, leading to missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. For example, the Nissan Leaf and Renault ZOE EVs were developed with almost no shared components, wasting time and momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

### Tensions and Ghosn's Downfall
[[carlos_ghosns_impact_on_nissan | Ghosn]] pushed for closer integration between Renault and Nissan, forcing engineers to collaborate and assigning managers with responsibilities in both companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. This led to cultural and geopolitical tensions within the Alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Nissan perceived the arrangement as uneven, with Renault having voting power over Nissan but not vice versa, and felt they were increasingly propping up Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

Ghosn's long tenure, jet-setting lifestyle, and high compensation (earning $9.6 million in cash and stock in 2010, significantly more than other Japanese executives) became sources of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. His pay disputes, lengthy leadership, and tensions over a forced merger ultimately led to his downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

In November 2018, Ghosn was arrested in Japan, stripped of his positions, and charged with underreporting his income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. He later fled to Lebanon, claiming he was escaping a rigged justice system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

### Post-Ghosn Era and Renault Relationship Reset
[[management_and_strategic_changes_at_nissan_postghosn | Ghosn's abrupt departure]] plunged Nissan into chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. His successor, Hiroto Saikawa, also resigned due to stock pay violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. From 2019 to 2021, Nissan struggled, cutting jobs, closing factories, and resetting incentives and dealer relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

A major focus was resetting the unequal shareholding relationship with Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. The complex deal, sealed in 2023, trimmed Renault's stake in Nissan to 15% and gave Nissan voting rights for its 15% stake in Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. Nissan also agreed to invest in Renault's new EV division, Ampere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. This period also saw Mitsubishi Motors' awkward inclusion in the alliance in 2016 after an emissions scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

Nissan's CEO Makoto Uchida acknowledged past challenges, citing China and the rollout of EVs in the US as major current challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

### Rise of Chinese EVs and Nissan's Decline in China
The rapid rise of Chinese EV companies, fueled by a powerful ecosystem and massive domestic market, significantly impacted global automotive markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Companies like Xiaomi, traditionally known for consumer electronics, entered the EV market aggressively, showcasing advanced products at hyper speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

Old guard joint ventures like Dongfeng Nissan struggled to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. In 2023, Nissan's Chinese sales fell by 30%, with similar declines projected for 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. Utilization at Nissan's seven factories in China is reportedly at 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. China accounts for a third of Nissan's sales, making it their top market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

## Catalyst for the Honda Merger
The news of the Honda-Nissan talks was reportedly initiated when [[acquisition_of_sharp_by_foxconn | Foxconn]], the Taiwanese giant, began exploring the possibility of buying into Nissan through Renault or its trust banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Foxconn has been pursuing the EV industry, aiming to help a client enter the US and global markets, having previously engaged with Lordstown and Fisker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. Despite Foxconn's potential in EV manufacturing (e.g., Luxgen n7 SUV), its track record with running [[acquisition_of_sharp_by_foxconn | Sharp]] has not been ideal, and Nissan is considered a "crown jewel" of Japan Inc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. This external interest reportedly spurred the Japanese government to arrange the tie-up with Honda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

## Honda's Reluctance and Outlook
Honda, however, is not enthusiastic about taking on Nissan's problems, which include an aging product lineup and a lopsided cost structure where Japan accounts for less than 20% of car production but nearly half of the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. At a press conference, Honda's CEO famously responded "That's a difficult one" when asked why Nissan would make a good business partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

Honda has reportedly set a condition for the merger to continue: Nissan must triple its profit by 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. This places the onus on Nissan to save itself, raising questions about the necessity of the merger if Nissan can achieve such a feat independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.

The future of Nissan as an independent entity appears uncertain, whether the merger proceeds or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

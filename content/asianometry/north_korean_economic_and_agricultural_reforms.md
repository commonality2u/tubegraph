The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), or North Korea, has consistently pursued [[north_koreas_agricultural_selfsufficiency_efforts | self-sufficiency]] in food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Reliable information about the country's conditions is scarce, primarily coming from anecdotal evidence or rumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Historical Context and Economic Foundation

Historically, the northern part of Korea was its industrial heartland, while the south served as its breadbasket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. North Korea's geography is largely mountainous, with 80% of its land composed of mountains and uplands, and deep valleys in between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Approximately 15% of the country's land is arable, with most farms located on the west coast where conditions are more favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. The climate presents [[challenges_in_north_korean_agricultural_practices | challenges]], including short cropping seasons, harsh winters, and summers that are short, hot, humid, and rainy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Sixty percent of the DPRK's rain falls between June and September, leaving it vulnerable to droughts and floods, worsened by inadequate infrastructure and deforestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

At its founding, the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) inherited an industrialized society from the Japanese occupation government, despite World War II damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. North Korea held 72% of the peninsula's industrial capacity and over 90% of its hydroelectric capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. The WPK regime seized much of this infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. Land belonging to Korean landlords and Japanese colonialists was seized and redistributed to the peasantry between 1945 and 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. While this could have unlocked agricultural capacity, the Korean War ravaged the peninsula, causing population upheaval and annihilating industrial infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

Following the war, the DPRK sought aid and guidance from China and the Soviet Union, leveraging deteriorating Sino-Soviet relations to extract maximum concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. Domestically, the DPRK modeled its economy after the Soviet Union, creating an orthodox centrally planned economy to suppress markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. The state owned all businesses and provided all jobs, seizing all land to establish cooperative and state farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Farmers could only work on these state-controlled farms, with the state owning and confiscating all food for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

Eternal Leader Kim Il-sung pushed for this collectivization to achieve self-reliance in food production, aligning with the country's Juche ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. This collectivization, criticized even by communist bloc peers, led to food shortages in the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. In response, the government heavily promoted the use of fertilizers, pesticides, tractors, and irrigation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. While yields stabilized, the agricultural sector became dangerously dependent on raw inputs like oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

## Economic Challenges and Early Reforms

Over the years, North Korea accumulated vast debts to its main benefactors, the Soviet Union and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. These unpaid debts led to the Soviets withdrawing various subsidies in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. In the same year, the DPRK instituted a range of new agricultural reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. These reforms included:
*   Doubling down on double cropping and fertilizers to expand total arable land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   Raising forests, reclaiming tidal land, and clearing hillsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

The intention was to compensate for the loss of Soviet aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. However, such intense practices resulted in soil depletion and acidification, and the newly cleared and reclaimed land was marginal at best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. Consequently, food production still fell short of what was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

The collapse of the Soviet Union caused North Korea to lose its main source of coal, oil, and steel, as the Soviets had provided up to two-thirds of their two-way trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. The loss of oil significantly affected fertilizer production and irrigation infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. The DPRK then turned to China, which by 1993, provided 77% of North Korea's fuel and 68% of its food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. However, in 1994, China faced its own grain issues and, becoming disillusioned with its relations, cut back on this trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

## The Great Famine and Initial Responses

In 1994, North Korean radio broadcasts began admitting the existence of hunger while simultaneously denying its seriousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. Studies of North Korean mortality rates imply that certain provinces had begun experiencing famine conditions as early as 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. Rations were delayed or suspended, and in 1994, the government entirely ended food shipments to four provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. By 1995, coercive seizures of grain from farms began, and prison camps were established for those caught foraging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Refugees pouring into China led to horrific media reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

During 1995-1996, the country's four western provinces, where most farms are located, experienced severe flooding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. The North Korean government claimed 5 million people were displaced, over 1 million tons of grain lost, and an estimated $15 billion in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. While the floods were severe, the government likely exaggerated the damage, as food shortages existed long before, and other surveys counted far fewer displaced people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. Exaggerating the damage allowed the government to save face while requesting aid from South Korea or Japan and deflected outside criticism of its regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

[[Role of international aid and markets in North Koreas food security | International food aid]] helped, but not all of it reached those most in need, leading many charitable organizations to withdraw due to disputes and a lack of accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. The exact scale of the famine remains uncertain, with death estimates ranging from 220,000 to 3.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

## Post-Famine Reforms and Current Challenges

Since the 1990s, North Korea's agricultural production has improved due to [[Role of international aid and markets in North Koreas food security | international aid]], favorable weather, and [[Reforms in South Korean business practices | economic reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. However, [[challenges_in_north_korean_agricultural_practices | North Korean farmers]] continue to face numerous crop-growing challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. Information about the current agricultural situation largely comes from international aid programs operating in the country since at least 2011, though this information is subject to North Korean interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

After the famine, the government permitted households to own and cultivate private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. These small gardens, where people grow potatoes, corn, and vegetables, are well-cared for and have significantly improved the country's [[north_koreas_agricultural_selfsufficiency_efforts | food security]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

In 2012, the Kim Jong-un government implemented [[economic_policies_and_challenges_under_communist_rule | economic policy changes]] to devolve more authority to lower levels, allowing workers on collective farms more decision-making power regarding material and investment planning, rather than blindly following party orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. While not as extensive as Deng Xiaoping's reforms in China, this is considered a step forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. However, the extent and impact of these reforms on the ground remain uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

### Deteriorating Soil Quality and Agricultural Practices
One of North Korea's most significant agricultural concerns is its deteriorating soil quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>. Farmers aggressively plow and till their soil and apply large amounts of chemical fertilizers, which has caused the soil to become acidic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. This interferes with the soil's ability to absorb air and water and the plant's ability to take up nutrients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.

North Korean farmers also aggressively double crop, planting multiple crops in the same area or year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. For example, potatoes and barley are double-cropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. Such practices, year after year, have deteriorated the land's capacity to cultivate food, leading to soils with a reddish hue due to a lack of organic matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. In 2011, the average yield for paddy rice was 3.9 tons per hectare, significantly down from 8.0 tons in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.

To preserve soil quality, farmers should rotate in legumes, which improve soil fertility by increasing nitrogen and water retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>. However, North Korean farmers are reluctant to implement legume-based cropping schemes due to the fear of not meeting wheat production goals set by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

### Technology and Infrastructure
The DPRK's farmers have long lacked adequate farming technology, such as tractors suited for the country's smaller and irregularly shaped fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. Even when technology is available, farmers often cannot run or maintain it due to shortages of energy or parts, preventing them from maximizing their efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. A major reason for this is the country's inability to raise funds to purchase these items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>. While North Korean officials blame U.S. trade sanctions, these sanctions predate North Korea's existence and restrictions were eased in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. Furthermore, China and the Soviet Union also scaled back aid due to North Korea's vast unpaid debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.

### Deforestation and its Consequences
Over the past few decades, the North Korean government has intensely tried to expand its overall arable land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. As the best land is already cultivated, these efforts involve cutting down trees on hillsides to create terraces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. During the famine, cultivation was allowed on lands with slopes above 15%, despite their poor soil quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. Satellite imagery shows that one million hectares of land on slopes above 10 degrees have been cleared for growing cereals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>.

Without trees to hold down the soil, big rainstorms easily wash it away, creating rivers of silt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>. This not only damages the soil's growing capacity but also makes floods more dangerous to people and property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:25:00">[14:25:00]</a>. Floods have been noticeably more destructive since the 1980s, coinciding with the start of these deforestation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. Deforestation also affects the population's ability to generate energy, as 77% of the rural population and 28% of the urban population rely on wood for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>.

### Food Distribution and Market Reforms
Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen notes that famines occur not only due to crop failure but also due to collapsed food distribution networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>. During the DPRK's central planning era, the state collected all harvests and distributed food rations to households based on occupation and size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>. During the famine, even when food was available, oil shortages made distribution difficult, leading to the collapse of the old rationing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>. Ordinary North Koreans then resorted to illegal private markets for food access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>. These "black markets" are generally run by women, mostly housewives trying to sustain their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>.

After the famine subsided, the government initially tried to crack down on these markets but eventually formalized them, providing housing, facilities, and even security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. While the government refused to call it market reform, that is essentially what it was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>. Today, defector surveys indicate that most ordinary North Koreans obtain their food from these markets and the private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>.

The government has also attempted to revitalize the old food ration system, but its current extent is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>. Defectors claim they no longer receive rations like before, but the state still takes up to 70% of state farmers' annual harvests for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>. It is speculated that these rations are now primarily directed towards the country's political and economic elites to retain their support of the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>.

## Current Policy and Future Outlook

The North Korean government's budget and resources have vastly depleted over the years, operating with an official budget of approximately $3.3 billion USD (2007 figure) and a nominal 2017 GDP of $30 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>. Kim Jong-un clearly considers the reform and revitalization of the country's agricultural sector a core aspect of his policy, repeatedly emphasizing improved lives through increased food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>. However, his government has been short on concrete policy solutions, often offering vague proposals like a "seed revolution" or reiterating practices like double cropping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.

While food distribution has improved and famine is no longer a major threat, the situation still falls short of [[north_koreas_agricultural_selfsufficiency_efforts | self-sufficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. The country's farms have suffered significant abuse and soil damage over the decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>, and current proposals are unlikely to address the fundamental agricultural situation needed for sustained food security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>.

Sony's journey to develop a color television set was fraught with [[challenges_of_working_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | engineering difficulties]], particularly with its early pursuit of the Chromatron technology. The Chromatron was invented in 1951 by Nobel laureate Dr. Ernest Lawrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

## Initial Interest and High Hopes
Sony co-founders Masaru Ibuka and Akio Morita discovered the Chromatron at an IEEE-sponsored trade show in New York in 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. Morita was deeply impressed by its sharpest and brightest color screen he had ever seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>, immediately securing a technical license from Paramount Pictures, the technology's owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

However, a young Japanese physicist, Senri Miyaoka, sent to learn the technology, found a team of 10 "glum, very frustrated Americans" in a dark, windowless basement lab, with one even thanking him for "releasing them from such a thankless task" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. Miyaoka sensed Sony had involved itself in something formidable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.

## The Chromatron's Complex Mechanism
The Chromatron aimed to improve upon the RCA Shadow Mask Tube by using a single electron gun instead of three, which eliminated the need for complex convergence alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. Its screen phosphors were arranged in parallel, vertical stripes of green, blue, and red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. To ensure the correct color information hit the right phosphor stripe, it utilized a "grill" of up to 400 charged wires running vertically just inside the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. These "color-selecting wires" activated at precise times to deflect unwanted electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>.

## Manufacturing Challenges and Low Yield
Despite a new factory in Tokyo dedicated to its production, mass production of the Chromatron proved incredibly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>. Key [[challenges_of_working_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenges]] included:
*   **Synchronization Issues**: A major hurdle was synchronizing the electron beam with the activation and deactivation of the numerous metal lines in the grill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. When this synchronization failed, it resulted in "sickening color variations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.
*   **Extreme Complexity**: The Chromatron prototype, with its 27 vacuum tubes and delicate wires spaced less than a millimeter apart, was ten times more complicated to produce than a standard shadow mask tube color TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.
*   **Abysmal Yield Rates**: For every 1,000 TV sets Sony produced, only two or three worked as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>. Even minor grid movements could cause significant misalignment, making people's faces appear green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.
*   **Unsustainable Costs**: In May 1965, Sony released a 19-inch Chromatron to the Japanese market, selling 13,000 sets. However, each set sold for 198,000 yen ($550) but cost an exorbitant 400,000 yen ($1,111) to manufacture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:00">[15:44:00]</a>. The numerous defects forced Sony to offer a lifetime warranty, which was heavily utilized by buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. Annually, Sony spent $700,000 on development costs just to fix issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a>.

## Internal Conflict and Search for an Alternative
Despite the severe losses and defects, Ibuka steadfastly refused to abandon the Chromatron, making it Sony's highest priority with 150 people on the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>. This stance caused palpable tension with Morita, who wished to cut their losses, though he secretly secured a $2 million loan to continue funding the R&D effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>.

In 1965, the team concluded that Dr. Lawrence's original 1-gun method for the Chromatron was too costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>. They switched to a three-gun method (one for each color), which reintroduced gun alignment issues but eased tolerances for the vertical wires, making manufacturing slightly easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>.

By 1966, Ibuka agreed to dissolve the Chromatron team and adopt the Shadow Mask Tube if a viable alternative wasn't discovered by year-end, personally leading the renewed effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>. This intense, final push ultimately led to the development of the Trinitron, which incorporated elements from the Chromatron's grill with a new electron gun inspired by General Electric's "three in a line" cathode arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>.

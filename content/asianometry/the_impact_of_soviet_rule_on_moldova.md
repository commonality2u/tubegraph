Moldova, a small country in Eastern Europe and one of its poorest, has a [[moldovas_complicated_historical_context | long and complicated history]] that significantly shaped its post-Soviet trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The legacy of Soviet rule profoundly impacted its identity, economy, and governance, contributing to its current state of [[moldovas_political_and_economic_corruption | immense corruption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Establishment of the Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic

The modern Republic of Moldova can be traced back to the principality of Moldova, founded in the 14th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. A significant portion of this principality, Basarabia, was ceded to the Russian Empire in 1812 by the Ottoman Empire following the Russo-Turkish War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. After the Russian Revolution, these Moldovan lands initially declared independence and joined Romania as "Greater Romania," a union the Soviet Union never recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

In June 1940, following a non-aggression pact with Germany, the Soviets demanded and acquired Bessarabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This led to the founding of the Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), the Soviet Union's second smallest republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Joseph Stalin aggressively persecuted those exposed to non-communist systems, subsequently purging the country by deporting and executing thousands as part of an "ideological cleansing process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. When the Soviets retook control in 1944 after Romania's temporary re-invasion, the land was devastated by war, mass famine, collectivization, and another wave of deportations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Economic and Social Structure Under Soviet Rule

The Moldovan SSR's top leadership was dominated by ethnic Russians and Ukrainians, with ethnic Moldovans rarely reaching higher positions of power, unless they were from the Transnistria region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This region, fully integrated into Russian culture and with a population of about 50% Russians and Ukrainians, was the Moldovan SSR's most industrialized area, producing 90% of the area's power despite only making up 12% of its land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

During the Soviet years, Moldova was a significant agricultural producer, accounting for 30% of the world's tobacco and 20% of its total grape harvest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Post-Soviet Transition and Lingering Challenges

In the late 1980s, tensions between the ethnic Moldovan majority and the Soviets led to strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The Popular Front, a diverse opposition movement, emerged, advocating for Romanian reunification, state sovereignty, or communist reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. A massive rally in late 1989 drew 500,000 people demanding full sovereignty and Soviet troop withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. In 1990, the Popular Front won most seats in the Moldovan Supreme Soviet, breaking the Communist Party's monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The Moldovan SSR renamed itself the Republic of Moldova in May 1991 and declared independence from the collapsing [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] in August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

The years spent under Soviet rule left Moldova ethnically divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. This division, combined with the "years of Soviet oppression and rule," cultivated strong anti-Russian sentiments among some, while others still supported closer relations with Russia, particularly the Transnistrians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. The nation struggled with its new identity, leading to political cleavages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Economic Struggles Post-Independence

Moldova's transition from a Soviet republic involved a wholesale remaking of its identity, economy, and government simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The ailing economy collapsed rapidly, shrinking by an average of 7% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The country experienced hyperinflation, with a monthly inflation rate of 75% in the first six months of 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. By the end of 1992, 79% of Moldovans fell into poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This problem was compounded by the de facto independence of Transnistria, Moldova's most industrialized area, which was now out of reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. These [[moldovas_economic_struggles_postsoviet_union | economic policies and challenges under Communist rule]] also caused major economic hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

The government attempted "shock therapy" by transitioning to a market economy, liberalizing trade, and privatizing state property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. However, many [[economic_policies_and_challenges_under_communist_rule | economic relief efforts came years too late]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. The privatization schemes were botched: company managers exploited inside knowledge to buy shares at low prices or pilfer assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Agricultural land distribution, though statistically high, was similarly flawed, with plots distributed late, without consideration for quality, and often taken advantage of by "smart people in the know" who assembled massive fertile parcels, much like the old collective farms but now privately owned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## Rise of Oligarchic Control

The failed privatization schemes enriched a select group of connected individuals, creating a class of [[oligarchic_control_and_influence_in_moldova | oligarchs]] while citizens remained poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. By 1997, Moldova's GDP had fallen to 35% of what it was a decade earlier, and over 50% of the population lived in poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. The black market contributed 70% of the country's livelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. By 2005, 20% of the population had emigrated, with personal remittances becoming one of Moldova's biggest income sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

The Communist Party, playing on nostalgia for "the good old Soviet days" and promising free healthcare and closer ties with Russia, surged back to power in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. They consolidated rule using their strong organizational base inherited from Soviet experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. The 2000s became a decade of theft and corruption as politicians infiltrated the economy, transferring public assets to private hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. This period saw the rise of powerful figures like Vladimir Plahotniuc, who leveraged his wealth and influence to dominate politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, illustrating the transition from politicians enriching businessmen to businessmen becoming politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

Moldova continues to deal with significant challenges, including ongoing poverty and corruption, largely stemming from the poorly executed policies and deeply entrenched issues that originated during and after the Soviet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

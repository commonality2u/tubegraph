Concerns have been raised in Taiwan about America's intentions regarding TSMC, with some suggesting the U.S. is attempting to "steal" the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This talking point gained prominence following local elections in Taiwan and the impending start of operations at [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC's Arizona facility]] in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Development and Initial Plans

[[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC]] announced its plans for a new production facility in Arizona in May 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Initially, there was skepticism, with some drawing comparisons to the Foxconn plant in Wisconsin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

The original plan for the Arizona facility was to produce N5 chips, which represented the most advanced node [[TSMC's technological advancements | TSMC]] had attempted to bring outside of Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. People in Taiwan initially found comfort in two aspects of this plan:
*   **Small Scale** The Arizona site was comparatively small, designed to produce around 20,000 300-millimeter wafers per month. This contrasted sharply with Taiwan's four gigafabs, which could collectively produce over 100,000 wafers per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Technological Lag** It was presumed that by the time the Arizona factory came online in 2024, the N5 node would no longer be the leading edge, as N3, the next full node step, was expected to be fully operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Updated Announcements and Expansion

Shortly before its "tool-in" ceremony in December 2022, [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC]] made several significant announcements:
*   **N4 Process Introduction** [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC]] revealed plans to bring its N4 process to Arizona, an upgrade on the existing N5 line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Second Arizona Factory** The company committed an additional $28 billion investment over three years to open a second Arizona factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This second fab will be equipped with N3, which is expected to enter high-volume production by 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Commitment to Taiwan's Leading Edge** Despite these expansions, [[TSMC's technological advancements | TSMC]] remains committed to retaining its most advanced nodes, such as [[tsmcs_n2_process_node_and_new_fab_locations | N2]] and N1, in Taiwan. [[tsmcs_n2_process_node_and_new_fab_locations | N2]] fabs are planned to be in production by 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Global Expansion** Beyond Arizona, [[tsmcs_global_expansion_strategy | TSMC]] is expanding its presence internationally. A specialty n28 plant is under construction in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan, and discussions are ongoing for a potential plant in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

These new developments represent a shift from [[TSMC's global expansion strategy | TSMC's]] long-standing norm, championed by leaders like Morris Chang, of concentrating its most advanced operations in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This has understandably caused nervousness in Taiwan, leading to anxieties that can be capitalized on by slogans like "stealing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Drivers of U.S. Expansion

The move to expand in the U.S. is driven by a confluence of demand and financing:
*   **Customer Demand** [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC]] operates as a commercial entity in close communication with its customers, primarily Apple, which accounts for approximately 25% of its total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Apple has been instrumental in funding advanced chip rollouts and was key to [[Impact on TSMC and Samsung | TSMC's]] ascent after defecting from Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed their decision to source from the Arizona plant starting in 2024, and potentially from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC]] must follow customer demand, especially to avoid losing Apple to competitors like Samsung or Intel, which are also building massive new facilities in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Government Subsidies** The U.S. CHIPS Act of 2022 set aside $50 billion in subsidies for semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Strategically, [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC]] benefits from these subsidies, as it also reduces funding available to competitors like Intel and Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Rebuttal of "Stealing" Claims

The notion that America is "stealing" [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC]] or much of Taiwan's manufacturing, causing "massive loss" to the Taiwanese economy, is challenged by a review of scale and strategic factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Technology Transfer
Genuine technology transfer situations typically involve joint ventures or specific requirements for indigenous production and knowledge transfer. None of these conditions are present with [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC's]] Arizona plant; [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC]] maintains outright ownership of its fabs, consistent with its model, with the sole exception of a previous Singapore fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Capital Expenditure and Wafer Shipments
Claims of a "massive loss" are not supported by the numbers:
*   **Capital Expenditure** [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC]]'s capital expenditure for 2022 was about $36 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The $28 billion investment in the second Arizona fab, spread over three years (approximately $9 billion per year), represents only 25-30% of [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC]]'s proposed annual capital expenditure. The majority of the company's spending will remain in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Wafer Shipments** In 2021, [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC]] produced and shipped 14.2 million 300-millimeter equivalent wafers, projected to be 15-16 million in 2022 (around 1.3 million per month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. A significant portion (75-85%) of these wafers are produced in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. When the first Arizona fab starts production in 2024, it will produce around 20,000 wafers per month, which is less than 1/50th of current annual production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Even with planned expansion to 50,000 wafers per month by 2026, it would require five to ten times more investment than currently planned to make a substantial dent in Taiwan's share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Continued Investment in Taiwan
Despite the focus on the Arizona facility, [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC]] is simultaneously managing at least five other major build-outs in Taiwan. This includes new phases to existing fabs, expansions in Tainan, and work on new [[tsmcs_n2_process_node_and_new_fab_locations | N2]] plants in Baoshan and potentially Taichung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. There are also future plans for an N1 plant in Longtan District <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Additionally, the Kaohsiung Fab is moving forward with an n28 build, despite adjustments to its N7 capacity due to market weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Taiwan remains [[Impact of TSMC's expansion on Taiwan | TSMC's]] greatest asset, and the company has no choice but to go "all in" on Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Limitations of U.S. Self-Sufficiency

The assumption that [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC's]] Arizona fab makes America self-sufficient in silicon is problematic for several reasons:
*   **Dominance of Legacy Chips** The majority of the world's industrially important semiconductors (used in fridges, airplanes, cars) are not leading-edge N4 and N3 chips. These are typically 130 nanometer, 65 nanometer, and n28 chips, which constitute the majority of [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC's]] volume but a minority of its revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Other Taiwanese Foundries** Taiwan is home to other significant semiconductor foundries like UMC (third largest), Powerchip (seventh), and Vanguard (eighth), which possess specialty processes not duplicated elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Packaging and Assembly** Taiwan holds leading positions in other parts of the chip supply chain, including wafers, packaging, assembly, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. The U.S. has a weaker position in global packaging, assembly, and test capacity (3% market share) compared to fabrication (10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Taiwan hosts three of the world's five largest outsourced semiconductor packaging, assembly, and testing (OSAT) companies, including the largest, ASE Group, along with SPIL and Powertech Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. There are no plans or government funding for conventional packaging in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Duplicating this entire global supply chain would be economically challenging, if not impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Human Capital** The majority of managers running [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC's]] fabs, including thousands of critical personnel in R&D, operations, and supply chain management, are based in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Taiwan's leadership in semiconductor manufacturing, electronics assembly, and specialty plastics is the result of billions of dollars and 50 years of industrial development, which cannot be replicated quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

The U.S. establishing a fab in Arizona does not make it self-sufficient in silicon, nor does it remove Taiwan's central role in the global semiconductor supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. The China-Taiwan scenario presents a systemic risk that extends beyond a few companies in the sector and cannot be easily hedged against in the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

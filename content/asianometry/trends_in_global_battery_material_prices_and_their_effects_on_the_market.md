In 2024, lithium-ion battery pack prices experienced their most significant price cut since 2017, falling 20% to $115 per kilowatt-hour, making Chinese batteries cheaper even with high tariffs [00:00:02]. This trend is largely driven by price and technology developments in Lithium Ion Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries [00:00:24].

## Battery Chemistries and Material Costs
Lithium-ion batteries consist of two electrodes: a cathode and an anode, with the anode typically being graphite [00:00:53]. The cathode is the most expensive component, accounting for over 70% of a battery's value, and is used to distinguish between different battery chemistries [00:01:03].

There are three major battery chemistries in the industry:
*   **Ternary Batteries**: These include Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) and Nickel Cobalt Aluminum (NCA) [00:01:10]. Their cathodes mix three materials [00:01:15].
    *   **Advantages**: Higher energy densities, allowing for lighter battery packs and longer EV ranges [00:01:28]. NCA ranges from 230 to 260 watt-hours per kilogram, and NMC is the highest at 250 to 320 watt-hours per kilogram [00:02:30].
    *   **Disadvantages**: Rely on rarer and more expensive materials like nickel and cobalt, which constitute a significant portion of the battery's cost (70% for raw materials) [00:01:41]. Their higher energy densities also increase thermal risks, potentially leading to thermal runaway (fire) [00:01:53].
*   **LFP Batteries**: These use a dual-chemistry cathode made from iron phosphate, notably without cobalt or nickel [00:02:02].
    *   **Advantages**: Hold a substantial cost advantage due to the use of more common materials like iron and phosphorus [00:02:12]. They also maintain their initial energy capacity better over many charge and discharge cycles [00:02:19]. The lower energy density also reduces the risks of thermal runaway [00:02:57].
    *   **Disadvantages**: Historically suffered from lower energy densities, approximately 90 to 160 watt-hours per kilogram [00:02:26]. This means LFP-powered EVs traditionally had shorter ranges [00:02:51].

Generally, LFPs prioritize cost and safety, while NMC and NCA prioritize performance [00:03:04]. For more details, see [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | Comparative analysis of different battery chemistries]].

## Evolution of Battery Material Choices
Early lithium-ion batteries, known as Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCOs), used a significant amount of cobalt (0.95 kg per kilogram-hour of energy capacity) [00:03:21]. However, relying on this much cobalt, primarily sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo, proved economically, morally, and environmentally unsustainable as lithium-ion batteries gained popularity [00:03:35].

This led to the traction of ternary battery chemistries like NCA, NMC, and Lithium Manganese Oxide (LMO), which used far less cobalt (e.g., 0.14 kg for NCA and 0.4 kg for NMC) [00:03:48]. In the 2010s, pioneering Western EVs like the Chevrolet Volt, Nissan Leaf, and Tesla Model S utilized ternary cathode chemistries [00:04:09].

Meanwhile, Chinese EV makers initially adopted LFPs, particularly for buses, influenced by early government industrial policies such as the "Thousands of Vehicles, Tens of Cities" (TVTC) policy, launched in 2009 [00:04:22]. This policy provided subsidies to municipal governments to purchase public service fleets like buses and taxis, aiming to address urban air pollution, energy security, and promote Chinese EVs [00:04:37]. Companies like BYD became early pioneers in LFP technology due to cost and safety advantages, leading to LFP dominance in the Chinese EV industry for several years [00:04:56].

## Impact of Policy Shifts on Market Share
In late 2016, the Chinese government shifted its subsidy policies to encourage the production of EVs more attractive to consumers [00:05:12]. Subsidies became linked to factors like higher energy density, longer driving ranges, and faster charging rates [00:05:22]. This policy favored ternary battery chemistries, which could achieve higher energy densities and unlock larger subsidies, leading to their market share reaching about 70% by mid-2019, while LFP's share fell to 30% or lower [00:05:38]. Even long-time LFP adopters like BYD temporarily switched to ternary batteries for some models [00:05:45].

However, this trend reversed starting in June 2019 when the Chinese government began to gradually withdraw these EV cash subsidies [00:06:12]. This aggressive sunsetting, including a 50% reduction in mid-2019, leveled the cost playing field [00:07:03]. As a result, EV makers rushed back to LFP, and LFP manufacturers rolled out new technologies to address fundamental weaknesses [00:07:10].

## [[technological_innovations_in_lfp_battery_production | Technological innovations in LFP battery production]]
One significant innovation was BYD's Blade battery, introduced in March 2020 [00:07:43]. Traditionally, EV batteries are manufactured in three levels: cells, modules, and packs [00:07:54]. The Blade battery bypassed the module level entirely, sliding prismatic cells directly into the battery pack, a concept known as Cell-to-Pack (CTP) [00:08:43]. This maximized the pack's volume to compensate for LFP's lower energy density [00:08:57].

The prismatic cells were re-engineered into a long, ultra-thin shape, spanning the width of the battery pack, hence the name "Blade" [00:09:23]. This innovation significantly improved LFP performance, with the BYD Han EV achieving a range of 605 kilometers (NEDC) using LFP, comparable to premium ternary-powered EVs at a lower cost [00:09:35]. CTP technology gives LFP battery packs about 85% of the energy density of conventional NMC batteries, and ternary batteries have difficulty adopting CTP due to higher temperatures [00:10:26]. Other Chinese battery makers like CATL also adopted CTP technology [00:10:41]. By 2021, LFP battery volumes surpassed NMC, accounting for nearly 70% of EV installations by 2023 [00:10:55]. NMC batteries are now primarily used for premium, high-performance vehicles [00:11:10].

Further [[technological_innovations_in_lfp_battery_production | technological innovations in LFP battery production]] include:
*   **LMFP (Lithium Manganese Iron Phosphate)**: Adding manganese to LFP increases energy density [00:14:21].
*   **"Double Firing" (二烧) Process**: This new production method involves partially firing precursors at a lower temperature, then milling and carbon coating them before a second firing [00:15:02]. This results in more uniform and similarly sized particles, leading to better, more consistent performance ideal for long-range, fast-charging EVs [00:15:14].

## Patent Expiration and Market Dynamics
A "patent shield" deal in the 2000s or 2010s allowed Chinese battery makers to use LFP battery patents for free within their local markets, while others had to pay licensing fees [00:12:15]. This enabled China to build expertise in LFP, while the rest of the world pursued non-LFP structures [00:12:32].

These key LFP patents, pioneered by researchers in Canada and Europe (based on Dr. John Goodenough's initial LFP cathode invention), expired in 2022 [00:11:26]. While this opened LFP chemistry to foreign battery makers without licensing fees, Chinese manufacturers had already established immense LFP supply chain proficiency, including CTP innovations, economies of scale, materials sourcing, and talent pipelines [00:12:48].

## Competition and Price Wars
Until 2021, BYD practiced vertical integration, only using its batteries in its own cars [00:13:20]. However, in 2021, BYD began selling its Blade batteries to third parties like Toyota and Ford, introducing a major new Tier 1 battery supplier and triggering a price war [00:13:39]. This intensified the already competitive Chinese EV market, where a new EV model is reportedly launched every two days [00:13:54]. This intense competition further drives LFP makers to seek new production methods and chemistries to differentiate their products [00:14:07].

## [[raw_material_availability_and_costs_of_sodiumion_batteries | Raw material availability and costs of sodiumion batteries]]
A significant factor in the lithium-ion battery price crash post-2022 was a concurrent crash in raw material prices [00:15:27]. Raw materials account for 70-80% of a battery cell's cost [00:15:36]. For LFP, iron phosphate and lithium alone represent 80% of the material cost [00:15:43].

*   **Lithium**: New lithium sources came online in Australia, Chile, and Argentina in 2023, reversing a prior shortage and causing prices to crash [00:15:50]. Chinese operators are injecting cash into some mines to keep them open despite losses, for political and technical reasons [00:16:06].
*   **Iron Ore**: Iron prices reversed from their 2022 highs due to China's real estate crisis, which has mothballed crude steel production, leading to a 15% fall in iron ore prices in 2024 alone [00:16:15].

These plummeting raw material costs have enabled Chinese EV battery makers to cut battery prices while maintaining profitability, with CATL's gross profit margins rising from 19.2% to 24.4% despite declining revenues [00:16:33].

## Spillover Effects on Utility-Scale Storage
The crashing prices of LFP batteries have also had significant effects on industries beyond EVs [00:17:11]. LFP batteries were already favored for Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) due to their lower material costs and resistance to thermal runaway [00:18:33].

The Chinese EV boom in 2021 further fueled the adoption of BESS for utility-scale stationary energy storage systems [00:18:44]. While BESS currently provide 1-2 hours of power compared to the 4-12 hours of pumped storage, they are incredibly cheap and simple to build, often housed within standard-sized containers [00:18:53]. This has made BESS largely uncompetitive with other energy storage schemes, such as "power to gas" (converting electricity to methane) [00:18:24]. Billions of dollars are being invested in BESS projects in the United States, particularly in California and Texas [00:19:17].

## Future Outlook
Market analysts predict LFP prices will continue to fall, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years [00:19:44]. An interesting future development to watch is the technological progress of sodium-ion batteries, which are being pursued by companies like CATL, BYD, and Huawei [00:19:52]. While sodium-ion batteries currently suffer fundamental energy density shortcomings compared to lithium-ion, sodium is far more accessible than lithium, charges faster, and energy density numbers are improving [00:20:10]. The extent of their market impact remains to be seen, given the highly optimized LFP supply chain [00:20:23].

South Korea's economy is largely shaped by massive business groups known as [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]], including names like Samsung, Hyundai, and LG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While these groups are a significant economic strength, powering the export economy and dominating daily life, they have also historically manipulated the Korean economy and maintained corrupt ties with high levels of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Pre-Crisis Environment: Crony Capitalism and Debt Accumulation

The [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | history of corruption]] in Korea predates the modern state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The early South Korean government, under President Syngman Rhee, recreated the [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]] by selling seized Japanese state assets and other state-owned entities through private negotiations rather than public auctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Under Park Chung-hee's military coup in 1961, a [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | crony capitalism]] deal was struck with the [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]] supported Park's industrialization policies, and in return, the government provided foreign currency loans at below-market interest rates to acquire foreign technologies and build capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. These loans often came with kickbacks for political campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This system ensured that "the best way to acquire cheap capital and get rich was to be good friends with the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The government granted the [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]] privileges and shielded them from their excesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. For example, in 1971, when the [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]] were over-leveraged, the Korean government converted their private market loans to five-year public ones and froze private interest rates, effectively bailing them out at the expense of small lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

By the mid-1980s, the [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]] had become dominant, accounting for nearly 20% of the country's GDP and 45% of its mining/manufacturing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This strategy suffocated the country's small and medium-sized business sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

After South Korea democratized in 1987, the [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]] gained substantial political power due to weak political parties and a lack of above-board campaign financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This allowed them to influence legislation, such as Daewoo Group's successful lobbying in 1988 to amend the law to permit the government bailout of its ailing shipbuilding corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. They pushed for rapid liberalization reforms, which included easier access to foreign capital financing, leading to a massive debt boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Another reform allowed them to take limited ownership stakes in non-bank financial companies, encouraging complicated cross-ownership structures that obscured their true size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This led to profitable companies propping up weaker ones, resulting in market inefficiencies and oversupply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## The [[impact_of_the_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | Asian Financial Crisis of 1997]]

The culmination of these practices came in 1997 with the [[impact_of_the_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | Asian Financial Crisis]], which vastly pared back the power of the [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This crisis opened the door for reforms aimed at encouraging "common prosperity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### Post-Crisis Reforms and Their Impact

The Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun administrations imposed a variety of reforms on the ailing [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The primary goals were to prevent future financial crises by limiting debt capacity and cross-shareholder structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

These reforms had significant consequences:
*   **Debt Reduction:** Companies like Hanjin Shipping were forced to reduce their debt-to-equity loads below 200%, leading to the sale of ships and increased leasing to retain capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Industry Consolidation:** The Korean car industry, which had five independent companies in 1997, consolidated to just one, Hyundai, soon after the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Affiliate Reduction:** A sample of [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]] showed a reduction in affiliates from 819 in 1997 to 544 three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Increased Shareholder Dividends:** Dividends to minority shareholders, who were often stiffed by cross-holding structures, increased from 2.2 trillion won in 2001 to 10.8 trillion by 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Export Juggernaut Creation:** The "unfriendly domestic environment" post-crisis prompted the largest [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]] to seize on free trade agreements and turn outwards, leading to massive export success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. By 2013, 86% of Samsung's revenue came from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This success drove Korea's top-line economic recovery, with an average growth rate of 5% from 1998 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Social Consequences and Continued Inequality

Despite the economic growth, the benefits were not widely distributed, leading to a significant gap between the "haves and have-nots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. In 2013, [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]] brought in over 50% of revenue and value-add in manufacturing but employed less than 20% of the sector's employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

As part of the post-1997 reforms, the government allowed [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]] to make it easier to lay people off in exchange for becoming more profitable and servicing their debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This resulted in hundreds of thousands losing their jobs, with many struggling to find regular salaried work since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Elder poverty in Korea subsequently reached four times the OECD average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The income share for the top 1% of Korean society rose from 7% before 1997 to 12% in the mid-2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This growing inequality led the public to disapprove of the outsized power of these big business groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> and vote for a change of direction in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## Post-Crisis Political Responses

President Lee Myung-bak, a former businessman and CEO of Hyundai Construction, campaigned in 2007 on economic recovery, promising to raise GDP growth, achieve a higher per capita income, and make Korea the seventh-largest economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. His policies aimed to unleash the [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]]'s ability to compete globally, viewing big business as "too small for the world" rather than too big for Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. He lowered corporate tax rates, raised investment ceilings for non-bank financials, and amnestied executives convicted in the wake of the [[impact_of_the_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | financial crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. However, his administration failed to deliver the promised growth, and GDP growth continued to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Lee was later arrested on charges of bribery, embezzlement, and tax fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

His successor, Park Geun-hye, while conservative, moved leftwards on messaging, combining nostalgia for past glory years with an emphasis on welfare, though she did not advocate for a higher capital gains tax, a key factor in the accelerating wealth gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Her administration also ended in corruption scandals and impeachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

## Ongoing Challenges

Modern corruption by the [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]] often focuses on maintaining control of their empires through tax manipulations and legislative/regulatory capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. The consequences of ignored regulations due to this close relationship were tragically demonstrated by the Sewol sinking in 2014, which claimed 304 lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The regulatory agency and the ferry company had worked closely to ignore violations, maintaining a profitable status quo that included the rotation of government employees into the industry and the company's monopoly privilege <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

President Moon Jae-in, Park Geun-hye's successor, responded with business reforms and higher tax rates, leading to some improvement in public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. However, the South Korean economy remains highly dependent on its handful of powerful global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Substantial reform risks weakening their global competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | Chaebol]] reform continues to be a hotly debated issue in South Korean politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

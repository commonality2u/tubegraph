International Computers Limited (ICL) was established in 1968 through a British government-arranged merger of three computer manufacturers, envisioned as the United Kingdom's answer to IBM and a national champion in computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite pioneering computing technology, ICL ultimately failed to compete effectively against American and East Asian rivals, eventually being sold to Fujitsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Origins in Punch Card Technology

Both IBM and ICL's predecessor, British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM), traced their roots back to Herman Hollerith's electromechanical tabulating machine for punched cards, invented in the 1880s for the 1890 U.S. census <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

*   **IBM's Formation**: Hollerith started the Tabulating Machine Company of New York (TMC) to sell his machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. TMC was later sold to Computing Tabulating Recording Company (CTR), which in 1924, renamed itself to International Business Machines (IBM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. IBM's early machines used punched cards for data input, output, and storage, performing basic mathematical operations like multiplication and division by the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **BTM's Licensing Agreement**: In 1907, Hollerith's British friends, R. P. Porter and Sir Raleigh Philpotts, founded BTM, securing an exclusive license to Hollerith's punch card technology throughout the British Empire (excluding Canada) in exchange for 25% of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This license was later inherited by IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Early Competition in the Punch Card Market

IBM and BTM initially aligned against a common rival, Power Samas, a French-American conglomerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

*   **Market Share Disparity**: Despite BTM having access to IBM's products, R&D, and manufacturing, it struggled to match IBM's sales prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. IBM's American sales territory, while only twice as large as BTM's, generated 20 times the revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. IBM dominated the US market with 90% share, but the British Empire market was evenly split between Power Samas and BTM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Blame and Strain**: IBM executive Thomas Watson attributed BTM's underperformance to "sales incompetence," describing their selling style as "low-key and typically British" where "business came after fishing, hunting and shooting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. BTM, conversely, blamed the "onerous 25% royalty rate" as a "millstone around their neck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The relationship between the two companies' leaders was strained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Post-War Transition to Electronic Computing

World War II accelerated the development of electronics and the stored program computer, marking the eventual obsolescence of the punch card industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Initially, both IBM and BTM viewed computers as expensive, niche devices, taking a cautious "evolution not revolution" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

*   **IBM's Gradual Electronic Entry**: IBM's first electronic calculator, the IBM 603 Electronic Multiplier, was announced in September 1946 and sold hundreds of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. In 1948, the IBM 604 Electronic Calculating Punch offered limited programming steps and sold "extremely well," with over 400 still in use by 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **BTM and IBM Part Ways**: In 1949, IBM and BTM mutually dissolved their sales agreement, entering open competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. BTM lost access to IBM's product lineup and R&D but eliminated the 25% royalty, which tripled their operating profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Despite IBM's significantly larger revenue (USD 400 million vs. BTM's GBP 5 million in 1949), BTM was "a little delusional" but also unaware of the impending computer revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The half-century long license agreement had kept IBM out of British territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Lord Halsbury's Prediction**: Lord Halsbury, general manager of the newly founded National Research Development Corporation (NRDC), visited IBM in 1949 and became convinced that IBM would soon dominate electronic data processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. He predicted that punch cards would be in a museum within 10 years and correctly believed the British computing industry could not compete with IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## IBM's Market Dominance and ICL's Struggle

*   **IBM 650**: In 1955, IBM introduced the IBM 650, the "world's first mass-produced computer," which was very popular and the first to turn a profit in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. However, IBM shipped only two such computers to the British Isles throughout the 1950s, leaving a "massive door open for a domestic player" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **BTM's Hesitation**: Despite developing its own computer (Hollerith Electric Computer or HEC-1) with the University of London, BTM showed little interest in the computing space throughout the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Even with the HEC-4 in 1956, 90% of BTM's revenue still came from profitable punch card machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **ICT and the IBM 1401**: In 1959, BTM merged with Power Samas to form International Computers and Tabulators Limited (ICT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. However, in 1956, IBM introduced the IBM 1401, which replaced vacuum tubes with transistors, making it "cheaper, faster, and more reliable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. The 1401, with its ecosystem of hardware and software, directly targeted the punch card industry's core use cases and sold over 10,000 installations, becoming IBM's most important product by 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. The 1401's transistor hardware "obsoleted every computer that dared to use vacuum tubes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   **The "Software Crisis" and IBM System/360**: As hardware upgraded rapidly, new software had to be written, leading to a "software crisis" where software costs sometimes surpassed hardware costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. IBM invested $500 million to develop the System/360, a range of computers offering a single, scalable architecture that allowed customers to upgrade hardware without rewriting software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. This "third generation" system "caught the entire industry by surprise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.
*   **British Responses**: ICT's roadmap for a family of computers was for 1968, but they quickly reworked the Ferranti Packard 6000 into the ICT 1900 series, taking advantage of IBM production delays in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. English Electric licensed RCA's IBM System/360 compatible architecture, releasing System 4 in 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. The UK government, concerned about a widening "technology gap" with America and foreign influence, sought to consolidate the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

## ICL's Formation and Decline

*   **The "Shotgun Marriage"**: MinTech, a new Ministry of Technology, focused on the British computer industry, seeking to merge ICT and English Electric to create a national champion capable of competing with IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Despite initial reluctance, the companies agreed to a merger in 1967, finalized in July 1968, creating ICL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. ICL became the "world's largest non-American computer manufacturer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
*   **Mainframe Focus and Missed Opportunities**: ICL inherited two incompatible mainframe product families: the 1900 series from ICT and System 4 from English Electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. Political pressure kept ICL focused on mainframes, ironically hastening its marginalization as it "completely miss[ed] out on the minicomputer boom of the 1990s," which "would overtake the IBM giant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.
*   **Rising R&D Costs**: ICL faced skyrocketing R&D costs, particularly for writing new software for each new architecture and the tightening cycles of semiconductor production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. ICL's technology, once only three years behind IBM, found itself caught in the crossfire of IBM's aggressive response to Fujitsu, with IBM's 4300 series offering "four times improvement in cost performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. ICL's annual R&D spend would need to nearly triple by 1983 to maintain competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.
*   **Partnership with Fujitsu**: In search of a partner for advanced semiconductor technology to reduce its R&D burden, ICL found Fujitsu, who offered significantly more advanced logic gates (8,000 vs. IBM's 1,000 and American firms' 3,000) and a five-year technology roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. A technology transfer deal in 1981 led ICL to sell Fujitsu's IBM-compatible mainframes while gaining access to their semiconductor technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. This partnership effectively ended ICL's hopes of being a "national champion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.
*   **IBM's Diversification and ICL's Fate**: IBM's release of the home computer in 1981 further transformed the market, making the mainframe market a "dinosaur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>. ICL closed manufacturing plants, cut R&D, and focused on sales and systems integration, becoming an "assembler and distributor" of other companies' components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. In 1990, Fujitsu acquired ICL, eventually shutting down the brand in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>.

## Conclusion: Key Lessons from the Comparison

The downfall of ICL in comparison to IBM illustrates several trends:

*   **Lack of Technical Primacy**: ICL consistently lagged behind IBM and Japanese giants in technology, failing to gain business leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.
*   **Industry Splintering**: While IBM initially aimed to be a massive vertically integrated combine, the market's competitive intensity and sheer size led to its splintering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. Specialized companies, like software firms (e.g., Microsoft), raised the stakes, making it impossible for combines like ICL or even IBM to keep up in all sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.
*   **Hollowness of National Prestige**: ICL and its political sponsors aimed to beat IBM in its strongest area – big, bulky mainframe computers – investing heavily to emulate IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. However, ICL could not muster the same resources and ultimately faced the same market circumstances that led to IBM's decline in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>.

The hydrogen bomb, also known as a staged thermonuclear weapon, possesses immense destructive capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The United States began developing it in response to the initial Soviet atomic bomb test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Remarkably, the Soviets developed their own H-bomb just three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While Soviet spycraft benefited their first atomic bomb development, the path to their H-bomb was different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Super

In September 1941, Italian physicist Enrico Fermi proposed an idea to Hungarian-American physicist [[Key figures and contributions to the hydrogen bomb development | Edward Teller]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Fermi wondered if the atomic bomb, then under production, could initiate a deuterium weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Such a weapon would generate energy by fusing hydrogen into helium, resulting in a much larger explosion than fission alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. There are claims that Japanese chemist Tokutaro Hagiwara might have conceived a similar idea earlier, in May 1941, though later translations suggest he was referring to something different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

[[Key figures and contributions to the hydrogen bomb development | Teller]] quickly became absorbed by this concept, advocating for its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. A team at Los Alamos began discussing the theories in the summer of 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Initially, it was believed that the fission bomb would be easy, allowing work to swiftly move to the "Super," as it was called, possibly before the war's end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:02:02]</a>. However, the A-bomb proved more challenging, consuming most resources for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. [[Key figures and contributions to the hydrogen bomb development | Teller]] largely worked on the "Super" independently during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## The Concept

The initial idea for the hydrogen bomb involved using neutrons and heat from a fission-based trigger bomb to initiate a nuclear fusion detonation in a mix of hydrogen isotopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This would combine a gun-type fission bomb with a cylinder of deuterium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Deuterium, a common form of hydrogen with one neutron, is normally a gas but can be liquefied when chilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. As deuterium atoms fuse, they release heat, propagating a chain reaction throughout the cylinder, potentially releasing energy equivalent to a thousand fission bombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. A significant advantage was the ability to arbitrarily scale the explosion's power by adding more deuterium, which is abundant in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Classical Super Problems

Problems quickly emerged with this "Classical Super" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. A pure deuterium-deuterium reaction would require hundreds of millions of degrees, exceeding an A-bomb's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Physicist Emil Konopinski suggested adding tritium, another hydrogen isotope, to act as a "lighter fluid" because deuterium-tritium reactions might occur more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. However, tritium is much rarer than deuterium and must be produced in nuclear reactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. By the end of 1945, the team had formalized and presented the Classical Super concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Building the Super

The Manhattan Project's initial motivation for building the A-bomb was a perceived race with Germany, with secrecy intended to prevent Axis acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. After the United States dropped two atomic weapons on Japan in August 1945, ending World War II and leaving the U.S. with a nuclear monopoly, the need for a bigger bomb became a question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Nevertheless, the idea of the Classical Super persisted as the Manhattan Project concluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Fuchs

In spring 1946, British scientist of German origin, Klaus Fuchs, joined the project after completing his work on atomic bomb detonation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Fuchs had been a communist activist since his youth, joining the German Communist Party in 1932 and fleeing to Britain in 1938 after the Nazis rose to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Despite this history, he was admitted to the Manhattan Project in 1944 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Fuchs made improvements to the Classical Super concept, suggesting that to enhance a fusion reaction, the deuterium-tritium mix should be encased in a radiation-impervious cladding to retain neutrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This early concept of "radiation implosion" was later patented with John von Neumann <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Although its full significance for a successful thermonuclear bomb design wasn't recognized at the time, it would later be crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:06:02]</a>.

In June 1946, Fuchs left the Manhattan Project for Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Upon his return, it was discovered he had passed critical information on atomic bomb design and construction to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. He was imprisoned for eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. While the Soviets had a strong nuclear science community and would have developed the atomic bomb eventually, Fuchs's reports accelerated their progress by 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Turning to the Soviets

In September 1945, Soviet scientists began receiving intelligence reports about the Classical Super design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Some Soviet physicists were already exploring the idea, with one sending a memo to Igor Kurchatov, the scientific director of the nuclear program, about using intense heat from an atomic explosion to fuse hydrogen into helium, tapping the "energy source of the stars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

U.S. intelligence reports from late 1945 detailed the Classical Super design: a uranium gun-type atomic bomb as a trigger with deuterium and deuterium-tritium containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. These reports also included Fermi's lectures on the weapon's physics and tritium's role in lowering fusion threshold temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

Support for a Soviet Super gained momentum in October 1945 when the London Times reported Professor Marcus Oliphant's remarks on the possibility of a 2 megaton TNT-equivalent bombâ€”100 times larger than those used on Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. The Soviets questioned Niels Bohr about this "superbomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Bohr was puzzled, stating that a larger bomb was either impractical due to size or unrealistic if it involved new substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Despite Bohr's skepticism, the American intelligence reports were enough; the Soviets, already behind in atomic technology, felt compelled to pursue the even more powerful "superbomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## The Possibility

Kurchatov tasked Yakov Zeldovich's working group to investigate the superbomb's feasibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. In December 1945, their report, "Utilization of the nuclear energy of light elements," confirmed the possibility of a nuclear fusion bomb, and the group was ordered to continue refining the approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

Throughout 1946 and 1947, new intelligence reports and press articles, including a 1947 article in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists by [[Key figures and contributions to the hydrogen bomb development | Edward Teller]], kept the USSR informed of American work on the "superbomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. In September 1947, Fuchs, back in the UK, told a Soviet intelligence officer that Fermi and [[Key figures and contributions to the hydrogen bomb development | Teller]] were working on a feasible superbomb in Chicago, though he was unsure if the Americans would proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. He explained its operating principles, including the use of a deuterium and tritium mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## Getting Serious

In November 1947, Zeldovich's group proposed propagating a massive shock wave through a thermonuclear fuel mix of deuterium, tritium, and lithium, with lithium's inclusion apparently based on another intelligence report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The USSR Council of Ministers accepted this and established Designing Bureau-11 (KB-11) in the secret town of Sarov, where Zeldovich's team relocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

In March 1948, Fuchs provided detailed documents on the American superbomb design, including its radiation jacket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. These were translated and sent to Stalin and Laventy Beria, head of the NKVD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Alarmed by the perceived U.S. progress, they pushed to accelerate alternative nuclear bomb designs, including the H-bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. In April 1948, Beria instructed Kurchatov to study these documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. A June 1948 resolution ordered KB-11 to conduct feasibility studies on a new type of hydrogen bomb, with Fuchs's design becoming the basis for the "Tube" design or RDS-6t <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

## The First Idea

Meanwhile, Kurchatov asked theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate Igor Tamm at the Lebedev Physical Institute to review Zeldovich's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Tamm, believing the Soviet Union needed nuclear weapons despite misgivings about its leaders, recruited young physicists, including Andrei Sakharov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

Tamm, Sakharov, and their colleagues disliked the Zeldovich design and began developing their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. By 1948, Sakharov had a promising design he called the "First Idea," developed without access to Fuchs's superbomb documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The June 1948 resolution merged the Lebedev and KB-11 teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Layer Cake

Sakharov's design, eventually named RDS-6s, was nicknamed "Sloika," or "Layer Cake," due to its structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Though many details remain classified, the bomb was a sphere about 1.5 meters wide and 4.5 tons, similar in size to the original Soviet atomic bomb or the Fat Man bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

Inside, it featured layers of highly enriched uranium and a thermonuclear fuel mix of:
*   Lithium Deuteride, a solid compound of lithium and deuterium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   Lithium Deuteride Tritide, a variant with tritium mixed in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   Uranium tamper, encasing the fuel layers to delay the explosion and maximize yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

These layers were surrounded by chemical explosives to compress them, with the outer uranium layers triggering their own fission explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. The inclusion of lithium deuteride was Vitalii Ginzburg's "Second Idea," as he noted that lithium, when bombarded by neutrons, could create more tritium, providing additional fuel for the fusion explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

The result was a large fission-fusion-fission explosion, approximately 80% fission and 20% fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Tamm and Zeldovich agreed that the Sloika design had the most potential compared to the Tube/RDS-6t, focusing their efforts on building it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. This work occurred in 1948, before the first Soviet atomic test in August 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Unlike the U.S., there was no debate in the Soviet Union about proceeding with a larger bomb; after a two-week break post-atomic bomb shipment, they resumed work on their "hydrogen bomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

## Differences

The Layer Cake design cannot be considered a true thermonuclear bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. While it harnessed nuclear fusion, most of its total energy came from fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. It is more accurately described as a "boosted" fission bomb, where the fission explosion triggers thermonuclear reactions, which in turn produce neutrons that increase the fission explosion's efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:15:05]</a>. In contrast, the proposed "classical super concept" involved a fission bomb jump-starting a much larger, two-stage thermonuclear explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:17]</a>.

After World War II, Oppenheimer correctly doubted the technical feasibility of the classical Super, suggesting boosted fission weapons as an interim solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:29]</a>. [[Key figures and contributions to the hydrogen bomb development | Teller]], however, advocated for full commitment to the thermonuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

The first Soviet atomic bomb test, RDS-1, dramatically shifted the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Americans not only realized their nuclear monopoly had ended but also doubted their ability to predict the Soviet nuclear program's speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. After a significant debate, U.S. President Truman ordered the accelerated development of the superbomb in January 1950, a decision widely reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:16:06]</a>.

## The Problem

The primary challenge in achieving a staged thermonuclear weapon was delivering enough energy to deuterium to initiate fusion before the energy dissipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. As [[Key figures and contributions to the hydrogen bomb development | Edward Teller]] and his team worked on this, the Soviets responded to Truman's order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. Zeldovich's team presented the RDS-6s design and was authorized to proceed with a prototype for a test detonation by May 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:42]</a>. This timeline proved ambitious due to numerous experiments and technical issues, leading to a one-year delay for the Layer Cake prototype explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:56]</a>.

## The 1953 Test

The RDS-6s prototype was scheduled for detonation in August 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. The preceding year had been tense, with back-and-forth claims between the U.S. and Soviet Union regarding nuclear weaponry dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. In November 1952, the U.S. detonated Ivy Mike, considered the first test of a staged thermonuclear device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Ivy Mike used the groundbreaking Teller-Ulam design, which successfully solved the energy dissipation problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:26]</a>.

Ivy Mike yielded a 10.4-megaton explosion, 700 times larger than the Little Boy atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. However, the device itself weighed over 70 tons and was the size of a two-story house, making it impractical as a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:44]</a>.

Nevertheless, Beria and the government pressured Soviet scientists for a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Beria reportedly sent mathematicians to KB-11 as "replacements" if things went wrong and warned a KGB General:
> What does it mean, a superbomb? This is
> either a bomb of a bigger weight than the
> one that has already been invented, or a bomb
> which is made of some new substance. Well,
> the first is possible, but unreasonable,
> because, I repeat, the destructive power
> of the bomb is already very great, and
> the second - I believe - is unreal. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>

On August 8, 1953, days before the detonation, Georgy Malenkov informed the Supreme Soviet that the U.S. would not have a thermonuclear monopoly, making scientists realize the bomb had to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:29]</a>. Four days later, Kurchatov began the countdown at the Semipalatinsk test site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:45]</a>. An observer described the intensity of light, the trembling earth, and the powerful shock wave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. Tanks were tossed like toys, a 5-kilometer wide lake was formed, and birds fell from the sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:12]</a>. RDS-6s, called Joe-4 in the United States, was a successful detonation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

## The Third Idea

Soviet scientists estimated RDS-6s's yield at 400 kilotons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. American evaluation deemed it a "boosted fission device" and thus incapable of arbitrary scaling like "true" thermonuclear devices, but unlike Ivy Mike, RDS-6s was small enough for practical use as a weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:43]</a>. Soviet designers initially believed they could scale Layer Cake's yield to 1 or 2 megatons but later encountered practical limits in device size and efficiency with uranium-235 and tritium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:57]</a>.

At this time, the team was pursuing a more compelling idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. While working on the Tube design (inspired by Fuchs's 1948 material), scientists discussed using compression to heat thermonuclear fuel to millions of degrees, triggering a fusion reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:16]</a>. This idea of compression came from Lab director Viktor Davidenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:26]</a>.

For weeks, scientists explored using the trigger atomic bomb's shock wave or material explosion for compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:35]</a>. In spring 1954, several scientists independently realized that the majority of an atomic explosion's energy is released as X-rays, leading to the idea of using this radiation energy for compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:49]</a>. This concept, known as "Sakharov's Third Idea" (though Sakharov was not its sole originator), aligns with the American Teller-Ulam hydrogen bomb design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:21:10]</a>.

There is no indication that the Soviets used U.S. intelligence for this breakthrough; it developed organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. While Fuchs's design contained concepts of radiation implosion, its significance wasn't recognized by either the Soviets or Americans until later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:28]</a>. Work on the less efficient Layer Cake and Tube bombs was abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. The Soviet team crafted a physical design to fully implement radiation implosion, resulting in the RDS-37 device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:41]</a>. The infrastructure and supply chain established for Layer Cake contributed to RDS-37's rapid development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.

RDS-37 was detonated on November 22, 1955, yielding 1.6 megatons, with its two explosion phases visible in photographs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:59]</a>. The Soviet Union achieved the hydrogen bomb and parity with the United States far faster than anticipated in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

It has been suggested that Ivy Mike's fallout helped guide the Soviets toward how the bomb worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. Analyzing the fallout might have revealed elements with nuclei exposed to high neutron counts via compression, thus exposing the design secrets of the Teller-Ulam design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:22]</a>. However, subsequent reviews of contemporary archives indicate that the Soviets lacked the skill or technology for such radiological measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:34]</a>.

What Ivy Mikeâ€”and the subsequent 1954 Castle Bravo detonationâ€”did accomplish was to demonstrate to the Soviets that such a massive weapon was indeed possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:47]</a>. The awareness that "something else" was occurring was often enough to spur further development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. Soviet scientists express immense pride in their achievement, believing their work prevented a nuclear war by closing the hydrogen bomb gap with the United States in just a few years, ushering in a new stage in the rivalry between the two superpowers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:09]</a>.

Since late February 2022, Taiwan's Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) halted shipments to Russia due to a new round of sanctions, impacting companies like Baikal, MCST, Yadro, and STC Module. Intel and AMD have also ceased their shipments to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While Russia has aimed to develop its own semiconductor supply in recent years, its domestic manufacturing capacity has fallen increasingly behind, despite some successful domestic designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This has exacerbated [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | challenges in the semiconductor industry]] for Russia.

## Historical Context

Russia's current [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenges in semiconductor manufacturing]] are rooted in its Soviet history. The Soviet Union consistently suffered from a significant technology gap with the United States in computers and advanced electronics, dating back to the 1960s, a gap influenced by ideology, technology, and geopolitics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. By the time of the Soviet collapse in 1991, the country faced a severe shortage of sufficiently powerful integrated circuits; the combined computing power of all computers in the USSR was two generations behind a single American Cray supercomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

The dissolution of the Soviet scientific-industrial complex left Russia with 96% of vacuum electronics production facilities, while the more advanced semiconductor production facilities were located in East Germany, Belarus, and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Russia's industrial policy immediately post-collapse further worsened the situation by shifting away from domestic electronics, increasing reliance on imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Current State of Russian Semiconductor Manufacturing

Today, Russia remains a net importer of integrated circuits, with the majority coming from Malaysia, China, Vietnam, and Taiwan in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Threats of sanctions in 2014 following events in Crimea spurred the Russian government to pursue an import substitution scheme to develop homegrown chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Key Domestic Manufacturers

#### JSC Micron Group
Micron Group is Russia's largest domestic semiconductor manufacturing company, operating as an integrated design manufacturer. It accounts for 54% of the country's exported technology hardware and produces approximately 500 million chips annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

*   **History**: Founded in 1964 as the Research Institute for Molecular Electronics, its plant was the first in Russia to successfully produce an integrated circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. In the 1970s and 80s, it produced microprocessors for air defense and Venus space programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Current Operations**: Today, Micron fabs RFID tickets, SIM cards, and smart card products, specializing in RFID. They produce about 30 million banking, biometric passport, and transport cards annually, including chips for Russia's Mir payment system and Moscow's transport network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Financials**: In 2019, Micron generated around $195 million USD in revenue, increasing to $260 million USD in 2020, partly due to large subsidies from Moscow government organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. They reported a net loss in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Technological Capabilities**:
    *   Micron's Zelenograd fab produces 100, 150, and 200-millimeter wafers, with the 200-millimeter line being the most sophisticated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   In 2007, Micron signed a technology transfer deal with STMicroelectronics for their 180-nanometer process node, which expanded to 90-nanometer in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
    *   The 90-nanometer production line launched in 2012, costing 16.5 billion rubles (approx. $590 million USD at 2017 rates), co-financed by Rusnano, a government fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This node first reached commercial production in 2003 globally, placing Russia about nine years behind the leading edge at the time of launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   In 2014, Micron announced the successful achievement of a 65-nanometer node at 500 200-millimeter wafers per month, hailed as proof of Russian technology independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. However, this announcement appears to have been premature; without imported lithography scanners from the West or Japan, a 65-nanometer line is not commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Micron's website indicates their 65-nanometer line remains "under development, production qualification, and implementation," suggesting it's not yet ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Commercial 65-nanometer nodes were shipped globally by Fujitsu, Toshiba, and TSMC in 2005, meaning Russia's gap with the leading edge has expanded to 15+ years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
    *   In 2016, new management announced plans to invest in factory expansion for more chip types and LEDs, aiming for 30 billion rubles revenue by 2020. This included a 28-nanometer capable factory by 2018, though little has been heard about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The company missed its 2020 revenue target by 15 billion rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

#### Sytronix
A sister company to Micron, Sytronix applied for a subsidy in 2007 to develop a chip manufacturing fab at 65 and 45-nanometer process nodes on 300-millimeter wafers, costing approximately $2.3 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Chip production was scheduled to begin in 2009, but the high capital intensity of the project, coupled with a lack of technology partners, led Sytronix to pull back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Currently, their website lists servers, IT software, and smartwatches, but no chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

#### Angstrom
Another leading microelectronics fab based in Zelenograd, Angstrom dates back to 1963. It was known for developing and producing the Electronics NTS-8010, the Soviet Union's first entirely domestic computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

*   **Capabilities**: Angstrom currently offers 130-nanometer and 90-nanometer process nodes on 200-millimeter wafers, with a capacity of about 180,000 wafers per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This is a small fraction of a TSMC gigafab's monthly output, highlighting a severe lack of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Financial and Sanction Issues**:
    *   Angstrom filed for bankruptcy in 2018 or 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
    *   In 2008, the company borrowed nearly $1 billion USD from state development bank VEB to purchase old 110 and 130-nanometer chip-making equipment from AMD, aiming to produce 90-nanometer smart card microchips by 2010 and upgrade to 65-nanometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
    *   The company failed to meet these targets, with chips not rolling off the line until 2016, and their 65-nanometer process is still unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
    *   Angstrom was subsequently hit by U.S. sanctions, likely due to its involvement in the Russian military and nuclear industries. This prevented it from building an export business, and combined with its debt, led to insolvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Restructuring**: In 2021, VEB's subsidiary, NM-Tech, purchased Angstrom's assets for 8.4 billion rubles. They have a 10-year plan to convert into a pure-play foundry and aim for 10-nanometer production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

## Domestic Design Ventures and Foreign Fabrication

Due to the domestic industry's lagging capabilities, more sophisticated Russian semiconductor design ventures must rely on foreign fabs for production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

*   **Elbrus Microprocessors**: Developed by the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies (MCST), the Elbrus 2SM was declared the first completely Russian microprocessor and the country's top technology achievement in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. However, this 90-nanometer processor was primarily for PR purposes, and its initial iteration, fabbed on a TSMC 90-nanometer node, reportedly performed better than the later Micron version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The latest, Elbrus 8CB, is fabbed on a 28-nanometer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Baikal CPUs**: Baikal Electronics uses modern practices and EDA tools (like Synopsys) to develop ARM-based chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Their latest offering, the Baikal-M series (an eight-core system-on-chip), is fabbed on a TSMC 28-nanometer process, and a RISC-V version is being explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Sales were strong, with plans to order over 200,000 pieces from TSMC in Q1 2021, though they faced capacity issues due to automotive chip shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Baikal was acquired by Varton Group in June 2021, and announced plans to invest 23 billion rubles to expand into servers, develop a 6-nanometer chip, and sell over half a million chips, mostly to government organizations meeting import substitution policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

## Potential Alternatives for Russian Semiconductor Needs

Given the current sanctions and the lagging domestic industry, it is doubtful Russia's semiconductor manufacturing will advance beyond 65-nanometers in the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. [[Potential alternatives for Russian semiconductor needs | Alternatives for Russian semiconductor needs]] might come from friendly countries.

*   **Belarus (Integral)**: Integral was one of the three major Soviet semiconductor manufacturers. Launched in 1962, it is an integrated design manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. However, Integral's most sophisticated node in 2017 was a 350-nanometer process, which first hit the market in 1993 (used for the Nintendo 64). This is not a viable alternative to a TSMC 28-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **China (SMIC)**: Shanghai-based SMIC's most advanced node is a 14-nanometer process, rumored to have good yields, though it's a small part of their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. SMIC had a strong 2021 and is investing $9 billion in a new fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Given warm relations between Russia and China, SMIC might seem like a logical alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. However, SMIC heavily relies on chip-making equipment imports from the Netherlands and Japan, which could pose a challenge under secondary sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## Impact of Sanctions and Broader Implications

In the short and medium term, the halt in shipments might not have a massive immediate impact, as Russia has large stockpiles and contingency plans, and military equipment doesn't require leading-edge chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. However, these sanctions will push Russia's remaining industries further behind its competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Even Russia's largest industries consistently lag Western peers in digitization and modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Russia has 23 times fewer industrial robots per 10,000 employees than the world average, and only 10% of its industry uses computer numerical control (CNC) machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. These sanctions make it significantly harder for Russian businesses and individuals to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. The inability of the Soviet Communist Party to close the widening technology gap with the West contributed to a broad loss of confidence in its competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. While times are different, history offers a cautionary tale for the future of [[russian_domestic_semiconductor_companies_and_their_developments | Russian domestic semiconductor companies and their developments]] and the overall industrial landscape.

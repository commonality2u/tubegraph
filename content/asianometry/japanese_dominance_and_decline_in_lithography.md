From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

In the mid-1990s, two Japanese companies, Nikon and Canon, collectively held a three-quarter share of the photolithography market, dominating the space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, a Dutch company, [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]], subsequently rose to overtake them, relegating them to minor players in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Today, Nikon and Canon no longer compete at the cutting edge, while [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]] is Europe's most valuable technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Photolithography Basics
A photolithography stepper or scanner acts as a nanoscale printer, creating integrated circuit patterns onto a wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A single wafer can produce hundreds of dies, which are the final components in chips like the Apple M1 or A13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The process involves coating a silicon wafer with a photoresist chemical, projecting the integrated circuit design using the stepper/scanner, and then etching away unexposed areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This multi-step process is repeated until the desired sophistication is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The photolithography machine is one of the most critical machines in this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Rise to Dominance
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the United States, primarily through companies like Perkin Elmer and Geophysics Corporation of America (GCA), dominated the photolithography tools market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This alarmed the Japanese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

In response, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry reorganized Japan's computer industry, bringing together leading optical manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. They were tasked with catching up to American leaders, an effort famously known as the VLSI research project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

This initiative led to Nikon introducing its first commercial stepper in 1980, with Canon quickly following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Their products offered superior performance at lower prices, enabling the two Japanese companies to overthrow American dominance and rule the market in less than a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. At this point, [[japans_early_leadership_in_lithography | Japan's technical lead in lithography tools]] seemed insurmountable, with no other viable competitors on the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## The Decline and [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]]'s Ascendance
[[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]] was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between Dutch firms ASM International and Philips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Despite losing money for its first six years, Philips' backing helped [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]] persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. By its IPO in 1995, [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]] had acquired 25% of the market share, tied with Canon but still behind Nikon's 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Three major industry shifts allowed [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]] to seize market and [[role_of_technology_and_innovation_in_lithography | technological leadership]] from Canon and Nikon:

*   **Twinscan System (2001):** [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]] introduced its first Twinscan system in 2001, which processes wafers in two stages: measurement and exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This dual-wielding approach significantly increased the number of wafers processed per hour, though it added complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Nikon and Canon were unable to replicate this [[role_of_technology_and_innovation_in_lithography | technology]] quickly enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. By 2002, [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]] held 50% of the lithography tools market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

*   **Immersion Lithography:** The second breakthrough came with [[development_of_uv_and_euv_lithography_technology | immersion lithography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Unlike previous techniques with an air gap between the wafer and stepper, [[development_of_uv_and_euv_lithography_technology | immersion lithography]] replaces this gap with water, shooting ultraviolet light through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Though long used in optical microscopes, the industry largely ignored it until Taiwanese scientist Bern Lin demonstrated its viability for reaching a 45 nanometer process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]] was the first to commercialize it with the Twinscan AT1150i in 2003, followed by the volume immersion product Twinscan XT 1700i in 2006, cementing its dominant position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

*   **EUV Lithography:** The industry knew [[development_of_uv_and_euv_lithography_technology | immersion lithography]] was a stop-gap measure, as optical wavelengths would eventually be insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The industry debated various next-generation options, eventually choosing [[development_of_uv_and_euv_lithography_technology | EUV]] (Extreme Ultraviolet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Major chipmakers banded together to support [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]] in commercializing this [[role_of_technology_and_innovation_in_lithography | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Practical [[development_of_uv_and_euv_lithography_technology | EUV]] systems arrived a decade late and significantly over budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Canon never had a chance in this segment, and Nikon largely halted progress after 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. [[development_of_uv_and_euv_lithography_technology | EUV]] cemented the massive technical gap between [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]] and its Japanese competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Theories for Japan's Decline

While [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]]'s breakthroughs are clear, the reasons for Japan's significant decline are complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Several theories have been proposed:

### 1. Software Deficiency
[[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]]'s machines have seen an explosion in complexity, with products in 2000 using 6 times the CPUs and 8 times the sensors as those from 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This hardware requires extensive software:
*   Their 1989 PAS 5000 stepper had 200 million lines of source code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   Their 2003 Twinscan had 1.25 billion lines, a six-fold increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   A single Twinscan alone has 12.5 million lines of embedded device code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   The software team grew significantly, at one point employing over 350 people, doubling in size every four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

[[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]] managed this complexity effectively, being among the first to use Unified Modeling Language (UML) for software development, which was critical for their shipments in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. In contrast, Canon and Nikon were not as strong in software, and Japanese companies only recently began adopting abstraction-heavy software practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### 2. Decline of Japan's Semiconductor Industry
Canon and Nikon's market share growth in the 1980s coincided with the broader rise of Japan's semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Companies like NEC, Mitsubishi Electric, Hitachi, and Toshiba dominated the chip-making market, particularly memory, holding 90% of the 256K DRAM market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Many of these companies formed the core market for Canon and Nikon's lithography tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

However, in the 1990s, Japanese low-cost exports became a political issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. American semiconductor companies successfully lobbied for limits on Japanese competitors, which, combined with the appreciation of the yen, led to Japan pulling back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This directly impacted Canon and Nikon's business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. While another major Japanese semiconductor tool supplier, Tokyo Electron, successfully looked abroad to compensate for lost business, Nikon and Canon were less successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### 3. Focus on Optics vs. System Optimization
Canon and Nikon originated as optics systems companies, and while they developed their full lithography tool stack, their core work always revolved around lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. As semiconductor engineering pushed physical limits, engineers needed to find other ways to optimize performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

[[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]], perhaps because it outsourced its optics R&D to Zeiss, was able to look beyond mere optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This enabled them to find new opportunities to optimize tool performance, such as better utilizing new chemicals in photoresists and photomasks, and developing the two-stage wafer swap process for the Twinscan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

### 4. R&D and Industry Collaboration
[[role_of_technology_and_innovation_in_lithography | R&D]] and industry collaboration played significant roles in [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]]'s rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]]-Philips-Zeiss block benefited from close ties to IMEC, a semi-governmental nonprofit in Belgium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. IMEC is a leading semiconductor research center that works closely with industry and academia to develop new [[role_of_technology_and_innovation_in_lithography | technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Crucially, IMEC facilitates cross-industry collaboration, helping companies work together on new standards and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This exposure helped [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]] understand how its tools were used and how they interacted with other vendors' equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Evidence of [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]]'s collaborative nature is seen in the number of joint papers published with chipmakers, toolmakers, and chemical makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

In contrast, Canon and Nikon lacked a similar collaborating body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Most of Nikon's published papers were done independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. While Japanese companies did exchange information with long-term partners, these exchanges were often limited to addressing serious problems, rather than fostering new ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Ironically, Canon and Nikon's initial rise in the 1980s was due to a similar resource-sharing project, the VLSI project, which was government-mandated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. No such initiative has replaced it since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

Furthermore, ties between industry and academia in Japan are particularly weak compared to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Industry professionals are wary of disclosing trade secrets, and university professors tend to focus on basic science without strong incentives for industrial application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This contrasts with Western institutions like MIT, Stanford, and Berkeley, which have Technology Licensing Organizations (TLOs) to guide and profit from discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | ASML]]'s success was undeniably facilitated by the simultaneous decline in competitiveness from the Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. While a plethora of theories exist, the exact reasons for Japan's significant loss of market share remain complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. A key lesson is the importance of paying close attention to times of generational shifts in [[role_of_technology_and_innovation_in_lithography | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. [[development_of_uv_and_euv_lithography_technology | Immersion]] and [[development_of_uv_and_euv_lithography_technology | EUV]] lithography represented such shifts, where market leaders can become laggards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

Despite the high-profile decline of Canon and Nikon, Japan's semiconductor industry still retains many "hidden industry champions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. These companies, with legacies from earlier years, made the right decisions, adapted, and survived, remaining crucial to the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

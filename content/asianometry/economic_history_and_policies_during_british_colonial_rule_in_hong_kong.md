Under British colonial administration, Hong Kong's economic development took a unique path, largely shaped by its initial designation as a simple trading post and specific fiscal policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

## Early Economic Setup and Fiscal Policy
The British colonial administration initially intended Hong Kong to be nothing more than a small trading post connecting China and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. An early fiscal compromise was established: no import or export taxes would be levied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. Instead, the government generated revenue primarily from land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. The government holds superior title to all land and leases it to private parties for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. This system incentivized an economy focused on rising land prices and trading, whether financial or otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

By 1949, Hong Kong's largest companies were predominantly banks, land development companies, and trading houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Many former industrialists, such as [[The shift from manufacturing to service industries in Hong Kong | Li Ka-shing]], had already transitioned from manufacturing to becoming landlords, viewing it as more profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. These dominant companies saw no compelling reason for the government to intervene on behalf of the manufacturing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. Consequently, the Hong Kong government maintained a non-interventionist economic stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.

## Rise and Decline of Manufacturing
Following the Chinese Civil War, Shanghai's industrialists, along with many refugees, fled to Hong Kong to escape the Communist Party of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. These industrialists brought capital and manufacturing expertise, re-establishing factories to leverage the labor opportunities provided by approximately one million poor Chinese migrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Due to limited land, factories produced lightly manufactured items like plastic flowers, clothes, and radio assemblies from high-rise buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

Hong Kong's manufacturing industry boomed from the 1950s as the United States and other Western nations began outsourcing manufactured goods from Asia, a trend that intensified over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. By the early 1960s, Hong Kong had become the largest manufacturer in the developing world, with these low-skilled jobs helping people build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>.

However, [[Impact of competition from China and other Asian economies on Hong Kong | competition emerged]] from places like South Korea and Taiwan, and costs rose as workers' salaries improved and new generations demanded richer lifestyles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Hong Kong's manufacturing industries had little to offer beyond cheap labor, lacking the technological expertise to produce native technologies for critical components, which had to be imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. For instance, in electronics, 60% of OEM costs were spent on integrated circuits imported from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

As early as 1981, the city's manufacturers sought government assistance for technological upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Unlike governments in Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea, which invested heavily in acquiring and "naturalizing" their own technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, Hong Kong, still a British colony, maintained its non-interventionist stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

## Shift to a Service Economy
This non-interventionist approach led to the [[Deindustrialization and its impact on Hong Kongs economy | deindustrialization]] of the Hong Kong economy, with manufacturing largely relocating to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. This resulted in a significant loss of lower and middle-income jobs and an intensified focus on finance and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. Hong Kong ceased primarily making and exporting goods, instead becoming a value-added intermediary for handling investments and cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. Its British heritage, English language, laws, and pro-business attitudes facilitated trade between Western companies and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

The service industry's contribution to Hong Kong's GDP dramatically increased:
*   **1980:** 68% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>
*   **2000:** 86.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>
*   **2019:** 93.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>

Construction became the second largest sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. Hong Kong's economy today produces little beyond the efforts of its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

### Post-Colonial Continuity
Even after the handover, Hong Kong chief executives like Tung Chee-hwa and Donald Tsang continued the de-manufacturing trend, emphasizing the benefits of free capital and trade flow between China and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. The Hong Kong dollar has been pegged to the United States dollar since 1983, limiting the government's control over interest rate policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.

This economic strategy, while generating wealth for many and leading to a higher GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:00">[16:35:00]</a>, has also meant that Hong Kong no longer produces goods other people want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>. The focus on finance and services has led to the conversion of public goods and even people into investable assets or cash flow streams, often at significant cost to the majority of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>. There was an opportunity for Hong Kong's electronics industry to advance technologically, potentially even becoming like a "Hong Kong TSMC" given its ties with the West at the time, but this opportunity was not pursued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>.

Undersea cables serve as the "unheralded backbones" of our global communications network, spanning the globe and carrying gigabits of information [00:00:02]. Despite their seemingly low-tech nature, these cables underpin much of our hyper-connected world, enduring a dangerous environment [00:00:10].

## Beginnings

The idea of leaving an unexposed copper cable at the bottom of the harsh sea seemed unwise [00:00:25]. The earliest underwater experiments took place in 1811 when German polymath Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring, while building Bavaria's first telegraph network, attempted to cross a river [00:00:31]. He wrapped his cable in rubber to keep it dry [00:00:41]. However, this failed as rubber, being a water-absorbent vegetable protein, allowed water to reach the copper [00:00:47].

A few years later, in 1838, Irish physician and telegraph pioneer Dr. William Brooke O'Shaughnessy developed a new method to prevent water leakage [00:00:54]. He wrapped the wire in rattan (a palm material) and then in tar-covered yarn [00:01:04]. This successfully sealed and protected the cable from river water [00:01:09].

## Protecting the Cables

In 1845, the Brett Brothers proposed laying a telegraph cable from Dover, England, to Calais, France [00:01:20]. In 1850, they deployed a half-inch thick telegraph cable, wrapped in gutta percha—an inert organic plastic sourced from Malaysia—from a paddleboat, possibly named the Goliah [00:01:28]. As expected, this unprotected cable, weighed down by only a few lead bricks, did not perform well 54 meters under the sea [00:01:45]. It carried only a few distorted telegraph signals before failing the next morning, reportedly cut by a French fisherman [00:01:56].

For their subsequent attempt, railway engineer Thomas Russell Crampton devised a new plan [00:02:05]. He wrapped the cable in steel wire and deployed it in 1851 [00:02:11]. This design proved successful over the following years [00:02:17]. Since then, virtually every submarine cable has generally followed this model: one or more copper wires at the core, wrapped in gutta percha insulation [00:02:21].

The first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable, laid in 1866, was 2,500 miles long and featured three layers of gutta percha insulation [00:02:32]. Over 300 tons of gutta percha were used in total for this project [00:02:42]. Gutta percha was eventually superseded by the plastic polyethylene in the 1940s [00:02:47]. Around the core, a cushioning layer and Crampton's armoring steel wires are typically added [00:02:53]. To deter bacteria in tropical waters from consuming the gutta percha, cable makers sometimes applied powdered silica or brass tape [00:02:58].

## Modern Cables and [[technological_advancements_in_cable_design|Technological Advancements in Cable Design]]

As communications [[technological_advancements_in_cable_design|technologies changed]], so did the cables that carried them [00:03:10]. Telegraph cables gave way to telephone cables [00:03:15]. The introduction of repeaters in the 1940s boosted signals and improved data quality [00:03:19]. In the 1980s, the advent of optic fiber vastly increased the data bandwidth these cables could carry [00:03:25]. While tweaks have been made to accommodate these new changes and differing environments, the main setup remains consistent [00:03:36].

A number of cable variants exist in the industry:
*   **Lightweight Cables** These are the industry workhorses, featuring only steel wires and polyethylene, suitable for shallow, safe, and stable waters [00:03:47].
*   **Lightweight Protective Cables** Add more polyethylene and steel tape layers primarily to combat animals and chafing [00:04:01].
*   **Single-Armored Cables** Are lightweight cables with a single layer of steel wire and polyethylene wrapping, providing extra strength in areas with higher risks of cable-cutting [00:04:13].
*   **Double-Armored Cables** These "beefy" cables have two armoring layers of galvanized steel wires around the exterior of a standard lightweight cable [00:04:26]. They are deployed in shallow, high-traffic waters where burying the cable is not possible [00:04:40].

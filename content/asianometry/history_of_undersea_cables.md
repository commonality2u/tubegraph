Undersea cables serve as the unheralded backbones of our global communications network, carrying gigabits of information across the globe [00:00:02]. Much of our hyper-connected, high-tech world relies on these seemingly low-tech cables, which navigate a dangerous underwater environment [00:00:10].

## Beginnings

Early experiments with underwater cables began in 1811 [00:00:31]. The German polymath Samuel Thomas von Sömmerring, who was building the first telegraph network in Bavaria, needed to cross a river [00:00:34]. His initial attempt involved wrapping a copper cable in rubber to keep it dry [00:00:41]. However, this failed because rubber is a water-absorbent vegetable protein, allowing water to reach the copper [00:00:47].

A few years later, in 1838, Irish physician and telegraph pioneer Dr. William Brooke O'Shaughnessy developed a new method to prevent water leakage [00:00:54]. He wrapped the wire in rattan, a palm material, and then wrapped it again with tar-covered yarn [00:01:04]. This successfully sealed the cable and protected it from river water [00:01:09].

## Protecting the Cables: Early Innovations

In 1845, the Brett Brothers proposed laying a telegraph cable from Dover, England, to Calais, France [00:01:20]. They wrapped their half-inch-thick telegraph cable in gutta percha, an inert organic plastic sourced from Malaysia [00:01:28]. In 1850, they deployed it from a paddleboat, likely named the *Goliah* [00:01:34]. This early attempt at an undersea cable did not perform well 54 meters under the sea; it was unprotected, weighed down by only a few lead bricks, and carried only a few badly distorted telegraph signals before failing the next morning, reportedly cut by a French fisherman [00:01:45].

For their subsequent attempt, railway engineer Thomas Russell Crampton devised a new scheme [00:02:05]. In 1851, he deployed a cable wrapped in steel wire [00:02:11], which performed quite well over the next few years [00:02:17]. Virtually every submarine cable since has generally followed this model [00:02:21]. The core consists of one or several copper wires wrapped in gutta percha insulation [00:02:27].

The first transatlantic telegraph cable, laid in 1866, stretched 2,500 miles and featured three layers of gutta percha around its core, using over 300 tons of the material [00:02:32]. Gutta percha was eventually replaced by polyethylene plastic in the 1940s [00:02:47]. Around the core, a cushioning layer was added, followed by the armoring steel wires first introduced by Crampton [00:02:53]. To deter bacteria in tropical waters from eating the gutta percha, cable makers sometimes applied powdered silica or brass tape [00:02:58].

## Evolution of Cable Design

As [[modern_advancements_in_undersea_cable_technology | communications technologies]] evolved over the years, so did the cables carrying them [00:03:10]. Telegraph cables were succeeded by telephone cables [00:03:15]. The addition of repeaters in the 1940s helped boost signals and improve data quality [00:03:19]. The 1980s saw the introduction of optic fiber, which vastly upscaled the amount of data bandwidth these cables could carry [00:03:25].

[[construction_and_design_of_undersea_cables | Tweaks to the design]] were introduced to accommodate these new changes and differing environments [00:03:36]. While a number of cable variants exist, the main setup remains consistent [00:03:40]. Cable types developed over time to address specific needs:
*   **Lightweight cables** are the industry's workhorse, featuring steel wires and polyethylene [00:03:47]. These are suitable for shallow, safe, and stable waters [00:03:56].
*   **Lightweight Protective Cables** add more polyethylene and steel tape layers, primarily to combat animals and chafing [00:04:01].
*   **Single-armored cables** are lightweight cables with an additional layer of steel wire and polyethylene, providing extra protection where the risks of cable-cutting are greater [00:04:13].
*   **Double-armored cables** incorporate two armoring layers of galvanized steel wires around the lightweight cable [00:04:26]. These robust cables are deployed in shallow waters with high traffic or where the cable cannot be buried [00:04:40].

## Historical Hazards

[[environmental_and_human_hazards_to_undersea_cables | Subsea cables]] have been subject to various hazards throughout their history, including natural phenomena and human activities [00:06:05].

### Landslides and Earthquakes

Underwater landslides have plagued cables since the 1880s [00:07:10]. Cable repairing ships often noted instances of broken cables buried in fresh piles of sediment or gravel, though scientists did not initially connect these to underwater landslides [00:07:14].

A classic case study occurred with the Grand Banks Earthquake of 1929, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Canada [00:07:26]. An hour later, a massive underwater landslide triggered the movement of over 175 cubic kilometers of sand and sediment, cutting eleven cables [00:07:37]. This event is now cited as the textbook example of underwater landslide hazards [00:07:45]. The earthquake itself also cut 12 cables [00:08:46].

Another notable incident involved a pair of 7.0 magnitude earthquakes in 2006 off the southwest coast of Taiwan, which triggered several landslides and broke multiple cables [00:07:53]. Losing these cables affected communications not only in Taiwan but also across Southeast Asia, as many routes passed through the island [00:08:05].

### Fishermen

Historically, human activities, particularly fishing, have been a significant source of damage. Two-thirds of all cable breaks in depths under 200 meters have occurred due to ship anchors and fishermen's nets [00:09:40].

The 1884 Cable Convention, the most widely known international law on cables, stipulates that if a fisherman's anchors or nets become caught in a cable, they are obligated to sacrifice their equipment and report the incident to the cable owner [00:10:56]. In return, fishermen are entitled to an indemnity for their sacrificed equipment [00:11:11]. This risk led undersea cable operators to dig trenches for their cables or double-armor them in waters less than 1,500 meters deep [00:11:21].

## Sabotage and Warfare

While most cable breaks are accidental, intentional cable cuts have occurred throughout history [00:11:43]. Many have been thefts for financial gain, such as the March 2007 incident where two vessels, including one from Vietnam, removed 79 and 98 kilometers of cable from two Southeast Asian networks to sell the copper, damaging Vietnam's internet for three months [00:11:51]. Similar incidents have occurred in Jamaica, Indonesia, and Egypt [00:12:10].

Cable cutting has also been a critical focus of war planning as a measure of asymmetrical warfare due to its ability to interrupt communications [00:12:33]. For instance, British control of the subsea cable network cut off the Central Powers of World War I from their overseas possessions [00:12:41]. This also forced the Axis powers of World War II to communicate via encrypted radio, which opened the door to interception and decryption [00:12:48].

Even today, reports of cable cuts in the Red Sea continue to impact internet speeds [00:12:57]. The relative ease of cutting a subsea cable—simply by dropping an anchor and dragging it across the sea floor—combined with the high cost of repair, makes it an effective tactic for asymmetrical warfare, easy to execute and easy to deny deliberate intent [00:13:04].

## Historical Protection Measures

The best way to [[protection_and_security_measures_for_undersea_cables | protect a cable]] has historically been to dig a deep trench, lay the cable, and cover it [00:13:22]. Early methods likely involved manual labor, but modern trenching is done using high-pressure water jets or specialized underwater trenching machines [00:13:27].

The depth to which a cable is buried depends on conditions [00:13:44]. In the late 1990s, fiber optic operators developed a "Burial Protection Index" to gauge burial depth, which was used for thousands of miles of cable but is now considered outdated [00:13:57]. Today, the depth is left to the installer's risk assessment [00:14:09].

When the ground is too hard to cut through, alternatives like "riprap" or rock armor have been used to protect cables, often by laying smaller rocks on top of the cable and then larger rocks [00:14:15]. Other methods include cover plates or casing pipes that encase the cable [00:14:38].

Despite the growth of services like SpaceX's StarLink, undersea cables continue to carry the majority of the world's internet and telephone traffic, making their protection critical [00:15:28].

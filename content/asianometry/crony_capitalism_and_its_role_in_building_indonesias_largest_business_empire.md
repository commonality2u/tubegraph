From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

At its peak, Indonesia's [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] was a $22 billion conglomerate, the country's largest business group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Its founder, Lim Sioe Liong, also known as Soedono Salim, was Southeast Asia's wealthiest man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The group's remarkable ascent was largely due to its personal connection with authoritarian leader Suharto, who was a close friend of Lim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Few companies dominated a single country like [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] did Indonesia, a dominance that persisted until the [[impact_of_the_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | Asian financial crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Lim Sioe Liong's Early Life and Suharto Connection

Lim Sioe Liong, born Lin Xiaolian, arrived in Java in 1938 at age 21, fleeing the Second Sino-Japanese War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Though not penniless, he relied on a network of family and ethnic clan members for assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Indonesia was then a Dutch colony, with an economy centered on commodity exports and dominated by Dutch businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Lim began as an ethnic Chinese trader, selling clothes and later starting a coffee grinding business with his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. During the Japanese occupation, he was briefly arrested but survived by selling various goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

After Japan's occupation ended in 1945, Indonesia entered a four-year struggle for independence against returning Dutch forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Lim launched a supplies business, smuggling essentials like soap, coffee, sugar, and rice to the Indonesian Republican Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. It is rumored he also ran guns and ammunition, though he denied this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. During this period, working in Central Java, Lim impressed soldiers with his diligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. A logistics officer, Cilardi, introduced Lim to his cousin, Suharto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Indonesia gained independence in December 1949, with Sukarno as its first president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Under Sukarno, foreign investors and the Chinese ethnic minority faced difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Sukarno's socialist leanings led to suspicion of foreign capital and policies aimed at "indigenizing" foreign businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. In 1958, his government seized all Dutch assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Despite warming relations with China, Indonesia's Chinese minorities experienced discrimination and violence, largely due to their dominance in business and perceived support for the Dutch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

In 1952, facing racial discrimination in rural areas, Lim moved to Jakarta, becoming one of many ethnic Chinese businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. In 1956, Suharto was appointed commander of the local division in Semarang, where he and Lim rekindled their friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Suharto valued reliability, and Lim consistently delivered, even at a personal loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. As Suharto rose through the military ranks, he became Lim's patron and protector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Suharto's New Order and the Rise of Crony Capitalism

The mid-1950s saw economic weakness and political turmoil under Sukarno, whose anti-imperialist ideologies brought him closer to Communists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. His neglect of the economy, combined with the end of the Korean War, led to hyperinflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Power struggles culminated in the attempted coup of September 30, 1965, which Suharto used as an opportunity to lead a Western-backed counter-coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This devolved into mass killings of hundreds of thousands of suspected Communists, [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_chinese_businesses_in_indonesia | ethnic Chinese]], and other leftists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. In March 1966, Sukarno transferred power to Suharto, who declared a "New Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

[[economic_and_political_dynamics_in_indonesia_during_suhartos_presidency | Suharto's presidency]] marked a significant shift in Indonesia's internal and external policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The country rejoined the United Nations and began economic reforms to combat hyperinflation and insufficient revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Indonesia opened itself to foreign capital and aid, inviting light manufacturing facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This development plan led to consistent economic growth throughout [[economic_and_political_dynamics_in_the_new_order | Suharto's reign]], but also created new opportunities for corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### The Foundation of Corruption and "Kukong"

Corruption between the military and business community predated Suharto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. In the 1950s, military commanders partnered with local businessmen, known as "kukong" (Hokkien for Boss), often [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_chinese_businesses_in_indonesia | ethnic Chinese]], to raise funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. These businessmen received favors and concessions in exchange for financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. After independence, the military became involved in providing daily services, from shipping to hotels to timber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

Throughout his presidency, Suharto solidified a [[economic_and_political_dynamics_in_indonesia_during_suhartos_presidency | crony capitalist]] political pyramid, collecting "rents" from a wide range of economic activities that flowed upwards to himself and his inner circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The government partnered with economic cronies in the private sector, granting them preferential benefits to achieve state goals and generate profits for redistribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Suharto ensured a separation of economic and political power, making his Chinese business partners reliant on his protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Lim started as one of Suharto's "kukong" but quickly became the most prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Key Monopolies and Expansions

*   **Cloves**: In 1966, Lim was granted one of two exclusive licenses to import cloves from Africa, a vital ingredient for Indonesia's popular *kretek* cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. While Lim received a small percentage, the majority of profits went to a slush fund controlled by the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This provided critical early funds for Lim's expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Flour Milling**: Introduced to wheat via U.S. food aid in 1967, Indonesia lacked milling capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. In the late 1960s, Malaysian tycoon Robert Kwok suggested Lim open flour mills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The two partnered, and in 1969, founded Bogasari Flour Mills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Bogasari swiftly received a monopoly for wheat import, milling, and distribution across Western Indonesia, covering 80% of the country's population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This business was immensely profitable, with 25-35% profit margins, fueled by the rising popularity of wheat products like instant noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Again, 26% of the company's profits were directed to foundations headed by Suharto and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. [[indofoods_expansion_into_african_markets | Salim Group's food business]] later expanded to become [[indofoods_expansion_into_african_markets | Indofood]], a $7 billion conglomerate producing instant noodles, biscuits, milk, and chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Indofood became one of the world's largest instant noodle producers, controlling 90% of the Indonesian market throughout the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Cement**: Following Indonesia's first five-year development plan (repolito) to build domestic cement capacity, Suharto directed Lim to enter the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. With help from Taiwan's Tuntex Group, Lim built a massive cement complex near Jakarta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. The oil export boom of the 1970s fueled demand for new construction, allowing Lim to build one of the world's largest cement companies, controlling 60% of Indonesia's total cement production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. When oil prices tumbled in 1984, leading to a cement recession, Suharto ordered the government to purchase 35% of what is now PT Indocement, effectively bailing out Lim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

By the end of the 1970s, [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] had grown from three companies in 1957 to 54 companies across six fields: trading, automobile manufacturing, property and construction, finance, and natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. The group exploded in the mid-1980s, reaching over 225 affiliated businesses by 1986, with nearly $1 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. By 1989, estimates cited over 350 companies affiliated with Lim, many operating as monopolies or near-monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Examples include Indomobile Group, one of Indonesia's biggest car manufacturers, and Indomaret, Indonesia's largest convenience store chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The complex structure of these holdings, with separate entities for each factory controlled by Lim, his family, and partners, made identifying the true scope challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Bank Central Asia (BCA)

One of [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group's]] most valuable businesses was its bank, Bank Central Asia (BCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Lim acquired a small knitting company with a banking license in the 1950s, which he renamed BCA and moved to Jakarta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. While some shares were distributed to Suharto's generals and children, BCA remained small until 1975 when Lim recruited Mukhtar Riady <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Riady, a banking prodigy who had built Pan Indonesian Bank into the country's largest private bank, was enticed by Lim to run BCA, becoming its largest shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

To grow BCA, Riady leveraged Lim's empire, securing banking relationships with customers of Bogasari and the cement businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. He overhauled the bank's systems, computerizing and linking branches, issuing credit cards, cross-selling financial products, and installing hundreds of ATMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. In just three years, Riady transformed BCA into Indonesia's biggest private bank, with deposits soaring from 1 billion Indonesian Rupiah in 1974 to 7.5 trillion Rupiah in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Riady later transitioned out to focus on his family's Lipo Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Despite BCA's continued growth, banking reforms in 1989 made it easier to start new banks, introducing competition that would cause future troubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

## Challenges and Diversification

As Suharto entered his 70s, he became increasingly out of touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. His grown children began to flex their political muscles, elbowing out trusted advisors, and their incompetence and self-interest turned public opinion against the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. An infamous example occurred in 1990 when Suharto created a single clove monopoly for his youngest son, Tommy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. The 28-year-old mismanaged the industry so badly that Bank Indonesia had to contribute $350 million to bail out the monopoly and restore clove deliveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

Lim and his family sensed the changing political winds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. In 1981, he founded a small financial services company in Hong Kong called First Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. Starting in the mid-1980s, Lim began building real estate and consumer businesses in Hong Kong, China, and Singapore through First Pacific, deliberately making investments that did not rely on his political ties to Suharto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

The oil export boom that fueled Indonesia's growth in the 1970s dried up in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. In response, the government passed reforms to ease import and export regulations, including cutting red tape and lowering tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. While these initially worked, non-oil exports sputtered in 1994, partly due to investors pivoting to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. More reforms followed, removing limits on foreign investment and opening new sectors, though protections remained for industries dominated by Suharto's children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. Foreign investment rebounded, and GDP growth reached about 8% annually in the following years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

During this period, the [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] experienced significant expansion, with investments, partnerships, and acquisitions across Asia, growing at 40-50% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. By 1995, its total revenues were estimated at $9-$11 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. Independent analysts estimated 1996 revenues across all Lim's companies at $22.8 billion, representing 4% of Indonesia's total GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. By 1997, Lim's net worth was $4 billion, making him the world's 68th richest man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

However, this economic boom was built on short-term external debts, primarily invested in domestic construction and real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. Indonesia's external debt doubled from $70 billion in 1990 to $140 billion by mid-1997, with the majority borrowed by the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

## The [[impact_of_the_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | Asian Financial Crisis]] and Suharto's Fall

On July 2, 1997, Thailand floated its currency, triggering a contagion effect across Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. Despite having better macroeconomic fundamentals, Indonesia was not immune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. Capital rapidly exited the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. Bank Indonesia, lacking sufficient reserves, loosened the Rupiah's trading band in July and floated it in August, causing it to lose over 30% of its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. This devaluation severely impacted Indonesian banks, as their foreign-denominated debt soared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. Intense competition from the 1989 banking reforms, coupled with high non-performing loans, meant many banks were insolvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

In October 1997, 16 commercial banks closed, leading to bank runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. BCA also experienced a run due to rumors, costing it $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) intervened in October 1997 with a $33 billion bailout package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. The bailout came with stringent economic reform conditions, including disassembling state and private monopolies, cutting subsidies, and further opening the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. These demands eventually led to Suharto's downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.

While Indonesia's economy grew 4.6% in 1997, it contracted by a staggering 13% in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. Sectors like construction (down 37%), finance (down 26.6%), and manufacturing (down 11%) collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. Millions lost their jobs, facing skyrocketing food and living costs exacerbated by a weak currency and drought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. The IMF's reforms targeted monopolies dominated by Suharto's cronies and family, hitting his supporters when he needed them most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. Suharto resisted, stating that the crisis was due to currency manipulation, not internal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. Relations with the IMF deteriorated, and the fund withheld payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

In May 1998, mass riots erupted in response to fuel subsidy cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. Many of these riots specifically targeted [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_chinese_businesses_in_indonesia | ethnic Chinese]] and their businesses, causing millions in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. A massive pro-democracy student demonstration demanded Suharto's resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. With his cabinet abandoning him, Suharto resigned on May 21, 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

## Aftermath and Legacy

Lim was out of Indonesia during the riots, having mostly relocated to Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. His home was attacked and set on fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. His son, Anthony Salim, evacuated the country, paying bribes to bypass roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | BCA]] and other [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] companies suffered fire damage, but the real blow came from the bank's association with the government crony, leading to a "Titanic run" on BCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. BCA collapsed, forcing the central bank to take over its $5 billion in debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

With a new president and political environment, the massive and largely insolvent [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Empire]] began to break apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. Many of BCA's debts were to other [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] companies, threatening them all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. Despite popular fury, Anthony Salim negotiated a settlement: [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] handed over stakes in over 100 Indonesian businesses, like Indocement and Indomobile, to repay the $5 billion government bailout for BCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. Crucially, [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim]] managed to retain a 50.1% share in [[indofoods_expansion_into_african_markets | Indofood]], moving these holdings offshore to the family's First Pacific financial company in Hong Kong through complex transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. [[indofoods_expansion_into_african_markets | Indofood]] has since become one of the world's biggest food companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.

Lim never returned to Indonesia after 1998, dying peacefully in Singapore in 2012 at the age of 95, with an estimated net worth of $655 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. Despite the collapse of much of his empire, his strategic moves ensured his family's continued wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. Lim was seen as the right person who made the right friends at the right time, outperforming other Chinese business partners of Suharto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. [[economic_and_political_dynamics_in_indonesia_during_suhartos_presidency | Suharto's governance]] did bring substantial economic benefits, with 32 years of 7% annual economic growth and the development of agricultural and manufacturing bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. However, this growth also significantly enriched Suharto, his cronies, and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

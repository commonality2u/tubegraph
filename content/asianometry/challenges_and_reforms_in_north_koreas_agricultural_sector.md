The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), or North Korea, has long pursued a goal of self-sufficiency in food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, obtaining reliable information about the country, particularly regarding its agricultural sector, is challenging due to the government's lack of credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

Historically, the northern part of Korea was its industrial heartland, while the south served as its breadbasket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## [[impact_of_geography_and_climate_on_north_korean_agriculture | Geographic and Climatic Constraints]]

North Korea's geography presents significant challenges for agriculture. Approximately 80% of its land is composed of mountains and uplands with deep valleys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The majority of its 25 million people reside on the coastal plains and lowlands of the west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Only about 15% of the country's land is arable, though this is comparable to the global average of 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Most farms are concentrated on the west coast, where conditions are more favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

The cropping season is short, with harsh winters, and summers that are short, hot, humid, and rainy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. A significant 60% of the DPRK's rain falls between June and September, leaving the country vulnerable to droughts and floods at other times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. These extreme climate events are exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure and widespread deforestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Early [[economic_policies_and_their_influence_on_north_korean_agriculture | Economic Policies]] and Their Consequences

Upon its founding, the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) inherited an advanced industrialized society from the Japanese occupation government, with North Korea holding 72% of the peninsula's industrial capacity and over 90% of its hydroelectric capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The WPK regime seized much of this infrastructure, alongside land belonging to Korean landlords and Japanese colonialists, which was then [[historical_land_reforms_and_their_effects_on_food_production | redistributed to the peasantry]] in 1945-1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

The Korean War (1950-1953) devastated the peninsula, causing immense population upheaval and annihilating industrial infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. After the war, the DPRK turned to China and the Soviet Union for aid, leveraging their deteriorating relations to maximize concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

Domestically, North Korea adopted a centrally planned economy, suppressing markets in line with Soviet models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The state owned all businesses and land, establishing cooperatives and state farms where farmers were compelled to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The state then confiscated and distributed all food grown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This collectivization, pushed by Kim Il-sung to achieve [[north_koreas_quest_for_food_selfsufficiency | food self-reliance]] and distance from the Soviet Union, was criticized even by communist peers and led to food shortages by the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

In response, the government heavily promoted fertilizers, pesticides, tractors, and irrigation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. While yields stabilized, the agricultural sector became dangerously dependent on raw inputs like oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Economic Decline and Famine (1980s-1990s)

North Korea accumulated vast debts to its benefactors, leading the Soviets to withdraw subsidies in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. That same year, the DPRK instituted agricultural reforms, intensifying double cropping and fertilizer use, raising forests, reclaiming tidal land, and clearing hillsides to expand arable land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. However, these intense practices led to soil depletion and acidification, and the newly cleared land was marginal at best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

The collapse of the Soviet Union caused North Korea to lose its primary source of coal, oil, and steel, which had accounted for up to two-thirds of its two-way trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The loss of oil severely impacted fertilizer production and irrigation infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

The DPRK turned to China, which supplied 77% of its fuel and 68% of its food by 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. But by 1994, China, facing its own grain issues, reduced trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

*   **The Great Famine:**
    *   By 1993, some provinces were already experiencing famine conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   Rations were delayed or suspended in 1993, and by 1994, food shipments to four provinces were entirely ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
    *   In 1995, the government began coercive grain seizures and established prison camps for those foraging for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   Refugees pouring into China revealed horrific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
    *   Flooding in 1995 and 1996 in the western provinces, where most farms are located, collapsed terraces and silted fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. North Korea exaggerated the damage to solicit international aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
    *   International food aid helped, but not all reached those in need, leading to disputes and withdrawal of charitable organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
    *   The exact death toll from the famine remains uncertain, with estimates ranging from 220,000 to 3.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## Ongoing Agricultural Challenges

Even after the famine, North Korean farmers continue to face significant challenges:

*   **Deteriorating Soil Quality:**
    *   Aggressive plowing, tilling, and heavy reliance on chemical fertilizers have caused soil acidification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
    *   This interferes with the soil's ability to absorb air and water, and plants' nutrient uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
    *   Aggressive double cropping (planting multiple crops in the same area/year) has deteriorated the land's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
    *   Soils have a reddish hue due to a lack of organic matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
    *   Paddy rice yields in 2011 were 3.9 tons per hectare, significantly down from 8.0 tons in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
    *   Farmers are reluctant to rotate in legumes, which could improve soil fertility, due to fear of not meeting government production goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

*   **Lack of Technology and Resources:**
    *   Farmers lack adequate farming technology like tractors suited for smaller fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
    *   They are often unable to run or maintain technology due to shortages of energy or parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
    *   The country's inability to raise funds for purchases is a major factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
    *   North Korea blames American trade sanctions, though these acts predate the state and North Korea was removed from some restrictions in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

*   **Deforestation and Environmental Degradation:**
    *   Efforts to expand arable land involve cutting down trees on hillsides for terraces, including slopes above 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
    *   Satellite imagery shows one million hectares on slopes above 10 degrees cleared for cereals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
    *   Without trees, unpredictable rainfall easily washes away soil, creating silt rivers that damage growing capacity and worsen floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
    *   Floods have been more destructive since the 1980s when deforestation began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
    *   Deforestation also impacts energy generation; 77% of the rural population and 28% of the urban population rely on wood for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## Reforms and Distribution Changes

According to Nobel laureate Amartya Sen, famines occur not only due to crop failure but also due to collapsed food distribution networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. During the DPRK's central planning era, the state collected and distributed all harvests through a rationing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. During the great famine, oil shortages made distribution difficult, and the system collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

*   **Rise of Private Markets:** Ordinary North Koreans resorted to illegal private markets for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. These "black markets" are often run by women seeking to support their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. After the famine, the government, after initial crackdowns, formalized these markets, providing housing, facilities, and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Today, defectors indicate that most ordinary North Koreans obtain food from these markets and private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
*   **Private Plots:** After the famine, the government allowed households to own and cultivate private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. These small gardens, where people grow potatoes, corn, and vegetables, are well-cared for and have significantly improved the country's food security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Decentralization Attempts:** In 2012, the Kim Jong-un government initiated [[economic_policies_and_their_influence_on_north_korean_agriculture | economic policy changes]] to devolve more authority to lower levels, allowing collective farm workers more decision-making power in material and investment planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. While not as sweeping as China's agricultural reforms under Deng Xiaoping, this is considered a step forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. However, the extent and impact of these reforms remain unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Food Rationing System:** The government has attempted to revitalize the old food ration system, but defectors suggest it no longer provides rations to ordinary citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. The state still takes up to 70% of state farmers' harvests, suggesting that rations are primarily directed to political and economic elites to retain their support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

## Current State and Outlook

Kim Jong-un has repeatedly expressed a desire for the country to focus on improving people's lives through increased food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. However, his government has been vague on concrete policy solutions, often proposing ideas like a "seed revolution" or more double cropping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

While food distribution has improved and famine is no longer a major threat, North Korea's agricultural situation still falls short of [[north_koreas_quest_for_food_selfsufficiency | self-sufficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. The country's farms have suffered significant abuse and soil damage over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Fundamental agricultural changes are needed for the population to consistently have enough food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

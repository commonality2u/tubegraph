The Soviet Union's efforts to explore Mars between 1960 and 1973 were marked by significant challenges and consistent failures, especially when compared to NASA's successful Martian program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Despite their success with Venus missions, Mars proved to be a difficult frontier, with the Soviets losing the race to fly by, orbit, and safely land on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Early Ambitions and Setbacks

The Soviet space program began with high ambitions stemming from Sergei Korolev's dream of space exploration, initially spurred by Stalin's demand for a missile capable of reaching Western enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. After the successful launch of Sputnik in 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, Korolev proposed a vast program to send robot spacecraft to Mars and Venus, eventually aiming for crewed missions and colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

However, a fundamental challenge was the lack of knowledge about space travel, which was based mostly on theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Missions to Mars required significantly higher speeds and a new, more powerful four-stage R7 rocket, the 8K78 or Molniya, which only existed on paper in early 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

## Impact of Political Pressure and Manufacturing Flaws

[[impact_of_political_pressure_on_soviet_space_missions | Political pressure]] was a constant and often detrimental factor. In January 1960, Khrushchev expressed concern about the growing American space program and demanded a launch to Mars and Venus within the 1960 window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. This led to a rushed development cycle for the 1M spacecraft and the Molniya rocket, which Korolev's team had to build from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

This frantic pace resulted in severe manufacturing issues. Factories produced incorrect parts, and probes arrived in pieces, requiring extensive repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. Ground tests revealed problems with the lander's radio system and television cameras, forcing the removal of instruments like ultraviolet spectrographs and infrared spectrometers due to integration issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

The initial launches in October 1960 were catastrophic:
*   The first rocket suffered heavy vibrations during its second stage, breaking up over Eastern Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.
*   The second probe failed when the rocket's third stage didn't trigger due to a frozen kerosene leak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
These failures meant the newly built fourth stages were never even tested in space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

The **Molniya rocket** continued to be unreliable. Its lower stages suffered from manufacturing defects, and its critical fourth stage struggled to ignite in zero gravity, as engineers grappled with forcing free-floating fuel particles into tanks for ignition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

## The Cuban Missile Crisis and its Fallout

The Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a> directly interfered with the space program. Baikonur Spaceport, with only two launch pads, had to prioritize military intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) over civilian rockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. This caused delays and immense stress, with one official recalling armed soldiers on site and a near-miss where rocket debris was initially mistaken for a swarm of nuclear missiles by a US warning station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.

The Mars 1 probe, launched amidst this crisis, failed in Earth orbit due to issues with the troublesome fourth stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. It eventually lost contact before reaching Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

## Shifting Priorities and Managerial Chaos

After the US Mariner 4 successfully flew by Mars in July 1965, sending back groundbreaking photographs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>, enthusiasm for Mars missions waned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. The Politburo redirected resources to the [[historical_space_race_between_us_and_ussr | race to the Moon]] in August 1964, leading to "managerial chaos" within the Soviet space program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. Korolev, whose primary goal became a crewed Moon mission, reassigned the planetary robot program to the Lavochkin firm in March 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.

Korolev's death in January 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a> further impacted the program, as the new team at Lavochkin recognized fundamental flaws in previous Marscraft designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>.

## The M69 Program and Intense Pressure

The M69 project, initiated in 1969, aimed to surpass the US by soft-landing a probe and searching for microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. The new team discarded old designs and faced immense time pressure to meet the 1969 launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>.

Design and engineering challenges included:
*   Adapting lunar designs, which led to propulsion system issues and fuel leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>.
*   A risky decision by engineering head Georgie Babakin to scrap and redesign the entire probe just 13 months before launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.
*   Significant weight issues due to the lack of advanced semiconductor technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>.
*   An extremely complicated launch sequence involving multiple stages and engine firings, never before attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>.

The [[impact_of_political_pressure_on_soviet_space_missions | Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] exerted enormous pressure, issuing a special military-industrial resolution to ensure the 1969 launch date was met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>. Weekly updates were demanded, underperforming suppliers were blacklisted, and teams worked around the clock without overtime pay, driven by "enthusiasm for the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>.

Despite these efforts, both M69 probes failed catastrophically:
*   M69a exploded 438 seconds into launch due to a rotor failure in the rocket's third stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>.
*   M69b's right engine failed at launch, causing the rocket to fall back and explode, spewing toxic materials over the launch pad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:00">[20:46:00]</a>.

These failures, described as the "wrong way to run a space program," were particularly bitter given the US triumph with Apollo 11 and subsequent Mariner 6 and 7 missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>.

## The 1971 and 1973 Missions: Uncontrolled Entry and Flawed Components

The failure of M69 left the Soviets without the crucial atmospheric data needed for a soft landing on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:23:00">[22:23:00]</a>. They opted for a risky "uncontrolled ballistic entry" for their landers, akin to a "bullet punching through the sky," in contrast to the US's "controlled gliding type entry" which relied on superior atmospheric knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>. This approach put immense pressure on precise timing and hardware, including deploying a parachute at Mach 3.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:50:00">[25:50:00]</a>.

Further challenges included:
*   A critical operator coding error for the Mars 71S orbiter, which was supposed to gather atmospheric data. The fourth stage was mistakenly coded to fire at 150 hours instead of 1.5 hours, causing the rocket to stay in Earth orbit before crashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>.
*   The death of Lavochkin chief designer Georgie Babakin in August 1971, shortly before the Mars missions arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:00">[30:20:00]</a>.
*   A massive dust storm raging across Mars upon the probes' arrival, making landing even more hazardous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:43:00">[30:43:00]</a>.
*   Reliance on a backup optical navigation system for entry positioning due to the lost orbiter. Untested computer programs for this system led to Mars 2 entering the atmosphere at the wrong angle and crashing before parachute deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:00">[31:14:00]</a>.
*   Mars 3 successfully landed, but its television camera system failed after just 14.5 seconds, sending back only 79 lines of a single, unclear photograph. Theories suggest electrical discharges from dust or a fabricated transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>.

The 1973 "all-out assault" on Mars faced a critical, systemic flaw: widespread use of faulty 2T312 transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00:00">[36:00:00]</a>. The manufacturer, either due to material shortage or cost reasons, replaced specified gold leads with aluminum ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:22:00">[36:22:00]</a>. These aluminum leads corroded rapidly, leading to a 50/50 chance of catastrophic failure after 1.5 years of production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:44:00">[36:44:00]</a>. Despite knowing this, the ministry decided to proceed, facing political pressure and the looming 1975 Viking mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:12:00">[37:12:00]</a>.

This flaw led to more failures:
*   Mars 4 flew by Mars without entering orbit, likely due to a faulty brake system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:32:00">[37:32:00]</a>.
*   Mars 7 released its lander, but transistor failures in its computer caused it to miss the planet entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:01:00">[38:01:00]</a>.
*   Mars 5 successfully orbited but suffered a slow pressure leak, forcing ground control to compress its three-month science program into three weeks before it failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:20:00">[38:20:00]</a>.
*   Mars 6, despite losing telemetry data early, autonomously navigated to Mars and released its entry probe, but the lander failed to safely transmit on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:06:00">[39:06:00]</a>.

## Conclusion and Legacy

Despite these "[[technological_advancements_and_failures_in_soviet_mars_missions | technological advancements and failures in Soviet Mars missions]]" and [[impact_of_bureaucratic_infighting_on_soviet_technological_advancements | bureaucratic infighting]] that led to the dismissal of chief designer Vasili Mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:32:00">[40:32:00]</a>, the Soviet space program continued for a time. Resources were pivoted towards Venus, where they had a clear advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:19:00">[41:19:00]</a>. A final attempt to explore the Martian moon Phobos in 1989 also failed due to faulty commands and computer errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:39:00">[41:39:00]</a>.

Ultimately, the Soviet Mars program was defined by its intense [[competition_between_soviet_union_and_united_states_in_space_exploration | competition with the United States]]. While this political importance granted them substantial resources, the arduous political requirements, limited launch windows, poor execution, and plain bad luck largely foiled Soviet success on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:00">[42:01:00]</a>. Their achievements were eclipsed by the US, but their incredible efforts to send 15 robots millions of kilometers into space should be admired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:28:00">[42:28:00]</a>.

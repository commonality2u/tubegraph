The current state of Russia's semiconductor industry necessitates a look back into [[soviet_computer_development_history | Soviet history]] for context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## The Soviet Technology Gap
The [[Soviet Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> suffered from a massive [[challenges_in_russian_semiconductor_manufacturing | technology gap]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> in [[soviet_computer_development_history | computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> and [[soviet_computer_development_history | advanced electronics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> compared to the United States, a gap that began as early as the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This disparity was rooted in ideology, technology, and geopolitics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

By the time of the Soviet collapse in 1991, the country faced a severe shortage of sufficiently powerful integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The collective computing power of all [[soviet_computer_development_history | computers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> in the country was still two generations behind a single American Cray supercomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Post-Soviet Legacy
The collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> fragmented its scientific industrial complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Russia inherited 96% of the vacuum electronics production facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. However, the most [[history_of_semiconductor_development_in_europe | advanced semiconductor production facilities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> were located in other Soviet-bloc countries like [[east_germanys_semiconductor_industry_in_the_1980s | East Germany]], Belarus, and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Post-collapse Russian industrial policy further exacerbated this issue by moving away from domestic electronics, increasing the country's reliance on imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Key Soviet-Era Semiconductor Manufacturers

### Micron Group
*   **Founding:** The company's roots trace back to 1964, when it was established as the Research Institute for Molecular Electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Early Achievements:** Its plant was the first in the country to successfully produce an integrated circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Production (1970s-1980s):** Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the plant manufactured microprocessors for applications such as air defense and the Venus space programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **"Big Three":** Micron, along with Angstrom of Russia and Integral of Belarus, formed the [[russian_domestic_semiconductor_companies_and_their_developments | Soviet Union's "big three" IC manufacturers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Angstrom
*   **Founding:** Angstrom was founded in 1963 as the Research Institute of Precision Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Key Development:** The company was known for developing and producing the "Electronics NTS 8010," which was the [[soviet_computer_development_history | Soviet Union's first completely domestic computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **"Big Three":** Angstrom was also part of the [[russian_domestic_semiconductor_companies_and_their_developments | Soviet Union's "big three" IC manufacturers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Integral (Belarus)
*   **Founding:** Integral, located in Belarus, was launched in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
*   **Significance:** It was the third of the [[russian_domestic_semiconductor_companies_and_their_developments | "big three" Soviet semiconductor manufacturers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, producing a variety of electronics products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. A significant portion of [[soviet_computer_development_history | Soviet integrated circuit production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> was located in Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

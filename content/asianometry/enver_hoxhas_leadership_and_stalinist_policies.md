Enver Hoxha led the People's Republic of Albania, which was described as the most isolated country in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, this small Communist country remarkably managed to join and then split with three different major Communist powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. After its third and final split, Albania ferociously pursued economic self-reliance, which made it the third poorest country in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This article explores the rise and fall of [[communist_albanias_isolation_and_political_dynamics | Communist Albania]] under Hoxha's leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Rise to Power

Enver Hoxha was the son of a Muslim clothing merchant, growing up in an ordinary family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Although an average student without obvious talents, his uncle helped him gain admission to the prestigious Albanian National Lyceum in Korca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. He showed a talent for politics and a desire for power, and was easily underestimated, which contributed to his future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. After incomplete university studies in France and some time in Brussels, he returned to Albania as a teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. He became a Communist at some point before then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

Hoxha was present at the founding of the Communist Party of Albania in 1941, which was initiated by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia to unify small, scattered parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Despite initial refusals from group leaders to accept a single leader, a Central Committee was set up for collective leadership, and Hoxha was selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. He quickly dominated the committee, eventually leading to the jailing or execution of the rest of his peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

During World War II, the Communist Party of Albania, advised by the Yugoslavs, formed the National Liberation Movement by preaching national liberation rather than economic Marxist-Leninism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. They launched guerrilla attacks against the Italians, hoping violent reprisals would radicalize more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. After a brief, failed agreement with the National Front (Nationalists) and the latter's alliance with Germany, the Communists under Hoxha returned fiercely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. In November 1944, they marched into Tirana, winning the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Albania remains the only country in Central or Eastern Europe "liberated" without Allied help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Consolidation of Power

Immediately after taking power, Hoxha's provisional government purged opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Koci Xoxe, the Minister of the Interior, led a brutal purge targeting elites, anti-communists from the interwar years, and "enemies of the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Nearly 2,000 people were executed in sham tribunals, and others were sent to one of 39 newly built jails, often in remote areas, forced to work in mines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

The Party established a secret police, the Directorate of State Security or Sigurimi. At its peak, the Sigurimi had over 200,000 workers, keeping millions of files on people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

In December 1945, Albania held "free" elections where Communists were the only candidates and won 90% of the vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. A month later, Hoxha abolished the monarchy and declared the country a "People's Republic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Stalinist Policies and Economic Isolation

Hoxha's leadership was characterized by a fervent commitment to Stalinist policies, particularly after his break with Yugoslavia.

### Shift to Stalinism

After 1948, Albania severed ties with Yugoslavia and joined [[role_of_comecon_and_soviet_influence_on_bulgaria | COMECON]], entering the Soviet orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. From 1949 to 1951, all of Albania's trade was with COMECON states, with the Soviet Union accounting for half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. The Soviets provided significant food and military aid, totaling about $200 million between 1948 and 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. They also transferred technologies and built infrastructure like airfields and a submarine base on Sazan island, which was a major strategic asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

Hoxha developed an immense personal admiration for Stalin, publishing a book about their meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. He was genuine in his fervor for a Stalinist economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

### Stalinist Economy

Going Stalinist meant building a completely centrally-planned socialist economy where the government decided all economic aspects, laid out in grand 5-year plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. This policy emphasized the collectivization of agriculture and the rapid build-up of heavy industry at the cost of consumer products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

Collectivization of agriculture proceeded slower due to limited arable land, but by 1956, 696 collective farms covered 40% of the land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Party officials had to exert "greater force" to ensure labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

In 1951, the Albanian government completed its transition to a centrally planned economy with its first 5-Year Plan, setting all prices, production levels, investment, and wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. This Stalinist-style economy created strange contradictions and shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. Employment was guaranteed, but job choice was absent, and failure to meet goals led to labor camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Despite new factories and luxury goods in stores, food shortages were severe, with less meat consumed in 1953 than in 1949, and rationing continuing until 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

### Cult of Personality and Repression

After Stalin's death in 1953, Hoxha publicly mourned him, making thousands kneel in Tirana's largest square to take an eternal oath to their "beloved father" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. Albanians, watched by the Secret Police, rubbed onions on children's eyes to feign grief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

When Albania broke ties with the Soviet Union due to Khrushchev's de-Stalinization and reconciliation with Tito <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, and later with China over its overtures to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>, Hoxha tightened his surveillance state and ramped up his own cult of personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. Every photograph of him was scrutinized, depicting him immaculately combed and smiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

### Self-Reliance

When shortages intensified in the mid-1960s, the Party focused heavily on "self-reliance," a fundamental concept in Stalinist economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. After the final break with China, the Albanian government promoted the idea that foreign powers sought to exploit them through "economic blockades and encirclement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. Hoxha declared Albania the only country still building socialism and revamped the 1976 Constitution to enshrine self-reliance, granting him unlimited power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

For the next 12 years, the country operated without foreign aid or credit, and Albanian companies were forbidden from joint ventures with foreign countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. Religion was banned, and people were forbidden from traveling abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

This policy had several points of emphasis:
*   **Exports for Hard Currency**: Albania ramped up exports, primarily oil, chromite, copper, and electricity, to acquire hard currency for needed investment goods from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. They diversified trade partners, including a semi-relaxation of relations with Yugoslavia and COMECON (excluding the Soviet Union) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **Economic Data Control**: The government closely controlled economic data, releasing only positive statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.
*   **Food Self-Sufficiency**: The country aimed for self-sufficiency in food production by draining swamps to expand arable land from 391,000 hectares in 1950 to 713,000 in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. In 1976, Albania claimed to have achieved self-sufficiency in bread grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

Despite these efforts, the policy led to [[albanias_economic_strategies_and_selfreliance | economic stagnation and decay]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. Technological backwardness was severe; old equipment from Soviets and Chinese broke down, and engineers attempted costly self-repairs instead of buying new parts from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

### Life Under Isolation

The self-reliance policy resulted in significant hardship for the population:
*   **Rationing**: Families received minimal rations of meat (1 kg), butter (250g), and eggs (7) per week, regardless of size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. The average monthly wage in 1984 was $15, and people could not even keep their own livestock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure**: Even in Tirana, the capital, water and electricity were only available for a few hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. Four to ten people lived in a single 50 square meter flat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. Roads were in a sorry state, and technology was decades behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.
*   **Border Control**: Anyone attempting to leave was shot on sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. Jamming devices were installed at borders to prevent foreign influence, and 64% of the coasts were military zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>. Over 45 years, about 1,200 people, mostly under 30, were killed trying to escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

## Later Years and Death

Hoxha was a longtime smoker and diabetic, suffering heart attacks in 1972 and 1973, which reduced his political activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. In 1980, he chose Ramiz Alia as his successor, purging and possibly executing his long-time partner, Prime Minister Mehmet Shehu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. Alia gradually gained decision-making power as Hoxha receded into a "lonely semi-retirement," largely adhering to Hoxha's line of economic isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.

In 1983, an aged and frail Hoxha declared victory, claiming significant increases in social product and national income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. He spent his final years writing 13 memoirs, romanticizing his youth and achievements, in "total ignorance of the economic disaster developing around him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. He died in April 1985 after collapsing into a coma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.

## Legacy

Hoxha's declaration of economic success was contradicted by the reality of deep and prolonged economic stagnation after 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. Throughout the 1980s, Albania's economy grew at an average of 1.7%, effectively zeroed out in the second half of the decade, leading to a decrease in average Albanian wealth given a 2% population growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

Hoxha's pursuit of total economic self-reliance led the country down a path of "anti-development and into madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>. After his death, his successor Alia attempted gradual reforms, but these were insufficient to halt the collapse of the [[albanias_transition_from_communism | Communist government]] by 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. The people tore down Hoxha's statues, and in March 1992, the Democratic Party won power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>. While Albania underwent one of the fastest transitions to capitalism after 1992, a profound need for further economic reform remains today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.

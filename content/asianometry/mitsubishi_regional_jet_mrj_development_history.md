From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 
The [[Mitsubishi Regional Jet MRJ development history|Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ)]], later rebranded as the SpaceJet, was Japan's first indigenous commercial aircraft in nearly half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. After six delays, over ten years of development, and nearly nine billion dollars spent, Mitsubishi announced in October 2020 that development on the SpaceJet M90 would be paused, and 95% of Mitsubishi Aircraft employees would be laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. The subsidiary, Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation, became insolvent and now operates with a skeleton crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Historical Context: Japan's Aviation Industry

Before World War II, Japan had a thriving aircraft industry with companies like Mitsubishi, Hitachi, Fuji, and Kawasaki producing planes primarily for the military at the government's behest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. However, [[Japans aviation industry postWorld War II|industrial development was halted after Japan lost World War II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This delay caused Japan to fall behind in the generational technology shift from propeller planes to jets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Since the industry had previously serviced the government, none of the companies were commercially competitive or had experience selling to airliners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Japan's only significant attempt at building a commercial plane after the war was the NAMC YS-11, a turboprop airliner that first flew in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The Japanese [[MITIs role in Japans computer and software industry development|Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)]] encouraged a consortium of Japanese companies to design and build it to replace Douglas DC-3s on domestic routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The YS-11 was produced for a decade, selling about 161 units before shutting down in 1974, incurring a $600 million loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Despite its commercial [[failures and challenges in japanese commercial aircraft industry|failure]], the YS-11 experience allowed Japan to enter Boeing's supplier network, with the country eventually contributing 35% of an average Boeing 787, including critical parts like main wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## The Regional Jet Market

Commercial air travel is typically serviced by three types of planes: large jets (100+ passengers), smaller turboprop planes, and regional jets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Regional jets sit in the middle, usually maxing out at about 100 passengers and capable of flying farther than turboprops, often used in the United States to connect passengers to major hub-and-spoke airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The first regional jets arrived in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. While the British Aerospace 146 was a pioneer, the market was soon dominated by Canada's Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Recently, new competition has emerged from Russia's Sukhoi Superjet 100 and China's Comac ARJ21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Industry watchers in Japan saw an opportunity in this growing market (before 2019) to establish themselves in a flagship technology space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Launch of the Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) Program

In 2003, the modern-day Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) initiated a five-year, $400 million program to study an indigenous regional jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The initial plan for 30-50 seats was upscaled to 70-90 seats after market analysis projected significantly larger demand for this category (4,500+ units) over the next 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) was selected to lead the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. They exhibited a concept in 2007 and officially launched the program in 2008, founding the Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation subsidiary alongside Toyota and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Although MHI had not developed a commercial plane since the MC-20 in 1940, it was Japan's largest military supplier with experience producing fighter jets and a critical supplier to Boeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This experience gave the Japanese confidence in their ability to build their own plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Mitsubishi aimed for a 20% market share of the 4,500+ unit 70-90 seat regional jet market, planning two specifications: the MRJ90 (85-90 people) and the MRJ70 (70-80 people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The jet was positioned as a high-tech, stylish, and comfortable passenger jet with spacious bins and large windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Designed for fuel efficiency (20-30% reduction over competitors), it was dubbed the "world's greenest craft," a critical feature given high oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The Japanese government contributed hundreds of millions in subsidies for distinguishing technologies, such as carbon composite molding and advanced aerodynamic design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Development Milestones and Challenges

The MRJ needed to achieve three milestones: finalize design, build the supply chain and manufacture (culminating in first flight), and pass flight tests for certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The original 2008 plan targeted a 2013 launch date, with a development cost of about $1.3 billion and a need to sell 300-400 units to pay back these costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Mitsubishi eventually received orders from Japan Airlines (JAL), ANA, and U.S. airlines SkyWest and Eastern Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Efforts to secure orders from Japanese government entities like the Coast Guard were unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

To meet the 2013 launch, the first airplane needed to be ready for flight tests by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Delay 1: Design Change (September 2009)
The initial design featured drastically swept-back wings made significantly from carbon-based composite materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. However, in September 2009, the design changed, with the main wings to be made of aluminum, reducing the plane's composite percentage from 30% to 10-15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. The reasons for this [[impact of supply chain and design changes on aircraft development|design change]] are not entirely clear, but potential factors include a lack of slack in the supply chain (e.g., Toray's capacity to deliver complex composites) or design-related concerns about composite durability against high-impact forces during frequent takeoffs and landings, common for regional jets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This first delay pushed the first flight to Q2 2012 and deliveries to early 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Boeing's Role and Domestic Sourcing
Mitsubishi and Boeing have a long-standing alliance, partly due to political requirements for Boeing to allocate production to Japanese manufacturers (technology transfer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Boeing considered investing in Mitsubishi Aircraft but instead offered strategic and technical consultation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Boeing saw the MRJ as a potential replacement for their 737s for airlines like ANA and a way to deepen their involvement in a critical Japanese market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

In 2010, a Boeing executive suggested Mitsubishi Aircraft use the 737 cockpit for the MRJ, which could have saved time and costs by leveraging Boeing's global supply network and pilot familiarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. However, Japanese government policy required at least 30% domestic sourcing, similar to China's ARJ21, making Boeing's cockpit offer challenging to integrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Regardless, Mitsubishi locked the design in 2010, and assembly began in April 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### Delay 2: Supply Chain Network (April 2012)
Over the next three years, Mitsubishi struggled to build its supply network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. A single plane has about a million precise and difficult-to-manufacture parts, often made by a small group of suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Unlike Boeing, who gets parts when they want them, Mitsubishi faced waiting times and higher costs—sometimes double what Boeing paid for a part—due to a lack of economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. This led to the second program delay in April 2012, pushing the first flight to Q3 2013 and deliveries to mid-2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

Despite the delays, SkyWest Airlines, the largest regional airline in North America, placed a significant order for 100 MRJ90s with an option for another 100, a $4.2 billion deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. However, the high cost of parts meant Mitsubishi had to raise its sales target from 1,000 to 1,500 units, with a break-even point of 750 planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. By this point, the MRJ had collected orders for about 407 planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

### Delay 3: Supply Partner Collaboration (August 2013)
In August 2013, the company announced its third production delay, needing more time to work with supply partners, pushing first delivery back two more years to mid-2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### Rollout and First Flight
In October 2014, Mitsubishi held its rollout ceremony, signaling the completed assembly of the first plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This was a major event for Japan, with executives and government officials attending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. The first flight took place a year later in November 2015 at Nagoya Airport, appearing successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

### Delay 4: Certification Schedule Review (2015)
Despite the successful first flight, significant work remained for customer deliveries, including internal flight tests (dozens of flights with five craft) and type certification flights (at least 2,500 hours, mostly in the U.S.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Officials would assess compliance with nearly 400 line items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. After reviewing the overall schedule, Mitsubishi decided a fourth delay was necessary, pushing first deliveries to Q3 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Critically, this would put the MRJ's release around the same time as Embraer's E2 series, which used the same Pratt & Whitney engine, eliminating the MRJ's initial 20% fuel consumption advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. By 2016, the MRJ program budget had ballooned to nearly $3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

### Delay 5: Wiring Documentation (2016)
Two years of flight tests were challenging, with frequent misinterpretations and a lack of proper documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. Engineers had adopted their own approaches, particularly in electric wiring, directly leading to delay number five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Following the TWA Flight 800 explosion in 1996, the FAA tightened aircraft wiring certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. Mitsubishi knew about this, but due to a lack of documentation, they couldn't explain their wire design to regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Rather than reworking 23,000 wires individually, the company decided to redo the entire wiring system, which was tantamount to a total internal redesign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This pushed delivery dates to mid-2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

Four of the five delays were attributed to a "sloppy lack of documentation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. In response, Mitsubishi changed its organizational structure, hired more foreign engineers with aviation experience, and gave them decision-making power. MHI President Miyanaga took more direct control of the subsidiary, and its president retired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. By this point, it seemed unlikely the program would ever be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

## Rebranding and Final Delay

In June 2019, Mitsubishi rebranded the MRJ as the Mitsubishi SpaceJet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. The MRJ90 became the SpaceJet M90, and the MRJ70 was reworked into the SpaceJet M100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. This change was in response to concerns from major U.S. regional airline customers like SkyWest and Trans States Holdings (TSH), who together held 70% of the order book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. These airlines operate under unionized major airlines with "scope clauses" that influence aircraft seat numbers and maximum takeoff weight to protect pilots' earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Modifying the MRJ70 to the M100 naturally impacted the delivery schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

### Delay 6: New Design Certification (January 2020)
In late January 2020, Mitsubishi announced its sixth delay, pushing deliveries from mid-2020 to 2021 or beyond, because the new plane design could not acquire the necessary certification before then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

## Program Freezing

Concurrently, the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact global air travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. In March 2020, a SpaceJet M90 unit's type certification flight was delayed due to pandemic lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. In May 2020, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries reported its first quarterly loss in 20 years, and Mitsubishi halved its SpaceJet development plan, postponing production, reducing personnel, and closing U.S. development centers, moving work back to Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

A few months later, in October 2020, the company announced a three-year medium-term management plan that effectively paused all development of the SpaceJet M90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. 95% of employees at Mitsubishi Aircraft were laid off, with the company only maintaining certification documentation while waiting for an anticipated air travel recovery in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

## Conclusion

The SpaceJet's odyssey highlights the immense difficulty of building cutting-edge commercial aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. While the program made progress from 2003 to 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>, it faced numerous challenges, particularly in documentation, supply chain, and [[global_competitiveness_in_regional_jet_manufacturing|global competitiveness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Compared to China's ARJ21, which made its maiden flight six years after its program start and commercial flight eight years later, the SpaceJet was on a similar timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. However, the pandemic and the subsequent liquidation and pause mean a massive loss of experience, talent, and resources. The program is functionally dead, and reviving it would require significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

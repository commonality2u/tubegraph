From 1960 to 1973, the [[soviet_mars_missions_from_1960_to_1973 | Soviet Union]] launched 15 probes and orbiters to Mars, struggling to match NASA's successful Martian program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While they excelled in [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venus exploration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, they lost the race to fly by, orbit, and safely land on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This article examines the design and the myriad challenges faced by the [[soviet_mars_missions_from_1960_to_1973 | Soviet Mars program]].

## Origins of the Soviet Space Program

The foundation for the [[soviet_mars_missions_from_1960_to_1973 | Soviet Mars program]] was laid in 1950 when Stalin tasked Sergey Korolev with developing a missile capable of striking Western enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Korolev, who began his career with gliders before moving to rockets, was instrumental in reverse-engineering German V2 rocket designs in the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. He eventually delivered the R7 missile, which was successfully fired in 1957 after Stalin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Stalin's passing eased the political climate, allowing Korolev to pursue his dream of space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. He envisioned rockets for reaching the Moon, [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venus]], and Mars, not merely military toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. In January 1956, the Politburo approved the development of an artificial satellite, Object D, later known as Sputnik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. After three failed attempts, Sputnik was successfully put into orbit on October 4, 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The unexpected success of Sputnik caused a sensation in the West, prompting American political elites to seek to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Capitalizing on Sputnik's success, Korolev and his team proposed a vast new space program in 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This program aimed to send robot spacecraft to Mars and [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venus]], upgrade the R7 into a three-stage rocket, and eventually develop a four-stage R7 capable of sending humans to the Moon, [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venus]], and Mars, with the ultimate goal of establishing colonies on these planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. While initial resources were focused on lunar probes, Mars was considered the "real prize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Early Mars Missions (1960-1965)

### Project 1M (1960)
The first dedicated [[soviet_mars_missions_from_1960_to_1973 | Mars missions]], Project 1M, were conceived under pressure from Khrushchev to launch within the 1960 orbital window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Design:** The two 1M spacecraft were approximately 2 meters long, 1 meter wide, and weighed about 640 kilograms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. They were to be launched by a new, more powerful four-stage R7 rocket, the 8K78 or Molnia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Instruments included a radiometer, charged particle detector, and a spectro-reflectometer for detecting life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Challenges:** The Molnia rocket's fourth stage had to be built from scratch in a rushed effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Factories produced faulty components, forcing extensive repairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Instrument integration issues led to the removal of a UV spectrograph, TV system, and infrared spectrometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
    *   The first 1M rocket (Mars 1M No.1) launched on October 10, 1960, but suffered heavy vibrations in the second stage, breaking up over Eastern Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
    *   The second probe (Mars 1M No.2) failed to reach space due to a frozen kerosene leak in the third stage, breaking up in the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. These failures meant the new fourth stages were never even tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### 2MV Series (1962) & Mars 1
Following the 1M failures, Korolev's team launched [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venus probes]] (1V series) similar to the 1M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Venera 1 became Humanity's first true interplanetary spacecraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This experience fed into the 2MV project for both [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venus]] and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Design:** The six 2MV probes (three for Mars) weighed around 900 kilograms, measuring 3.3 meters long and 1 meter in diameter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. They carried large cameras and instruments for detecting life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Challenges:** The Molnia rocket continued to be unreliable, with manufacturing issues in its lower stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. The critical fourth stage struggled to ignite in zero gravity due to free-floating fuel particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
    *   The first 2MV Mars probe (2MV-4 No.1, or Sputnik 22) launched on October 24, 1962, amidst the Cuban Missile Crisis, but failed in Earth orbit due to the problematic fourth stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.
    *   Mars 1 (originally 2MV No.4, or Sputnik 23) launched on November 1, 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. It unfurled its solar panels successfully, but a gas engine in the orientation system began leaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Contact was lost on March 21, 1963, a few months before its arrival at Mars, preventing any data transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

### Zon Series (1964) & Zon 2
Following the 2MV series, new improvements were attempted with the Zon series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Design:** Similar to 1M probes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Challenges:** Zon 2, intended for Mars and launched in November 1964, suffered fatal onboard failures, including a solar panel failing to unfurl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. This failure was compounded by the success of the American Mariner 4, which flew by Mars in July 1965 and sent back 22 photographs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Mariner 4's images showed Mars to be a cold, dead world, dampening enthusiasm for future [[soviet_mars_missions_from_1960_to_1973 | Mars missions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

## Reorganization and Renewed Efforts (Late 1960s)

The consistent failures and the intensifying [[comparison_of_soviet_and_american_space_programs | race to the Moon]] led to significant changes in the [[soviet_space_exploration_achievements_and_failures | Soviet space program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Korolev's primary focus shifted to the Moon mission, and in March 1965, the responsibility for robotic planetary missions was reassigned to Lavochkin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Korolev passed away less than a year later in January 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

The new team at Lavochkin recognized fundamental flaws in previous Marscraft designs, partly due to the previous agency (OKB-1) being spread too thin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. They decided to surpass Mariner 4 by aiming for a soft landing on Mars and searching for microorganisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. In October 1965, the program was rebooted, meaning they would miss the 1967 Mars launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

### Project M69 (1969)
The new project, M69, abandoned the old 3MV Zon designs. This was partly for a fresh start and partly because Mariner 4 showed the Martian atmosphere was too thin for existing Lander designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **Design:** The M69 probes leveraged the new UR-500, or Proton, rocket, which could send 4 to 5 metric tons on an interplanetary trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. The initial plan involved a Mars Orbiter and Lander, but due to time constraints, the Lander was removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. The design eventually centered on a single spherical tank with an engine, antenna, solar panels, and instrumentation packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. M69 carried three color cameras and was the first Soviet planetary device with an onboard computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. The design ballooned to 4,850 kg, mostly fuel, due to a lack of advanced semiconductor technology for shrinking instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   **Challenges:** The mission involved an extremely complicated launch sequence: a three-stage Proton rocket to Earth orbit, then a fourth stage firing, followed by the M69 probe firing its own propulsion engine multiple times for trajectory adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. This had never been attempted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.
    *   The Communist Party imposed immense political pressure, demanding weekly updates and blacklisting underperforming suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. Teams worked around the clock without overtime pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
    *   The first M69 probe (M69a), launched on March 27, 1969, exploded 438 seconds into the launch due to a rotor failure in the rocket's third stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.
    *   The second probe (M69b), launched on April 2, 1969, failed at launch due to an engine failure in its first stage, causing it to fall back and explode, spewing toxic materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.
    *   These failures, combined with the successful Apollo 11 Moon landing and Mariner 6 and 7 Mars flybys in July 1969, were a bitter defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

## 1971 Mars Missions (M71 Series)

Despite the failures, the Soviets aimed for the 1971 Mars launch window, a special year when the planets were very close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. Lacking atmospheric data from previous failures, they decided to send three probes: one Orbiter to collect data and two Landers that would use that data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.
*   **Design:**
    *   **M71S (Orbiter):** Named Mars 71s (S for Sputnik/Orbiter), it was launched as early as possible without a Lander but with 800 kg more fuel for faster transit to Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. Its purpose was to measure the planet's atmosphere for the Landers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.
    *   **M71P (Lander):** Named Mars 71p (P for Possadka/Lander), these probes would arrive later and use the Orbiter's data to calculate the correct entry trajectory for soft landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. Unlike the Americans, who used controlled gliding entry, the Soviets had to use an "uncontrolled ballistic entry" due to lack of atmospheric data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. The entry probe was designed to be released 46,000 km above Mars, fire engines for position, enter at a 120-degree angle to deploy a parachute at 35 km altitude while traveling at Mach 3.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. A radio altimeter and soft landing engine would control descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. The Lander would open up to expose instruments, take measurements, and snap pictures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. A small rover, the Prop-M Marsokhodnik (10x10 inches), designed to "walk" on two skis and measure ground density, was also part of the plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.
*   **Challenges:**
    *   **M71S (Mars 2):** Launched on May 9, 1971, a critical coding error in the launch sequence caused the rocket's fourth stage to be programmed to fire at 150 hours instead of 1.5 hours, preventing it from leaving Earth orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
    *   **M71P (Mars 2 and 3):** The loss of the Orbiter meant the Landers would lack crucial atmospheric data for precise entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. This was exacerbated by Mariner 9 successfully orbiting Mars first and reporting a massive dust storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.
        *   Mars 2 (a Lander) arrived on November 27, 1971. Its onboard computer programs misinterpreted data, causing the entry probe to enter at the wrong angle and crash before parachute deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>. It was, however, the first Earth-made object to reach the Martian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
        *   Mars 3 (a Lander) arrived on December 2, 1971, executing its instructions, and the landing sequence (parachute and Lander drop) went as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>. It landed successfully amidst the Martian dust storm and began transmitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">[00:32:16]</a>. However, only 14.5 seconds after starting, its television camera system failed, sending only 79 lines of a single photograph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. The reason for failure is unclear, with theories ranging from electric discharges from dust to a fabricated transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. No clear image of the Martian surface was obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

## 1973 Mars Missions: An All-Out Assault

Despite previous setbacks, the [[soviet_space_exploration_achievements_and_failures | Soviet leadership]] planned an "all-out assault" on Mars for the 1973 launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. This was partly driven by the impending American Viking missions in 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>.
*   **Design:** The plan evolved from two Orbiter-Landers to two Orbiters and two Landers, due to the less ideal orbital window requiring more speed and fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. The four spacecraft (Mars 4, 5, 6, 7) largely adopted the designs of the M71 devices (Mars 2 and 3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.
*   **Challenges:** A fundamental flaw was discovered during the integration phase: widespread failures in the Power Systems due to faulty 2T312 transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. The transistors, specified to have gold leads, were instead fabricated with aluminum leads, causing corrosion and failure after about 1.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. Engineers estimated a 50/50 chance of catastrophic failure before mission completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. The ministry proceeded with the launch due to political pressure and the looming Viking mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.
    *   **Mars 4 (Orbiter):** Flew by Mars on February 10, 1974, without entering orbit, likely due to a failure in the disproportionate brake system related to the faulty transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. It took some photos before entering solar orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.
    *   **Mars 7 (Lander):** Reached Mars on March 9, 1974, and released its Lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. However, transistor failures in the Lander's computer systems caused it to miss the planet by about 1,300 kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.
    *   **Mars 5 (Orbiter):** Successfully entered Martian orbit in February 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>. A slow pressure leak in the sealed instrument module forced ground control to accelerate its three-month science program to just three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>. It took 108 high-resolution images and studied the atmosphere, detecting water vapor and an ozone layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. This mission was largely considered accomplished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.
    *   **Mars 6 (Lander):** About two months after its September 1973 launch, Mars 6 lost the ability to send telemetry data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. Remarkably, it autonomously measured its position, calculated a correct trajectory, and in March 1974, entered Mars orbit and released its entry probe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>. However, the Lander failed to land safely, with transmission cutting off as it approached the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. The cause is unclear, but the probe was falling faster than expected, potentially due to a failed final landing rocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.

## Overall Challenges and Legacy

The [[soviet_mars_missions_from_1960_to_1973 | Soviet Mars program]] was largely defined by its intense [[comparison_of_soviet_and_american_space_programs | competition with the United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. While this political importance granted substantial resources, it also imposed arduous political requirements, rushed timelines, and led to poor execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>. Specific and recurring challenges included:
*   **Rocket Failures:** Persistent issues with the Molnia rocket's fourth stage and manufacturing defects in lower stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Proton rocket failures also plagued M69 missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Defects:** Problems extended to probes themselves, requiring repairs and rework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Most notably, the use of aluminum instead of gold leads in transistors caused widespread failures in the 1973 missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. This highlights [[challenges_in_soviet_computer_production | challenges in Soviet computer production]] and component quality.
*   **Lack of Data & Uncontrolled Entry:** Without reliable atmospheric data from successful orbiters, Landers had to attempt "uncontrolled ballistic entry," which was inherently riskier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.
*   **Computer and Software Errors:** Misinterpreted data by onboard computer programs led to failed landings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>, and later, faulty commands and computer logic errors plagued the Phobos missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.
*   **Integration Issues:** Early probes faced issues integrating scientific instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Political Pressure and Rushed Timelines:** The drive to meet deadlines, particularly due to the [[comparison_of_soviet_and_american_space_programs | Space Race]], often led to shortcuts and compromises in development and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.

After the 1973 missions, perceived as a failure, the [[soviet_space_exploration_achievements_and_failures | Soviet space program]] pivoted away from Mars, focusing instead on [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venus]], where they had a clear advantage and achieved significant [[venera_mission_successes_and_impacts | Venera mission successes and impacts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a>. A final attempt to explore Phobos, a Martian moon, occurred in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>. Phobos 1 failed due to a faulty command and computer logic error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>, while Phobos 2 sent pictures but failed to release its Lander due to a malfunctioning computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

Despite their relative lack of success compared to American efforts, the [[soviet_mars_missions_from_1960_to_1973 | Soviet Mars program]] represented an incredible effort to send 15 robots millions of kilometers across space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:28">[00:42:28]</a>. Their endeavors, though often foiled, laid foundational knowledge for interplanetary travel.

[[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group | HNA Group's]] rapid expansion and global acquisitions were significantly influenced by various forms of government involvement, ranging from direct financial support and policy changes to implied backing and regulatory environments.

## Early Policy and Regulatory Environment
*   **Establishment of Hainan Special Economic Zone**
    *   In 1988, the central Chinese government designated the island of Hainan as its own province and a special economic zone to attract more investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>.
    *   The new Hainan provincial government faced the formidable task of developing the historical "backwater" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>.
*   **Airline Industry Deregulation**
    *   The same year, the central Chinese government began deregulating its airline industry, restructuring its national airline monopoly into six individual airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:03">[01:49:03]</a>.
    *   A key measure was allowing private-public partnerships for provincial governments to establish regional airline carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:23">[02:00:23]</a>.
*   **Initial Government Capital**
    *   The Hainan government contributed 10 million RMB (approximately $1.4 million) as startup capital to establish Hainan Provincial Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:15">[02:12:15]</a>.
*   **Allowing Joint-Stock Companies**
    *   When the initial capital proved insufficient, HNA's founders convinced the local government to reboot the business as a joint-stock company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:08">[03:43:08]</a>. This new development in China allowed private individuals to take shares in what was essentially a state-owned enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:49">[03:47:49]</a>.
*   **Lax Banking Regulations**
    *   In HNA's early days, Chinese banks lacked sophisticated knowledge of how mortgages should work, allowing HNA to re-mortgage purchased planes multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:39">[04:54:39]</a>. This allowed HNA to double-dip their leverage and grow very fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **Consolidation of Airlines**
    *   By the late 1990s, China's airline sector was fragmented with over 30 carriers losing money, leading to a government-mandated consolidation in 2000 that created an oligopoly of three state-owned airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:19">[08:54:19]</a>. This environment pushed smaller airlines like Hainan Airlines to seek "arranged marriages" with other carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:20">[09:22:20]</a>.

## Direct Financial Support and Bailouts
*   **SARS Epidemic Bailout (2003)**
    *   During the 2003 SARS epidemic, HNA suffered a massive loss of 1.5 billion RMB and came close to bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:19">[10:20:19]</a>.
    *   Despite having a relatively small financial stake, the Hainan provincial government bailed out HNA, injecting 1.5 billion RMB in 2005, which amounted to 10% of its entire revenue that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:37">[10:37:37]</a>.
*   **Global Financial Crisis Bailout (2008)**
    *   The 2008 global financial crisis led HNA Group to another significant loss of 1.73 billion RMB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:32">[11:51:32]</a>.
    *   The Hainan provincial government injected another 1.5 billion RMB into the company, helping it survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:09">[12:17:09]</a>.
    *   Additionally, the Chinese government's 4 trillion RMB stimulus package in November 2008 led to new infrastructure projects, causing land prices to skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:21">[12:25:21]</a>. This greatly increased the value of land HNA held, such as the 9,000 acres in Haikou acquired when it bought Haikou Airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:13">[12:36:13]</a>.

## Indirect Support and Perceived Influence
*   **Connections to Officials**
    *   Co-founder Chen Feng's background included serving in the People's Liberation Army Air Force and working in China's civil aviation regulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:10">[02:26:10]</a>.
    *   Rumors exist of a deeper connection with Wang Qishan, a powerful anti-corruption czar and Xi Jinping ally, who served as the Agricultural Investment Trust of China's chief executive while Chen Feng was there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:12">[03:04:12]</a>.
*   **Partnering on Government Projects**
    *   HNA partnered with provincial and city governments on infrastructure projects, leasing assets to them to help governments duck their debt limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:20">[22:28:20]</a>. This allowed HNA to acquire land development projects and other hard assets, which they then mortgaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:00]</a>.
*   **Investor Perception**
    *   A 2012 investor presentation reportedly reassured potential investors by stating that despite appearing opaque, "investors should take comfort from close government relationships at many levels both above and within the HNA umbrella" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:54:02">[29:54:02]</a>.
    *   The notion persisted that HNA's extensive borrowing and acquisitions were possible because it had the backing of, or was even a vehicle for, the Chinese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:37">[30:15:37]</a>. This caused anxiety in the West about the company's true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:26:08">[30:26:08]</a>.

## Government Scrutiny and Decline
*   **Regulatory Crackdown (2017)**
    *   In June 2017, the China Banking Regulatory Commission ordered several banks to conduct risk checks on the overseas borrowing and investing of HNA and other conglomerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:15">[24:22:15]</a>.
    *   In November 2017, the Chinese central government criticized one of HNA's core real estate projects, the Sanya new airport reclamation project, for "suspected illegal use of the sea," which shook confidence in the company's vaunted government connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:33:07">[25:33:07]</a>.
*   **Bankruptcy and Restructuring**
    *   The final [[bankruptcy_and_restructuring_of_hna_group | crisis]] that HNA could not overcome was sparked by the devastating effects of COVID-19 on its core airline and travel businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:05">[29:06:05]</a>.
    *   In February 2021, HNA finally entered bankruptcy proceedings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:14:02">[29:14:02]</a>. The company will likely be split into four businesses after all bankruptcy procedures are done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[29:27:00]</a>.
    *   In September 2021, Chen Feng and his chief executive Adam Tan were detained by the Chinese government for suspected crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:34:02">[29:34:02]</a>.

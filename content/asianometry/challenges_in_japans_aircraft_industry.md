Japan's ambition to re-establish itself as a major player in the commercial aircraft industry faced significant hurdles, exemplified by the struggles of the Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), later rebranded as the SpaceJet.

## The Mitsubishi SpaceJet Program: A Case Study in Challenges

The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) program, intended to be Japan's first indigenous commercial aircraft in nearly half a century, was officially frozen in 2020 after more than ten years of development, six delays, and nearly nine billion dollars spent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Mitsubishi Aircraft, the subsidiary responsible for the plane, is now insolvent and operates with a skeleton crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Historical Context

Japan had a thriving aircraft industry before World War II, with companies like Mitsubishi, Hitachi, Fuji, and Kawasaki entering the space at the government's behest, primarily for military projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. However, industrial development was halted after Japan lost the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This created a critical delay, causing Japan to fall behind in the generational technology shift from propeller planes to jets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Furthermore, because the industry previously serviced the government, these companies lacked commercial competitiveness and experience in selling to airliners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### The NAMC YS-11 Project

Japan's only post-war attempt at building a commercial plane was the NAMC YS-11, a turboprop airliner that first flew in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) encouraged a consortium of companies to design and build it to replace Douglas DC-3s on domestic routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

The YS-11 was produced for a decade, selling about 161 units before shutting down in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The project ultimately failed, incurring a $600 million loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. However, this experience allowed Japan to enter Boeing's supplier network, and the country would become a dominant supplier in the commercial aircraft industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Re-entering the Commercial Market: The MRJ

By the early 2000s, the commercial air travel space was dominated by large jets and turboprops, with regional jets (seating up to 100 passengers and flying farther than turboprops) emerging as a middle ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This market was dominated by Bombardier (Canada) and Embraer (Brazil), but new competition was emerging from Russia's Sukhoi Superjet 100 and China's Comac ARJ21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

Japanese industry watchers saw an opportunity to establish a flagship technology in this growing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

#### Project Launch and Initial Goals

In 2003, the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) launched a five-year, $400 million program to study an indigenous regional jet for 30 to 90 passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The seating capacity was later upscaled to 70-90 seats based on market demand projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) was selected to lead the project, exhibiting a concept in 2007 and officially launching the program in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. MHI founded the Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation subsidiary, with investment from Toyota and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

MHI, Japan's biggest military supplier with experience producing fighter jets and a critical supplier to Boeing (contributing 35% of a Boeing 787, including main wings), felt confident in its ability to build its own plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

The MRJ was designed as a high-tech, stylish, and comfortable passenger jet, focusing on fuel efficiency, claiming a 20-30% fuel reduction over competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The Japanese government provided hundreds of millions in subsidies for distinguishing technologies like carbon composite molding and advanced aerodynamic design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Program Milestones and Delays

The MRJ needed to achieve three milestones: finalize design, build the supply chain and manufacture for first flight, and pass flight tests for certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The original 2008 plan targeted a 2013 launch date and a $1.3 billion development cost, requiring 300-400 unit sales for payback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

#### Delay 1: Design Changes (September 2009)

The initial design featured wings with a drastic sweep angle, intended to use a significant percentage of carbon-based composite materials, likely tapping into Toray, Boeing's supplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. However, the design changed in September 2009, with main wings becoming aluminum and composites reduced from 30% to 10-15% of the plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

Possible reasons for this change included supply chain limitations (Toray's ability to deliver complex composites) or design concerns, as composite materials are weak against high-impact forces experienced during frequent regional jet takeoffs and landings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This resulted in a six-month delay, pushing first flight to Q2 2012 and deliveries to early 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

#### Challenges with Supply Chain and Costs (2011-2013)

Despite a long-standing alliance and technology transfer agreement between Mitsubishi and Boeing, Mitsubishi struggled to build its supply network for the MRJ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. An aircraft has about a million precise parts, often made by a small group of suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Without the economies of scale enjoyed by giants like Boeing and Airbus, Mitsubishi sometimes paid twice as much for parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

*   **Delay 2 (April 2012):** Due to supply chain issues, the first flight was pushed back to Q3 2013 and deliveries to mid-2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
*   **Delay 3 (August 2013):** Further supply partner issues led to deliveries being pushed back two more years to mid-2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

By this point, the MRJ's break-even sales point increased from 300-400 units to 750, with a new sales target of 1,000-1,500 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

#### Rollout and First Flight (October 2014 - November 2015)

Mitsubishi held its rollout ceremony in October 2014, signaling the completion of the first plane's assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The first flight took place a year later in November 2015 at Nagoya Airport, appearing to go well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

#### Certification Challenges and Further Delays

*   **Delay 4 (2015):** After reviewing the overall schedule for internal flight tests and type certification (2,500+ hours, mostly in the US, across 400 line items), deliveries were pushed back another year to Q3 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Critically, this coincided with Embraer's E2 series, which used the same Pratt & Whitney engine, eliminating the MRJ's 20% fuel consumption advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. By 2016, the program budget had ballooned to nearly $3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

*   **Delay 5 (2017):** Type certification tests were challenging, with misinterpretations and a lack of proper documentation. Engineers adopting their own approaches, particularly for electric wiring, led to issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Due to tightened FAA aircraft wiring certifications after the TWA Flight 800 crash, Mitsubishi couldn't explain its wiring design without proper documentation. Rather than rework 23,000 wires individually, the company decided to redo the entire wiring system, which was tantamount to a total internal redesign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. This pushed delivery dates to mid-2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Four of the five delays were attributed to a "sloppy lack of documentation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

In response, Mitsubishi changed its organizational structure, hired more foreign engineers with aircraft experience, and gave them decision-making power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

#### Rebranding and Final Delays

In June 2019, the MRJ was rebranded as the Mitsubishi SpaceJet, with the MRJ90 becoming the SpaceJet M90 and the MRJ70 reworked into the SpaceJet M100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This change was in response to concerns from major American regional airline customers like SkyWest, whose contracts were subject to "scope clauses" from unionized major airline pilots, which restrict regional jet seat numbers and maximum takeoff weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

*   **Delay 6 (January 2020):** The new design for the SpaceJet M100 meant it could not acquire the necessary certification before mid-2020, pushing deliveries to 2021 or beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

### Program Suspension

Compounding the issues, a global event (the pandemic) began affecting air travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. In March 2020, a type certification flight for an MJ-90 was delayed due to pandemic lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

In May 2020, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries reported its first quarterly loss in 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. The company halved its SpaceJet development plan, postponed production, reduced personnel, and closed US development centers, bringing work back to Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

Finally, in October 2020, Mitsubishi announced a three-year medium-term management plan, pausing all SpaceJet M90 development and laying off 95% of Mitsubishi Aircraft employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. The company would only maintain certification documentation, awaiting an anticipated air travel recovery in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

### Conclusion

Japan's odyssey with the SpaceJet reflects the inherent difficulty of building cutting-edge commercial aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. While the program had made progress from 2003 to 2020, its functional death due to liquidation and a three-year pause means a massive loss of experience, talent, and resources, making revival a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

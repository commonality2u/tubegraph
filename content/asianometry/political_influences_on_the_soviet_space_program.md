The [[soviet_space_exploration_achievements_and_failures | Soviet space program]], particularly its endeavors to explore Mars, was heavily influenced by political directives and the intense [[comparison_of_soviet_and_american_space_programs | Space Race]] with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. From 1960 to 1973, the Soviet Union launched 15 probes and orbiters to Mars, consistently struggling to match NASA's successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

### Early Political Directives and the Space Race

The foundation of the Soviet rocket program was laid in 1950 when Joseph Stalin sought a missile capable of striking Western enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. He tasked Sergey Korolev with this mission, who initially worked with gliders but later moved into rockets, enabling him to reverse engineer German V2 rocket designs in the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

After Stalin's death, the political climate loosened, allowing Korolev to pursue his dream of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. In January 1956, after significant lobbying, the Politburo approved the development of "Object D," later known as Sputnik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Its successful launch on October 4, 1957, generated unexpected international excitement, particularly in the West, where it spurred American political elites to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

Capitalizing on Sputnik's success, Korolev and his team proposed an expedition to the Moon in January 1958, followed by a broader program in July 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This ambitious plan envisioned sending robot spacecraft to Mars and Venus, upgrading the R7 rocket to a three-stage version, and eventually a four-stage version to send humans to these planets and establish colonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. While the program initially focused on lunar probes, Mars was considered the "real prize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

### Khrushchev's Pressure and Competition

The political dimension intensified as the [[comparison_of_soviet_and_american_space_programs | Space Race]] progressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. In January 1960, Nikita Khrushchev expressed concern about the growing American space program and demanded launches to Mars and Venus within the 1960 orbital window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. This led to a rushed development of the Mars Project 1M and the new Molniya rocket, which proved disastrous, resulting in early failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. Reportedly, Khrushchev had even brought models of the Mars craft to the United Nations as a "bragging gift" for President Eisenhower, which were never given due to the failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

### The Cuban Missile Crisis Impact

The political stakes became evident during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. The Baikonur Spaceport, having only two launch pads, required military ICBMs and civilian rockets to share facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. During the crisis, Korolev's deputy, Boris Chertok, was ordered to remove a Mars spacecraft from the pad to make way for an ICBM, highlighting the military-first priority and the geopolitical tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. Despite the intense situation, the Mars probe was eventually launched, but it still failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.

### Shift to the Moon Race and Managerial Chaos

The success of the American Mariner 4 mission to Mars in July 1965, which returned the first close-up photographs, was a "stinging failure" for the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>. This, combined with the realization that the Americans were serious about a crewed Moon landing, prompted a significant political shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. In August 1964, the Politburo instructed Korolev and his teams to directly compete with the U.S. in a Moon race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. This decision "threw the Soviet space program's plans out the window," leading to managerial chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.

With the Moon as his primary objective, Korolev reassigned robotic planetary missions to a new firm, Lavochkin, in March 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.

### Political Pressure and the M69 Program

Despite the change in leadership, political pressure remained immense. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union demanded that the 1969 Mars launch date for the M69 project be met, issuing a special military-industrial resolution to enforce it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:00">[19:22:00]</a>. The Central Committee required weekly updates, and underperforming suppliers and individuals were blacklisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:38:00">[19:38:00]</a>. Teams worked around the clock, with specialists often called in during the night, and amenities like 24-hour cafeterias were provided, though no overtime pay was given, as work was expected to be out of "enthusiasm for the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>.

Tragically, both M69 probes launched in 1969 failed due to rocket issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>. This "mass of political pressure" was seen as having "come back to haunt them," leading to "yet another failure" in the [[soviet_mars_missions_from_1960_to_1973 | Soviet Mars missions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:38:00">[21:38:00]</a>. The defeat was compounded by the American Apollo 11 Moon landing in July 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>.

### The 1971 and 1973 Mars Missions

For the 1971 Mars launch window, the Soviets again aimed for a propaganda victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:31:00">[28:31:00]</a>. They designed the M71s Orbiter to reach Mars first, ahead of the American Mariner 8 and 9 missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:42:00">[28:42:00]</a>. While Mariner 8 failed, the M71s mission also failed due to a gross coding error, where the fourth stage was programmed to fire after 150 hours instead of 1.5 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>. Mariner 9 subsequently became the first orbiter around Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>.

Despite a policy of d√©tente and data sharing agreements between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the early 1970s, which included exchanging data from [[soviet_mars_missions_from_1960_to_1973 | Mars 2]], Mars 3, and Venera 8 missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:52:00">[33:52:00]</a>, the competitive "race was still on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:33:00">[34:33:00]</a>. Fearing the comprehensive American Viking missions in 1975, the Soviet leadership planned an "all-out assault on Mars" for the 1973 launch window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:50:00">[34:50:00]</a>.

This led to the launch of four spacecraft (Mars 4, 5, 6, 7) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:00">[35:00:00]</a>. However, a critical flaw lurked within: faulty 2T312 transistors, fabricated with aluminum leads instead of the specified gold, due to material shortages or cost reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00:00">[36:00:00]</a>. Engineers estimated a 50/50 chance of catastrophic failure, but the ministry decided to proceed rather than face a "political shame show" by delaying the mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:00:00">[37:00:00]</a>. This decision proved costly, as the faulty transistors likely contributed to the failures of Mars 4 and 7, though Mars 5 had partial success and Mars 6 had an "impressive story" despite its ultimate failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:29:00">[37:29:00]</a>.

### Conclusion

The 1973 missions were largely considered a failure by leadership, resulting in the dismissal of chief designer Vasili Mishin and the elevation of Valentin Glushko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:27:00">[40:27:00]</a>. Glushko pivoted the program towards the Buran space shuttle and Energia launcher, leading to fewer resources for planetary exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:38:00">[40:38:00]</a>. Despite fervent belief among "Soviet Mars people" in ambitious future missions, leadership pragmatically decided to concentrate on Venus, where they had a clear advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01:00">[41:01:00]</a>.

The [[soviet_mars_missions_from_1960_to_1973 | Soviet Mars program]] was largely defined by its [[comparison_of_soviet_and_american_space_programs | competition]] with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:01:00">[42:01:00]</a>. While this political importance granted substantial resources, "arduous political requirements," limited launch windows, poor execution, and bad luck ultimately foiled Soviet success on Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:05:00">[42:05:00]</a>.

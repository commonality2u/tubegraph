Concerns have arisen in Taiwan regarding the expansion of TSMC's production facilities outside the country, particularly with the [[tsmcs_arizona_facility | TSMC Arizona facility]] starting operations in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This has led to speculation among some in Taiwan that America is attempting to "steal" TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## TSMC's Expansion Abroad

### [[tsmcs_arizona_facility | TSMC's Arizona Facility]]
TSMC announced its Arizona production facility in May 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The initial plan was to produce N5 chips, which were considered very advanced as the most advanced node TSMC had attempted to bring outside Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Originally, Taiwanese citizens took comfort in the relatively small size of the Arizona site, projected to produce about 20,000 300-millimeter wafers a month, compared to Taiwan's four gigafabs producing over 100,000 wafers a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. They also noted that N5 would not be the leading edge by the time the factory came online in 2024, expecting N3 to be operational by then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

However, new announcements in December 2022 altered this perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>:
*   TSMC will bring their N4 process to Arizona, an upgrade to the N5 line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   A second Arizona factory will be opened, with an additional investment of $28 billion over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This second fab will be equipped with N3 technology, expected to reach high-volume production by 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Despite these expansions, the Financial Times reports that TSMC remains committed to keeping its most advanced nodes in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Other International Plans
TSMC is also building a specialty N28 plant in Japan's Kumamoto prefecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Discussions for a plant in Germany have also been ongoing for a long time, though no official announcement has been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Strategic Drivers for Expansion
These new developments represent a departure from TSMC's long-standing norm, articulated by leaders like [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | Morris Chang]], that its operational success comes from doing everything, especially its most advanced work, in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This shift is driven by a confluence of demand and financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

*   **Customer Demand:** As a commercial entity, TSMC works closely with its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Apple, which accounts for about 25% of TSMC's total revenue, is a singular customer that bankrolls the most advanced chip rollouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated that they will be buying from the Arizona plant starting in 2024 and expect to source from Europe as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. TSMC's ascent is linked to Apple's decision to switch from [[impact_on_tsmc_and_samsung | Samsung]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Government Subsidies:** The Chips Act of 2022 allocated $50 billion in subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Competitors like [[impact_on_tsmc_and_samsung | Samsung]] (with a $17 billion plant in Taylor, Texas) and Intel (with a $20 billion chip plan in Columbus, Ohio) are building massive facilities in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Strategically, TSMC can take these subsidies to reduce funding available to its competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

## Addressing "Stealing" Claims and [[impact_of_tsmcs_expansion_on_taiwan | Impact on Taiwan]]

The notion that America is "stealing" TSMC's manufacturing from Taiwan, causing a "massive loss to the Taiwanese economy," is considered an overstatement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. To assess this, it's important to review the scale of investments.

### Capital Expenditure
TSMC's capital expenditure for 2022 was about $36 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The second Arizona fab investment adds about $28 billion over three years until 2026, which is approximately $9 billion a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This represents 25% to 30% of the proposed annual $36 billion capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Therefore, the majority of the company's spending will still be in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Wafer Shipments
In 2021, TSMC produced and shipped 14.2 million 300-millimeter equivalent wafers, projected to increase to 15-16 million wafers in 2022, or about 1.3 million wafers a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. A significant number, estimated at 75% to 85%, are produced in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

When the Arizona fab begins production in 2024, it will produce around 20,000 300-millimeter equivalent wafers a month, which is less than 1/50th of current annual production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Even with planned expansion to 50,000 wafers a month by 2026, it would still not be enough to shift the majority of production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## Taiwan's Enduring Importance
TSMC continues to prioritize and significantly invest in Taiwan. The company is juggling at least five other major build-outs in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>:
*   New phases to existing Taiwanese fabs, including expansions in Tainan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   New [[tsmcs_n2_process_node_and_new_fab_locations | N2 plants]] in Hsinchu's Baoshan and potentially Taichung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   Future plans for an N1 plant in the Longtan District of southern Taoyuan City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   A Kaohsiung fab for N28 production, with construction beginning in November 2022 (though N7 plans were rolled back due to market weakness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

Taiwan remains TSMC's greatest asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. The problematic assumption that overseas fabs make America self-sufficient in silicon overlooks critical aspects of the semiconductor ecosystem:

*   **Diverse Chip Needs:** The majority of the world's industrially important semiconductors (for fridges, airplanes, cars) are not leading-edge N4 and N3 chips. Instead, they are typically 130-nanometer, 65-nanometer, and N28 chips, which are high in volume but low in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Other Taiwanese Foundries:** Taiwan hosts other significant semiconductor foundries like UMC (number three largest), Powerchip (seventh), and Vanguard (eighth), which possess specialty processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Supply Chain Dominance:** Taiwan leads in other parts of the chip supply chain, including wafers, packaging, assembly, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. America's position in global packaging, assembly, and test capacity is low (3% compared to 10% in fabrication market share) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Taiwan has three of the world's five largest outsourced semiconductor packaging, assembly, and testing (OSAT) companies, including the largest, ASE Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. There is no U.S. government funding for conventional packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Human Capital:** The core managers running the fabs, including thousands of difficult-to-replace individuals in R&D, operations, and supply chain management, are in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Billions of dollars and 50 years of industrial development have made Taiwan a leader not only in semiconductor manufacturing but also in electronics assembly and specialty plastics, which cannot be replaced quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

In conclusion, TSMC's global expansion, while significant, does not diminish Taiwan's central role in the company's operations or the broader semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

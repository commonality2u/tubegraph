The operating system Unix emerged as a pivotal moment in technology history, providing a platform for software development capable of handling diverse hardware without being excessively expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This innovation aimed to overcome the wasteful practice of rewriting all code when computer hardware was upgraded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## The Genesis: From Multics' Ashes

The story of Unix's creation began with the [[the_multics_project_and_its_impact_on_unix | Multics project]], initiated in 1965 by scientists from Bell Labs, MIT, and General Electric (GE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Named "Multiplexed Information and Computing Service," Multics aimed to be a general-purpose utility for time-sharing on computer systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Given the high cost of computers, time-sharing operating systems allowed multiple users to efficiently share resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. These systems evolved into communication tools, connecting users with public profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. GE provided the Multics team with a GE 645 mainframe, simulated by a GE 635 computer, for their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Multics experimented with pioneering concepts, including arbitrary file names, directory structures, and a virtual memory system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Virtual memory allowed secondary storage, like hard drives, to function as if it were part of the main RAM, enabling computers to handle more data than their physical memory allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This was a significant improvement over existing file systems and is still in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The Multics team sought to integrate these ideas into a single commercial product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### The End of Multics
The Multics project ultimately became bogged down by its ambitious scope, leading to excessive spending and vague plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Frustrated by the lack of a workable product, Bell Labs formally withdrew from the project in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. GE also exited the computer industry, selling its division to Honeywell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## The Birth of Unix

Despite the official withdrawal, a few scientists at the Bell Labs Computing Science Research Center—Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Rudd Canaday, Doug McIlroy, and J.F. Ossanna—continued their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The cessation of Multics meant they lost access to the GE 635 computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Ken Thompson, who had developed a space game called "Space Travel" for the GE computer, sought a new platform to continue playing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. "Space Travel" simulated planetary movement and allowed players to guide a ship and land on planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The game was expensive to play on the timeshare system, costing $50-75 per session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. In 1969, Thompson found an unused graphics-capable PDP-7 minicomputer and decided to rewrite the game for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This involved reimplementing a debugging subsystem and a floating-point arithmetic package, a tedious process that involved carrying paper tapes from the GE computer to the PDP-7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### A File System
After successfully porting "Space Travel," Thompson, along with Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday, implemented a new type of file system they had been discussing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Thompson, already familiar with the PDP-7, hacked out an implementation in a day or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. They then added simple utilities for copying, printing, deleting, and editing files, as well as a basic command interpreter or "shell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

The concept of a "file" evolved into an interface for data operations like reading or writing, with the file system remaining indifferent to the file's content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This abstraction removed hardware differences, allowing anyone on any device to modify a file, which became one of Unix's key advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

By the end of summer 1969, the entire system had been rewritten, separate from the original GECOS operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. It was initially seen as a convenient platform for software development rather than a full operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Around 1970, team member Brian Kernighan suggested the name "Unics," a "treacherous pun" on Multics, which later became "Unix" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Early Utility and Naming
Unix on the PDP-7 provided a decent programming environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. In 1970, the team requested a new DEC PDP-11, which was cheaper at $65,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The request was approved because it included a compelling use case: applying the file system for creating and editing text files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

[[unixs_internal_development_and_initial_use_at_bell_labs | Unix]] was rewritten for the PDP-11's assembly language, incorporating a text editor and "roff," a typesetting markup language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. This version was offered to the Bell Labs Patent Department, which chose Unix over commercial products because Thompson and Ritchie quickly added line-numbered pages to "roff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. What started with three typists became a popular internal product across Bell Labs, with multiple versions and its own support group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## From Internal Tool to Widespread Adoption

Though initially intended as an internal tool for Bell Labs, [[the_spread_of_unix_to_universities_and_its_adoption_into_industry | Unix]] rapidly spread throughout the computing community due to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

1.  **Humble Hardware**: Unix was developed on relatively modest hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. A standard Unix computer, typically a PDP-11/40, cost between $50,000 and $150,000 in 1977, significantly cheaper than mainframes that could cost half a million dollars or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
2.  **Written in C**: Unix was the first operating system written in an attractive, higher-level programming language called "C" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Dennis Ritchie developed C from "B," which Ken Thompson had created by porting Martin Richards' Basic Combined Programming Language (BCPL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Programming in C was far easier than in low-level machine assembly language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This made Unix easy to port to different hardware architectures and simpler to modify and enhance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
3.  **Low Acquisition Cost**: AT&T and Bell Labs sold the Unix source code to nonprofits like universities for only a few hundred dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This contrasted sharply with other software companies that guarded their source code and prohibited modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### The AT&T Consent Decree's Role
This liberal distribution policy was not purely altruistic. In 1956, AT&T settled an antitrust lawsuit with the US government, known as the 1956 AT&T Consent Decree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This settlement granted AT&T a legal monopoly on the US telephone system in exchange for making all its inventions available to academia for free or licensing them on fair and reasonable terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The decree also barred AT&T from entering the computer business, rendering Unix commercially useless to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

The Consent Decree had previously facilitated the spread of the transistor and now did the same for Unix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Bell Labs managers, wary of violating the decree, shied away from providing support to licensees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This unintendedly fostered a collaborative environment where university students, with more ingenuity and time than money, worked together to implement desired features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. By the early 1970s, Unix had spread globally, running on university computers in Australia, the UK, Belgium, and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Berkeley Unix (BSD)

In November 1973, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie presented the first Unix paper at a symposium at Purdue University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. UC Berkeley Professor Bob Fabry obtained a copy, and Berkeley departments pooled resources to acquire a PDP minicomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Ken Thompson himself joined Berkeley as a visiting professor in 1975 to help install Unix Version 6 on a new PDP 11/70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

Two students, Chuck Haley and Bill Joy, became deeply involved with Unix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. They completed a Pascal implementation that Thompson had started, enabling Unix to support this higher-level language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Their Pascal implementation was widely admired for its excellent error handling, contrasting with Thompson's less user-friendly error messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Haley and Joy also added utilities, including "ex" (EXtended), a capable WYSIWYG text editor, which later evolved into "vim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

The quality of Berkeley's Pascal compiler and its speed led to numerous requests for copies of their Unix variant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. In early 1977, Bill Joy compiled 30 copies of what he named the "Berkeley Software Distribution" (BSD), selling them for about $50 per tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This became very popular, generating good money for Joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. A second version, 2BSD, quickly followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

In 1978, DEC introduced the VAX-11/780, a 32-bit computer with increased memory and processing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. AT&T's UNIX/32V version for the VAX did not support its virtual memory capabilities, limiting processing to physical memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. In a significant development, Bill Joy and Ozalp Babaoglu added virtual memory support, shipping it in December 1979 as 3BSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This established Berkeley as a leading coordinator for new Unix releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

### DARPA and the Internet
BSD took another major step forward thanks to DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. By 1979, DARPA sought to consolidate its disparate software systems, written in various languages for different computers, into a single "universal computing environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. They chose Unix due to its ability to handle different hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

In 1980, Bob Fabry received an 18-month contract from DARPA to add features to 3BSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. He and Bill Joy established the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG), a small steering committee coordinating a global network of volunteer contributors on the 4BSD series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This new Unix version had to support DARPA's protocols, including those for the Internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Notably, 4.2BSD fully supported the Internet protocol stack TCP/IP, significantly popularizing the Internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. 4.2BSD was extremely popular, with over a thousand licenses issued within a month of its April 1983 release, exceeding all previous distributions combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## Commercialization and Industry Impact

In the summer of 1982, Bill Joy left the CSRG to co-found [[the_founding_and_early_growth_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Although his work at BSD was financially rewarding, Joy felt the academic environment at Berkeley constrained growth, stating it "needed to be a commercial activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

[[history_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] became renowned for pioneering and popularizing the workstation computer, which integrated the Unix OS with scientific/engineering applications, the Motorola 68000 microprocessor, and other off-the-shelf hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Sun later developed its own closed-source Unix variant, SunOS, branched from 4.2BSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. While a single Sun workstation couldn't match a mainframe, these machines were designed to be networked, making them immensely valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Sun became one of the fastest-growing companies in Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

[[the_commercial_evolution_and_significance_of_unix_in_the_technology_industry | Sun was not the only company to commercialize Unix]]. Other notable startups included:
*   **Mt. Xinu**: A Berkeley-based software company that sold a commercially licensed version of BSD for the DEC Vax minicomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
*   **Santa Cruz Operation**: Sold Unix variants for x86 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Onyx Systems**: Marketed a Unix variant for Zilog-based Personal Computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   **Microsoft**: Developed its own Unix variant for 16-bit microcomputers called Xenix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
*   **NeXT**: Steve Jobs' workstation computer startup, founded in 1985, whose operating system NeXTSTEP was derived from 4.3BSD Tahoe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Conclusion

Unix pioneered powerful concepts that helped establish software as the powerhouse industry it is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Its early development was driven by individuals interested in the technology, not primarily by profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. However, as the Unix community grew and its potential became evident, the work surrounding it transitioned into a commercial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. By 1983, Unix had moved beyond its awkward growth years, setting the stage for significant commercial opportunities and the impending "Unix Wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

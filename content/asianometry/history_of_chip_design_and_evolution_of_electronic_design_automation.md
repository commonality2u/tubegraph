In the past, chip design involved intricate diagrams and drawings painstakingly created by hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, modern chip design no longer relies on manual drawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Today, a critical software tool known as [[role_and_significance_of_electronic_design_automation_in_chip_manufacturing | Electronic Design Automation (EDA)]] is indispensable for chip designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Without EDA software, many of today's most advanced chips could not be manufactured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Chip Design Process Flow
To understand how EDA software aids chip designers, it's essential to know the [[process_of_chip_design_flow_from_requirements_to_physical_design | chip design process flow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Although the process and names may vary between companies like Apple or Nvidia, a generic flow typically includes several stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>:

1.  **Requirements Definition**: Product designers and system engineers envision a product, establishing a set of integrated circuit requirements based on customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
2.  **Logic Design (Circuit Design)**: The chip's requirements then enter logic design, where abstract requirements are translated into circuits with the necessary logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This involves:
    *   **Logic Circuits (Gates)**: These act as decision boxes, receiving inputs and producing an output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   **Memory Circuits**: These circuits are capable of remembering whether a value was true or false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   The outcome of this stage is a "net list," which is a grouping of logic and memory circuits connected by wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
3.  **Physical Design**: The design is handed over to physical designers who manage the literal physical layout of the logic circuits, memory circuits, and their interconnections on the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This task becomes very difficult with thousands or millions of circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
4.  **Verification and Testing**: After physical design, the chip design is verified and tested for errors before being sent to a foundry like TSMC or Samsung Foundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. EDA software is heavily involved in every one of these stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, including design rule checking at the foundry level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, where errors can cost millions of dollars if they slip into fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Early History and The Need for Automation
In the early stages of chip design, up until the 1970s, designs were drawn by hand on paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. These paper designs were then transferred to a photo mask, often made of ruby lith, which was used to project the design's patterns onto the substrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

As chips grew in complexity, with increasing numbers of transistors and connections, simple in-house software tools were developed by large companies to assist in the design process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. These tools evolved into the EDA software used today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

The first software programs automated the placement of a small number of blocks and wires on circuit boards, not chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Routing was an early focus due to its tedious and repetitive nature as board components moved around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Initially, these mainframe programs used simple breadth-first search algorithms across a grid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, but quickly moved to more efficient algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. As the number of components in integrated circuits surpassed those on circuit boards, EDA software transitioned to the silicon realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Bringing EDA to silicon addressed daunting challenges in chip making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>, especially as chips became multi-layered, requiring 3D wiring and consideration for layer-to-layer connections called vias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This complexity created significant opportunities for errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Overcoming the Productivity Gap
[[Advancements in semiconductor technology | Moore's Law]], an observation about the doubling of transistors on a chip every two years, set the pace for the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. While fabrication facilities became capable of fabbing an increasing number of transistors (historically a 58% annual rise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, designing those transistors is another matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Chip design cannot scale as fast as manufacturing capabilities because human knowledge and skills do not scale as rapidly as tools and capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This creates a "productivity gap" between design and manufacturing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. For example, a company like AMD might need years to design a 5-nanometer chip, even if TSMC had the capacity ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Better EDA tools are the only practical way for chip design teams to keep up and close this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## [[Technological advancements that impacted FPGA development | Technological Advancements]] and Design Styles
Commercial automatic physical design systems began to emerge in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. These advancements were not only due to improved computing power but also powerful new display technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Early EDA software literally drew things on paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, but the advent of reasonably priced storage tube class CRT screens made the industry more accessible to designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

The industry also adopted new approaches to chip design that unlocked more of EDA's automation powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>:
*   **Programmable Logic Arrays (PLAs)**: While advocated by engineers for being space-efficient on paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, EDA software for this style did not scale well, requiring extensive redrawing when components changed and forcing designers to handle design at both high and low levels of abstraction simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Standard Cell Style**: The semiconductor industry developed this style, where designers choose from a library of standardized groups of gates called "cells" and decide how they are wired together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This approach allowed the design process to split into separate logical and layout functions, abstracting away lower-level details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Since cells are standardized, EDA software can consistently create electrically and physically correct designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Although some criticized it for being less area-efficient, its superior workflow with EDA made it the industry standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## [[Major companies and players in the electronic design automation industry | Key Players in the EDA Industry]]
An EDA industry emerged to service various parts of the chip design process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Over time, these software firms consolidated as tasks became harder and required integration across different design cycle stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Their proprietary libraries often became the de facto industry standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

The two leading companies in this space are Cadence and Synopsys, both based in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. These companies are the result of numerous acquisitions and have long-standing alliances with major players like TSMC and Samsung Foundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, simplifying the transition from design to the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Fabless entrants looking to enter the semiconductor world typically need to acquire bundles of their software tools, which can cost millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

Beyond EDA tools, these companies also own significant IP, licensing out useful IP blocks for standard chip functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This business model, combining software subscriptions and IP licensing, provides them with high gross margins and strong cash flows, allowing substantial R&D investment to further extend their advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

While their positions are currently strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, a few companies are challenging these incumbents. Google reportedly developed its own EDA tool for a YouTube chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, and Chinese alternatives like Empyrean and Celixoff have gained attention amidst the U.S.-China trade war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Additionally, open-source EDA tools exist for initiatives like RISC-V <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, though these efforts currently lag behind market leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## [[Emerging trends and future developments in electronic design automation | Future Developments in EDA]]
Exciting new developments are on the horizon for EDA-enabled chip design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Programmers are applying machine learning to EDA software, showing promising results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Machine learning can help EDA tools find optimal routing for wires between chip circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a> and simulate photo mask designs during lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Beyond machine learning, vendors are experimenting with new techniques to adapt to the trend of systems-on-chip (SoC) designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

Ultimately, without EDA software, the cost of creating new chip designs would soar even faster than they already do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. EDA is a critical part of the industry, and today's advanced chips would not exist without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

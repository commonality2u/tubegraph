[[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]] (Microelectromechanical Systems) are microsystems that combine both electric and mechanical functions, built using advanced techniques similar to those for integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Despite the technology's capabilities, the [[challenges_in_mems_production_and_economic_issues | MEMS industry has faced significant economic issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Early Developments and Applications

The dream of creating extremely small devices has a long [[historical_development_of_mems_technology | history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. In 1959, Richard Feynman's lecture, "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom," discussed directly manipulating atoms to create useful tools, even offering a prize for a tiny motor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The first true [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]] product emerged in 1967 when Harvey Nathanson at Westinghouse developed the resonant gate transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This gold transistor, about one millimeter long, was unique because it could move, with researchers controlling the distance between the gate and electrode using electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Its responsiveness to a narrow range of input signals made it useful as a frequency filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

[[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]] gained significant commercial traction in 1979 when Hewlett Packard utilized silicon micro machining techniques to develop a printer inkjet nozzle for thermal inkjet technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. These nozzles represented the technology's most successful application at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Inkjet technology rapidly heats ink to about 100 degrees Celsius, creating tiny bubbles that push ink through the micro machined nozzle onto paper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. While the nozzles themselves are not mechanical, [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]] technology was crucial in their creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, and their small size allowed for high printer resolution by enabling many nozzles to be clustered together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Sensors Revolution in the 1990s

The 1990s marked a major shift for the [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]] industry with the widespread adoption of sensors for acceleration, pressure, and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. These sensors found utility across industrial, medical, and electronics fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Automotive Industry

One of the earliest and most impactful applications was the automotive airbag sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Initially, airbag sensors were large, heavy, complex, and expensive mechanical devices, costing hundreds of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. In 1991, Analog Devices introduced the first commercial acceleration [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]] sensor, which was less than one square centimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This sensor, the ADXL50, integrated the accelerometer and its electronics onto a single silicon chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. It could sense accelerations up to 50 gs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This monolithic system was smaller, more reliable, and significantly cheaper to produce, costing around five dollars compared to the old system's $20-$100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

These accelerometer sensors greatly contributed to the widespread adoption of airbags in cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Modern cars now incorporate dozens of [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]]-based sensor devices for features such as:
*   Anti-lock brakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>
*   Active suspension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
*   Navigation control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   Rollover detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>

Over 60 million [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]]-based airbag sensors alone have been manufactured and sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Medical Sector

The pressure sensor emerged as another significant application of [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]] technology, particularly for monitoring blood pressure in hospitals via a patient's intravenous line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Earlier external blood pressure sensors were costly (over $600) and required sterilization and recalibration for each reuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]] version dramatically reduced the cost to approximately ten dollars, with most of the cost attributed to packaging, making them disposable and much easier to use in medical settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

The [[design_and_manufacturing_processes_of_mems | design]] of these pressure sensors is relatively simple:
1.  Silicon is crafted into a thin membrane acting as a diaphragm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
2.  Four small, stress-sensitive polysilicon resistors (piezoresistors) are placed along the diaphragm's edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
3.  The diaphragm is suspended over a vacuum cavity to form an absolute pressure sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
When pressure is applied, it alters the silicon band structure, changing the crystal's resistivity, which is then sensed and relayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Today, the medical [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]]-based sensor industry is valued at over six billion dollars, with blood pressure sensors comprising the largest segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Modern Consumer Electronics

Building on initial pressure sensor and accelerometer [[design_and_manufacturing_processes_of_mems | designs]], manufacturers have created a variety of versatile, low-power inertial [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]]-based sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. These are now integrated into many popular consumer electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. For example, the Nintendo Switch console and its controllers incorporate ultra-low power inertial sensors with both gyroscope and accelerometer capabilities (e.g., the STMicroelectronics SH-627) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

[[design_and_manufacturing_processes_of_mems | MEMS]] micro machining technologies are also applied in other consumer electronics products, including:
*   Visual displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>
*   Optical switches, which use micro mirrors to redirect light between optical fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>

## Production Workflow and Challenges

The primary approach for commercial [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]] production workflows involves using high-volume integrated circuit (IC) techniques like photolithography and etching to add or remove layers on a 2D substrate, creating a 3D shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. However, there is no universal [[design_and_manufacturing_processes_of_mems | methodology]] for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, leading companies to explore other [[design_and_manufacturing_processes_of_mems | micro machining methods]] such as:
*   Electrochemical micro machining (ECM), which etches metals locally and selectively with an electrode tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   Laser beam machining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   Electrode discharge machining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   LIGA (a German acronym for X-ray lithography, electroforming, and molding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

These [[design_and_manufacturing_processes_of_mems | manufacturing]] costs are critical as they set a high hurdle for payback and profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Beyond fabrication, [[design_and_manufacturing_processes_of_mems | design]] and back-end steps (testing and packaging) also significantly contribute to cost and production issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

[[design_and_manufacturing_processes_of_mems | Designing MEMS]] is specialized; simply miniaturizing existing designs does not work due to different physical phenomena at the micro-scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. For instance, friction forces are much stronger than inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, and tiny flow spaces are prone to fluid blockages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Conversely, some biochips can use electro-osmotic effects to pump reactants, which is only possible at a micrometer scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

Unlike VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) semiconductor [[design_and_manufacturing_processes_of_mems | design]], which uses modular approaches with standardized cell libraries to ensure yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, mechanical [[design_and_manufacturing_processes_of_mems | design]] (including [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]]) lacks such standardization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]] components must accommodate specific weight, space, and energy restrictions tailored to each product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. While ICs primarily process signals, mechanical objects may need to contain liquids, rotate, slide, or support loads simultaneously, making [[design_and_manufacturing_processes_of_mems | MEMS design]] highly custom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Companies like CoventorWare and IntelliCAD are developing CAD and [[design_and_manufacturing_processes_of_mems | design]] automation software suites to help [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]] designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Packaging and testing, the "back end" of the semiconductor production process, are vital but often unheralded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. For a [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]]-based sensor, packaging constitutes 75-80% of the final cost, a stark contrast to integrated chips where packaging is a secondary support role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This is because [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]] must intimately interact with the outside world, requiring unique packaging for each application (e.g., a pressure sensor needs different packaging than a micro mirror array) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This adds substantial engineering and production costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

Despite these [[challenges_in_mems_production_and_economic_issues | challenges]], [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]] are seen as a "second silicon revolution," enabling microscopic moving parts that perform functions of much larger devices, being smaller, cheaper, and more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

## Potential and Future Applications

The [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]] industry holds promise for exciting future possibilities, including:
*   Micropropulsion technologies for small cube satellites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>
*   [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]]-based LiDAR mirrors for autonomous cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>
*   IoT (Internet of Things) sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>

To fully realize its technical and commercial potential, the diverse players in the [[introduction_to_mems_and_their_applications | MEMS]] industry—designers, foundries, vendors, and end-users—need to collaborate more closely to establish standards and address under-invested issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

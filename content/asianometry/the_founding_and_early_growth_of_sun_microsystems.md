[[history_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] emerged in Silicon Valley with a remarkable business model and rapid expansion, eventually becoming an iconic company valued at approximately $140 billion at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This article focuses on its beginnings and initial ascent.

## The Stanford University Network Project

The genesis of Sun Microsystems began in 1978 when Andreas "Andy" Bechtolsheim, a Stanford student from Germany, worked as a consultant for the Xerox Park research laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. There, he observed Alto computers networked together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. At the time, chip designs were starting to be done on computers, but individual designers lacked sufficiently powerful machines to run the necessary software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Bechtolsheim believed that powerful personal computers, similar to the Alto, would be far more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

Since Xerox showed no interest in commercializing Park's innovations, Bechtolsheim decided to build his own version at Stanford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. In 1981, he joined a project to develop low-cost personal workstations for computer-aided design (CAD) work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The hardware for this project was based on the Motorola 68000 chip, the first commercially available 32-bit microprocessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The project, and its first workstation, was named SUN, standing for Stanford University Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The Sun-1 workstation featured a bitmap display akin to the Alto and an Ethernet connection for networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. A few years later, it would run an older version of [[The creation and development of Unix | Unix]], specifically [[The creation and development of Unix | Unix]] System 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

By 1981, Bechtolsheim and his team were producing these computers in significant numbers, printing custom circuit boards in Margaret Jack's Hall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. However, Stanford terminated the project just as it gained commercial momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Bechtolsheim then licensed the Sun hardware design to a few customers, charging $10,000 each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. These licensees, however, were not interested in building the powerful personal workstation Bechtolsheim envisioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Founding Sun Microsystems

To realize his vision, Bechtolsheim sought to assemble a team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. A secretary connected him with Vinod Khosla, another Stanford alum with an MBA and a background as a serial entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Khosla had previously worked at Daisy Systems, a pioneer in the electronic design automation (EDA) market, which failed partly due to a lack of sufficient hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Khosla recognized that these workstations could fulfill that need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. He and Bechtolsheim drafted a six-page business plan, outlining a strategy to build and sell Sun workstations priced between $25,000 and $100,000 (equivalent to approximately $75,000 to $300,000 in 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

They recruited two more co-founders:
*   **Scott McNealy**: A Harvard graduate and good friend of Khosla, with whom he had previously worked on a failed startup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Bill Joy**: A grad student at UC Berkeley known for his work on the Berkeley Software Distribution of the [[The creation and development of Unix | Unix]] operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Joy joined six months later to work on software product design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

McNealy approached venture capitalists UC Ventures and West Coast Ventures, quickly securing funding after demonstrating the workstation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Kleiner Perkins and August Capital also joined in later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

[[history_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] officially opened its doors in February 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Khosla served as CEO, McNealy as VP of manufacturing, and Bechtolsheim handled hardware product design, with Joy later joining him on the software side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## The Workstation Product Category and Sun's Approach

Before workstations, individuals needing significant computing power, such as for CAD work, had to reserve time on larger "mini computers" and communicate with them via terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. These mini computers, though smaller and cheaper than mainframes, still cost over $25,000 at the time (around $190,000 today) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Sun's initial vision and product were akin to a high-end desktop computer, possessing more power than typical consumer computers, sufficient to run complex CAD software, yet affordable enough for a professional to own individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Early Success and Growth

[[history_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] had orders even before its official launch, as universities and research institutions had heard of the original Sun project at Stanford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Interest surged further when Bill Joy joined and it was announced that the workstation would run the [[The spread of Unix to universities and its adoption into industry | Berkeley Unix]] operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

The team worked relentlessly to design and ship their new workstations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Their first workstation had 256 kilobytes of memory and sold for approximately $8,000-$10,000, achieving a 50% gross margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The Sun-2, with improved specifications and [[The spread of Unix to universities and its adoption into industry | Berkeley Unix]] pre-installed, followed later that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Sun's primary competitor was Apollo Computer, which had started a year before Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. While Apollo had superior hardware, Sun's advantage lay in leveraging open and readily available resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Their initial workstations were built from off-the-shelf components: standard power supplies, Motorola microprocessors, and Fujitsu disk drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. For software, they used the off-the-shelf [[The creation and development of Unix | Berkeley Unix]] operating system, which later evolved into SunOS and then Solaris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. For networking, they adopted TCP/IP, which had recently been standardized for military computer networking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This networking capability was crucial as it allowed users to collaborate from their own spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

This "open business model" enabled Sun to produce widely adopted technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Their vision of selling standardized, widely compatible computers — "one workstation for each user" — resonated with customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Sun became profitable by May 1982, just three months after opening its doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. In its first fiscal year, it generated $8.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Revenue soared to $39 million the following year, and then to $115 million the year after that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

Managing this rapid growth proved challenging for the young leadership team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The board recruited Owen Brown, a 42-year-old, for his experience, but he clashed with Khosla and soon left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Scott McNealy took over as interim CEO and, despite his youth, effectively led the company, eventually being confirmed as its permanent leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Khosla departed Sun in 1985 to join John Doerr at Kleiner Perkins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

From 1982 to 1987, Sun doubled the number of workstations it shipped every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. In 1985, they launched the Sun-3 workstation series, featuring an upgraded Motorola MC68020 processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The Sun-3 also introduced the Network File System (NFS), a new distributed file system standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Sun licensed the NFS code for a nominal fee, helping it become a widely adopted standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. The Sun-3 was an immediate success, accounting for one-third of total sales in the quarter following its September 1985 release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. To manage new orders, Sun opened a new factory in Milpitas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

By 1987, Sun had surpassed Apollo Computer, which had pioneered the personal workstation market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Despite Apollo having better hardware, customers preferred Sun's more affordable computers, with the Sun-3 being 15% cheaper than Apollo's offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Apollo was eventually acquired by Hewlett-Packard in April 1989 and subsequently shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## Initial Public Offering and Core Philosophy

In March 1986, Sun conducted its Initial Public Offering (IPO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. With $210 million in revenue, they raised $45 million, marking the largest tech IPO in three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Sun's first annual report highlighted its core philosophy:
> "Our rejection of proprietary systems in order to concentrate on our model of distributed computing technology standards and high quality is itself an innovation and in a very real sense this is Sun's proprietary product." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>

From 1986 to 1988, Sun's revenues quintupled, growing from $210 million to $1.1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Internal Innovation: The SPARC CPU

Despite its rapid growth, Sun encountered a problem with one of its critical partners: Motorola, which supplied Sun's microprocessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Motorola's single design team struggled to keep pace with Sun's demands; a memory bug took two years to fix, and it took equally long to increase clock speed from 10 MHz to 12 MHz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

After an unsuccessful test of an Intel-compatible workstation, Bill Joy proposed designing their own microprocessor based on a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture, which IBM had recently documented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The key principle of RISC is that each instruction performs only one function, which IBM claimed could potentially speed things up fourfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

In 1987, a team led by Anant Agra finalized the SPARC CPU, fabricated by Fujitsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. It proved significantly faster than competing offerings and was subsequently integrated into Sun's next major workstations, the Sun-4 or SPARCstation series, released in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Sun largely earned its revenue by selling these systems, leveraging open, off-the-shelf parts to create high-powered workstations for specialized technical, government, corporate, and Wall Street applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

After World War II, the Soviet Union recognized the critical importance of oil and petroleum, leading them to strategically control as much of these resources as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

## Initial Expansion and Resource Acquisition
The Soviet Union's postwar strategic goals were reflected in its occupied territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. They occupied Romania and temporarily controlled Austria's oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. The Soviet Union relied on imported oil from these two countries until the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

To revitalize production, the Red Army confiscated oil technologies, much of which had been sourced from the West, and sent them back to the Soviet Union as war booty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. There was a particularly high demand for pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

## Focus on the Volga-Ural Basin
Throughout the 1950s, the Soviets significantly invested in developing the oil fields of the Volga-Ural Basin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Baku, once the primary oil region, was no longer the priority, leading to a decline in its production rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

By the end of the 1950s, this investment paid off, with fields like Romashkino (4,200 square kilometers, six times the size of Singapore) producing more oil than all other regions of the country combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The Volga-Ural Basin remains a significant oil production area to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

## Oil as a Political Tool
As production expanded, the Soviets began exporting energy to other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. Initially, this was done to earn foreign currency for purchasing goods like wheat, meat, or advanced technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. However, over time, the Soviets increasingly used energy exports to exert their political influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. It became leverage to keep their satellite states and allies in line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

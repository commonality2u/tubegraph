The development of domestic alternatives to American semiconductor technologies, particularly X86 processors, is a significant focus for China, driven by national security and geopolitical concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This ambition stems from several factors, including a desire to reduce reliance on foreign technology and to secure critical industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Reasons for China's Domestic Semiconductor Drive

China's push for homegrown semiconductor technology is multifaceted:
*   **Espionage Concerns** The Edward Snowden revelations regarding American spying on foreign allies and competitors raised significant alarm globally, leading countries to scrutinize the implementation of American technologies in critical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Geopolitical Competition** The past era of cooperation between the US and China, which followed the Sino-Soviet split, has ended, replaced by heightened tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **National Champions** China aims to cultivate its own "national champions" in key industries like high-speed rail, solar, space, and now, computer chips, driven by national and patriotic pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.
*   **US Sanctions and Restrictions** The Trump administration's actions, such as cutting off companies like Huawei from access to American technologies, intensified China's fears and spurred on its efforts to achieve technological self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This has led to China's interest in having domestic X86 chips available to supply its large user base in a worst-case scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

## X86 Instruction Set and Market Dynamics

X86 refers to a family of instruction set architectures (ISA), which chip design companies implement to create CPU microarchitectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. While different companies can share ISAs, their implementations can lead to radically different designs and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Intel initially developed and popularized X86, but licensed it to other companies like AMD due to reasons including anti-competitive concerns and the need for second sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

Most CPUs for PCs, game consoles, and servers today are X86, known for handling compute-intensive tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. X86 CPUs power 481 of the world's top 500 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. China is a massive market for X86 chip manufacturers, with Intel selling $20 billion worth of processors to China in 2020 and AMD selling $2.3 billion, figures comparable to or higher than their sales in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## Chinese Homegrown X86 Efforts

China has two distinct lineages of homegrown X86 chips available in its market: Zhaoxin and Haigong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

### Zhaoxin

Zhaoxin is a joint venture between the Shanghai municipal government and Taiwanese company Via Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. Via Technologies acquired an X86 architectural license through its 1999 purchases of Cyrix and Centaur Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Via's acquisition of Centaur led to a patent battle with Intel, which concluded with a 10-year cross-license agreement in 2003, extended by a three-year grace period in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

Zhaoxin has been releasing CPUs since 2014, marketing them as domestically made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Their architectures are direct descendants of Centaur Technologies' work, with their 2015 third-generation ZXC architecture believed to be identical to Centaur's Isaiah 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. The latest sixth-generation Zhaoxin Luchajoy chips, while serving China's low-end needs, are estimated to be four to eight years behind the latest American designs in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. Zhaoxin, a fabless company, has been transitioning from TSMC to mainland alternatives like SMIC for fabrication, which may be causing delays and performance loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. Zhaoxin has also announced intentions to enter the discrete GPU market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.

### Haigong (AMD Joint Venture)

In 2015, AMD formed a two-layer joint venture, collectively called Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co-limited (THATIC), to provide the Chinese market with a version of its Zen 1 X86 chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. This deal, valued at over $200 million, was structured to allow the Chinese to claim the chips as homegrown while AMD maintained control over its core IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.

The joint venture structure involved:
*   **Haiguang Micro Electronics (HMC)**: 51% owned by AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.
*   **Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit Design Company (Haigong)**: AMD owns 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

AMD created IP for a special X86 server chip for HMC, which then removed sensitive elements before handing it to Haigong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. Haigong made changes and designed the top-level architecture before returning the chip to HMC/AMD for approval, finishing, and fabrication at GlobalFoundries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>. The final chips are then given to Haigong for packaging and sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

While AMD stated it briefed and received a "green light" from various US government bodies, including the Department of Defense and Commerce, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Department of Defense ultimately disagreed with the deal, despite Treasury's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. AMD informed the US government that the chips would be used strictly for commercial purposes, but Chinese job postings and interviews suggested their use in new exascale supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>. The complex structure of the joint venture, while designed for PR, could also make detecting inadvertent technology transfers more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Technology Transfer Management
> The setup for the AMD-Haigong joint venture appears to adhere to best practices for managing foreign technology joint ventures by keeping the most valuable and newer parts of the IP with the majority owner and licensing older technologies to the partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

In 2019, THATIC was placed on an entity list, and AMD agreed not to engage in further technology transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. While THATIC still possesses the original IP, AMD has moved on to selling its fourth-generation Zen 3 chips, which are significantly better than the older licensed technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. The design from the joint venture would be difficult to reverse engineer or port to a non-US foundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications for [[Global semiconductor supply chain and geopolitical tensions | global semiconductor supply chain and geopolitical tensions]]

From an American perspective, the transfer of X86 technology to China, given its perceived value and importance to national catch-up strategies, naturally raises some alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. Intel's potential opening up of X86 IP to foundry customers under its Foundry 2.0 initiative presents an interesting development, with questions about whether Chinese fabless companies would be allowed to create X86 chips using this service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

However, concerns about these [[implications_of_chinese_semiconductor_advancements | Chinese semiconductor advancements]] leading to a loss of American semiconductor leadership might be overstated through X86 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. X86 no longer holds the singular dominance it once did, with ARM making significant inroads into areas traditionally dominated by X86, such as desktops and servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.

In China, X86 development remains a niche within [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's indigenous semiconductor efforts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. Any chips made in this area are primarily for domestic consumption due to potential litigation concerns and lack of international competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. China's main focus is on ARM, with an estimated 95% of computer chips designed in China being ARM-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. RISC-V, an open-source instruction set, is also gaining traction, backed by major players like Alibaba Cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.

While Chinese X86 chips are interesting, they generally lag years behind their American competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. Their impact is likely to be limited as long as Intel's and AMD's chips remain available in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.

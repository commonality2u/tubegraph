During the Meiji Restoration, Japan's government established numerous state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to rapidly industrialize the nation and avoid Western colonization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:49">[02:24:49]</a>. These SOEs aimed to build entire supply chains, from iron foundries for weapons to railways for transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:37">[02:36:37]</a>. They were founded across various sectors, including railways, breweries, cement, textiles, shipbuilding, and weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:14">[02:53:14]</a>. The primary goal was to foster industrial capacity to replace imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:14">[03:00:14]</a>. These enterprises were not initially expected to be profitable; their losses were covered by the government, which had nationalized Japan's mines, declaring all underground minerals state property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:07">[03:09:07]</a>.

## Challenges and Early Attempts at Privatization
By the late 1870s, the financial strain from these money-losing SOEs threatened to bankrupt the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Consequently, in the early 1880s, the government attempted to transfer these state-managed assets to private hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:07">[03:26:07]</a>. Initially, many unprofitable SOEs were offered at book value, but they failed to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:04">[03:32:04]</a>.

## Successful Privatization and Its Impact
A failed privatization round in 1880 led to a new approach four years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>. In 1884, the government included some of its profitable SOEs, most notably the nationalized mines, for sale to the highest bidder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:04">[03:42:04]</a>. The mines, along with various SOEs in shipbuilding, ironworks, and cement manufacturing, were successfully sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:09">[03:50:09]</a>.

The mines, though exploited for centuries, had dwindled in output due to flooding and technical limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:06">[04:01:06]</a>. Foreign experts introduced steam power pumps, explosives, and vertical shafts, which successfully revitalized their output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">[04:07:07]</a>. Out of the 21 largest privatization sales, 11 involved mining, including the crown jewel Mikay coal mine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:21">[04:20:21]</a>. The Mikay sale in August 1888 alone yielded more than all other previous sales combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:16">[04:28:16]</a>.

This injection of foreign technology unlocked significant value, but it resulted in a massive transfer of public assets into private hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:09">[04:36:09]</a>. This move is considered to be on par with the creation of the [[nationalization_of_banks_and_industries_in_early_soviet_russia | Russian oligarchs]] in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:03">[04:44:03]</a>.

## Rise of the [[Zaibatsu and Japanese economy | Zaibatsu]]
The merchant families who acquired these assets and benefited from them went on to create the [[Zaibatsu and Japanese economy | zaibatsu]], meaning "financial clan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:03">[04:49:03]</a>. While merchant trading houses existed before the Meiji Restoration, the turbulent changes of the era presented unique opportunities for families with the right connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:05">[05:06:05]</a>. Top-tier [[Zaibatsu and Japanese economy | zaibatsu]] like Mitsubishi and Sumitomo had roots in the shogun days, while "second-tier" groups like Nissan, Furukawa, and Kawasaki emerged after the Russo-Japanese War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:07">[05:27:07]</a>.

These families typically controlled holding companies that, in turn, managed numerous subsidiary businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:08">[05:43:08]</a>. Their pathway to immense wealth involved acquiring exclusive rights to or purchasing vast natural resources, then using the profits to fund expansions into other sectors of the Japanese economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:01">[06:03:01]</a>. For example, the Mitsui family, already wealthy, switched allegiance to the new Meiji government in 1867. They helped raise funding and currency reform, leading to lucrative concessions for financial services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:17">[06:30:17]</a>. Their financial resources enabled them to acquire several mines, including the Mikay coal mine, forming the foundation of their vast wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:07">[06:53:07]</a>. Mitsui then established businesses like Mitsui Bank, Mitsui Mining, and Mitsui Bussan (a general trading company), which expanded into a self-contained mini-economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:07">[07:03:07]</a>.

By the 1920s, as natural resource cash cows declined, [[Zaibatsu and Japanese economy | zaibatsu]] families sought capital from the stock market, selling minority stakes in subsidiaries while retaining controlling blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:01">[07:49:01]</a>. This unlocked significant capital, used to acquire more revenue-generating assets like farmland and residential complexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:08">[08:12:08]</a>. Rents and high-yielding financial assets generated incredible passive income, contributing to extreme wealth inequality where the top 1% wealth grew 3.5 times faster than the national average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:19">[08:24:19]</a>. The government tolerated this due to the [[Zaibatsu and Japanese economy | zaibatsu]]'s role in driving industrialization and later, militarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:24">[08:43:24]</a>.

## Post-War Restructuring
The unchecked expansion of [[Zaibatsu and Japanese economy | zaibatsu]] combines led to their dominance over the domestic economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:44">[07:36:44]</a>. However, after World War II, under the occupation authorities, significant [[postwar_economic_reforms_in_japan | reforms]] were instituted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:15">[10:04:15]</a>. These included:
*   **Confiscation and Redistribution of Land**: Starting in 1938 and continuing after the war, agricultural land was taken from landlords and given to tenant farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:04">[10:42:04]</a>. This "accidental land reform" significantly reduced the rental income of the [[Zaibatsu and Japanese economy | zaibatsu]] families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:04">[10:55:04]</a>.
*   **Capital Tax**: In 1946, a tax on capital was instituted to pay off government debt, with [[Zaibatsu and Japanese economy | zaibatsu]] families' taxable assets taxed at an 85% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:07">[11:06:07]</a>.
*   **Dissolution of [[Zaibatsu and Japanese economy | Zaibatsu]]**: In September 1946, trust-busting economists ordered the dissolution of [[Zaibatsu and Japanese economy | zaibatsu]], targeting 10 families, including the biggest ones like Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Yasuda, and Sumitomo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:07">[11:33:07]</a>. Their holding companies' stocks and bonds were confiscated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:15">[12:02:15]</a>.
*   **Executive Purges**: In 1947 and 1948, family executives and their associates were removed from their company positions, affecting nearly 2,000 executives and hundreds of businesses in the first round, and significantly more in a second purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

While the families received cash compensation for acquired assets, proceeds were deposited into a national bank with withdrawal limits to prevent re-acquisition of controlling stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:34">[14:17:34]</a>. The ultimate blow to their wealth was hyperinflation between 1946 and 1951, which caused the real value of their cash holdings to plummet by 97% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:13">[15:18:13]</a>. By 1950, the wealth of Japan's richest families was drastically reduced, and the top 1% of earners derived half their income from employment, rather than passive assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:26">[15:36:26]</a>.

## Long-Term Effects
The post-war reforms, while not a "communist takeover," largely stripped the [[Zaibatsu and Japanese economy | zaibatsu]] families of their plutocratic control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:06">[13:55:06]</a>. The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) gained de facto policy and guidance control over Japan's corporate apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:14">[16:09:14]</a>. This reset fundamentally shifted Japan's economic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:33">[16:47:33]</a>. Rather than focusing on dominating the domestic market and suppressing competition, Japanese companies, now led by professional managers, focused outwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:15">[16:57:15]</a>. They pioneered an export-driven "catch-up strategy": acquiring and mastering foreign technology to create products for the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:24">[17:08:24]</a>. This export discipline was crucial in creating the [[japanese_exportdriven_economic_miracle | Japanese economic miracle]] of the 1950s and 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:44">[17:23:44]</a>.

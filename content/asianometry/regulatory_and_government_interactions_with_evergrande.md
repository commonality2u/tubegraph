The relationship between Evergrande and the Chinese government has been a significant factor in the company's operations and current challenges.

## Early Government Support
From its inception, Evergrande relied on government flexibility to acquire land and initiate projects. For its first major project, Jinbe Garden, Evergrande convinced the government to allow them to purchase the plot in installments due to the company's inability to afford the required 5 million RMB down payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This marked the beginning of Evergrande's reliance on debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Shu Jian's Political Connections
Evergrande's founder, Shu Jian, is noted for his close ties to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. He is considered China's most generous individual in terms of charity, winning the China Charity Award for eight consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. In 2018 and 2019, he donated an estimated 4 billion RMB (620 million USD) in cash annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>, which is believed to have cultivated strong connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. Shu leveraged these ties to navigate business opportunities and defend against critics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

### Confrontation with Citron Research
An example of Shu's influence was seen in the case against American short-selling firm Citron Research. After Andrew Left of Citron Research published a report in June 2012 claiming Evergrande was insolvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, the Hong Kong authorities initiated a years-long civil case against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. In 2016, Left was banned from trading in Hong Kong for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>, and his final appeal was lost in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. Left later stated he would not have challenged Evergrande if he had known how powerful Shu was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

## Government Policies and Strategic Shifts
Evergrande's business strategies often aligned with or responded to Chinese government directives.

### De-leveraging the Economy
In 2017, Shu announced a new business strategy for Evergrande: "three lows, one high" (low debt, low leverage, low cost, high turnover) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. This was a direct reversal of their previous "three highs, one low" strategy and aimed to lower debt ratios and raise net assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This shift was explicitly in line with recent pronouncements by the Chinese government regarding de-leveraging the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

### Focus on High-Tech Industries
Following the US crippling of Chinese telecommunications company ZTE in 2018 through technology export sanctions, the Chinese government reshuffled its priorities due to the domestic industry's over-reliance on American technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Seizing this opportunity, Shu announced in 2018 that Evergrande would enter the high-tech industry, including quantum computing, AI, life sciences, and new energy vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.

## The "Three Red Lines" Policy
In August 2020, to address the risk of contagion in its financial sector, two Chinese ministries passed regulations mandating "the three red lines" for real estate companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. This policy aimed to curb the reliance of massive Chinese conglomerates, including Evergrande, on borrowed money and undisclosed off-balance sheet arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

The "three red lines" are:
1.  A liabilities-to-assets ratio ceiling of 70% (excluding advances from contracted projects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
2.  A cap on the net debt-to-equity ratio of 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.
3.  A requirement to hold at least one dollar of cash for each dollar borrowed in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.

Companies failing to meet these requirements would be barred from adding more debt to their books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>, a severe punishment for debt-reliant companies like Evergrande <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>.

At the time the law passed, Evergrande's metrics were:
*   Liabilities-to-asset ratio: 82% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>.
*   Net debt-to-equity ratio: 199% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.
*   Ratio of cash to short-term borrowings: 0.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

This policy caught Evergrande off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. In response, Shu announced that Evergrande would slash pricing on its 600 new builds nationwide by 30% to achieve high monthly sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

## Request for Government Support
In September 2020, a leaked letter sent by Evergrande to the Guangdong provincial government, titled "Report on Requesting Support for Major Asset Restructuring Projects," highlighted the company's dire financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. While Evergrande denied its authenticity, the market believed it to be real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>.

The letter stated that Evergrande's interest-bearing liabilities had reached approximately 835 billion RMB (130 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>. It also detailed significant amounts owed to 128 domestic banks (232 billion RMB / 35.8 billion USD) and 121 non-banking entities (368 billion RMB / 56.9 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>. The report requested the government's help in coordinating a reorganization of Evergrande's entities, warning that failure to complete it by February 2021 would trigger repayments of 130 billion RMB (20 billion USD) to strategic investors and 13.7 billion RMB (2.2 billion USD) in dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>.

## Government's Stance on Bailout
Despite the significant debt, many analysts believe the Chinese government will not bail out Evergrande like a bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>. Instead, the company is expected to undergo debt resolution through court and be slowly broken up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. The government's goal of lower real estate prices aligns with its overarching social equality goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.

The primary concern for the government is preventing a systemic crisis of confidence due to Evergrande's off-balance sheet liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. Chinese regulators have a track record of handling other massive conglomerates in crisis, such as Anbang Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. There is also the question of whether Shu will face charges for causing social unrest, similar to figures like Wu Xiaohui of Anbang Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.

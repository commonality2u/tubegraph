The need for specialized robots in managing nuclear disasters became evident after major incidents, as they can perform critical tasks in areas inaccessible to humans due to high radiation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This article examines the [[Robotics in nuclear disaster response|development and deployment of robots in nuclear disaster response]] throughout history, from early prototypes to the advanced machines used at Fukushima.

## Early Developments: Three Mile Island (1979)

The first nuclear response robots were developed by the United States following the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Their purpose was site inspection in high-radiation areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Notable Robots
*   **Surveillance and In-Service Inspection Robot (SISI)**: First deployed in August 1982, three years after the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This crawler-like robot took photographs, collected samples, and made radiation readings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Fred**: Introduced a year after SISI, Fred was equipped with a high-pressure water spray for decontamination work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Remote Reconnaissance Vehicles (RRVs)**: Three RRVs were built and deployed to de-fuel the Three Mile Island reactor core, which was flooded with radioactive water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

These early robots were designed to be practical, tethered, small, and built with familiar technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. They successfully performed tasks like flushing, scraping, and cleaning walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Chernobyl Disaster (1986)

After the Chernobyl disaster, the Soviet Union initially relied on hundreds of thousands of human "liquidators" to clean up rubble and debris, dubbed "biorobots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This was due to extremely high radiation levels causing available robots to fail, as well as bureaucratic issues that reportedly prevented the use of helicopters for debris removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Robots were eventually brought in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>:
*   **Specialized Transport Robot (STR-1)**: A wirelessly controlled bulldozer adapted from an unmanned lunar vehicle, used for removing debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Accident (2011)

In March 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent tsunami disabled the cooling systems of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, leading to meltdowns and hydrogen explosions in units 1-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Units 4, 5, and 6 sustained less damage, with units 5 and 6 being essentially fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The plant owner, TEPCO, and the Japanese government committed billions to decommissioning the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Initial Response: American Robots
The first robot arrived at Fukushima in April 2011, three weeks after the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Pakbot**: Four military multipurpose robots from American company iRobot Corporation USA were deployed to enter the damaged and irradiated unit 1, 2, and 3 reactor buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Pakbot, previously used in Iraq and Afghanistan for detecting and diffusing improvised explosive devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, weighed about 30 kilograms and looked like metal extension arms on a tread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. They measured radiation dosage, atmospheric temperatures, and oxygen concentrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Warrior**: A larger iRobot machine used for additional cleaning work, vacuuming and clearing obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **T-Hawk**: A small unmanned aerial vehicle from Honeywell, which flew over units one through four to review the situation and collect dust samples from April 10th to July 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Other cleaner robots included Bobcat and the Swedish-built Brokk 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Japanese Robot Development and Challenges

The initial reliance on American robots sparked mild controversy, given Japan's reputation for robotics technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) "Rescue Robots"**: After a 1999 criticality accident, three Japanese technology centers developed nuclear disaster robots, including JAEA's "remote surveillance squad" or "rescue robots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. However, these robots received little to no upgrades after their 2001 completion due to a lack of budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. When the Fukushima accident occurred, they were not ready; many critical components were out of stock, and there were no trained operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
    *   **JAEA-3**: Over subsequent months, JAEA re-engineered the rescue robot into the JAEA-3, grafting on parts from Brokk robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. It began missions in September 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

*   **Kinsei Series**: TEPCO turned to search and rescue robots developed by the NITTO project at the Chiba Institute of Technology, called the Kinsei series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. While Kinsei had continuous tracks and was designed to be waterproof and highly mobile, TEPCO requested modifications for radiation hardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### [[Challenges faced by robots in highradiation areas|Radiation Hardening]]
Nuclear accidents release various forms of radiation, including alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, x-rays, and neutron particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. These can damage semiconductors in two main ways:
1.  **Displacement Effect**: Particles like neutrons and alpha particles displace atoms in semiconductors, changing device properties and leading to higher current leakage or decreased lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
2.  **Ionization Effect**: Electrons, protons, and x-rays create hole pairs, causing permanent glitches and erratic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

Damage can occur at device, circuit, and system levels, necessitating radiation hardening at all these levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Device Level**: Modifying transistor layout, adding insulating substrates (like silicon on insulator fabrication), or making devices larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Circuit Level**: Duplicating critical circuits or adding monitoring circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **System Level**: Adding radiation armor and redundancies, and introducing preventive scrubbing algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Gamma ray testing showed Kinsei's essential components could survive about 200 grays (20,000 rads), allowing it to work for over 100 hours with a 10% chance of failure in Fukushima's 100-gray environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Kinsei entered reactor buildings in June 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Kinsei 1 was abandoned in October 2011 due to a broken communications link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, but Kinsei 2 and 3 were redesigned to fix this flaw and deployed in February 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Long-term Decommissioning at Fukushima

The long-term goals for Fukushima include decommissioning the plant and rebuilding the surrounding area, a multi-step process overseen by TEPCO and the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning (IRID) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### Cleanup and Decontamination Robots
*   **Astaco-Sora**: A heavy-duty robot developed by Hitachi to remove rubble scattered by hydrogen explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Raccoon and Arounder**: Smaller cleaner bots that spray the ground around Reactor Unit 2 with high-pressure water or dry ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Meister**: A heavy-duty robot capable of drilling for samples or vacuuming particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

### Spent Fuel Removal
TEPCO successfully removed 1,535 spent fuel rods from the damaged Unit 4 reactor pool by December 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Removal of 566 spent fuel rods from Unit 3 began in 2019 and was completed by February 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Removal for Units 1 and 2 is scheduled to start in 2023 or beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### Nuclear Fuel Debris (Corium) Inspection and Removal
The melted fuel (corium) in Units 1-3 burned through the reactor pressure vessel and concrete pedestal, reaching the primary containment vessel before being cooled and resolidifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. IRID developed different robots to investigate each reactor due to unique circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

*   **Unit 1**: Flooded to 2 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
    *   **P-morph**: A morphing robot designed to squeeze through a 100 mm hole and then transform into a U-shape to travel around a lead plate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. An initial deployment in 2014 encountered an unexpected obstacle, but improvements led to mission completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The next step is to collect the pebble-like debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   **Unit 2**: Intact building structure due to no hydrogen explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
    *   **Scorpion**: A robot that can crawl through a small hole and reconfigure itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Deployed in 2017, its left tread failed, and it was left inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. The interior was finally photographed with a camera hanging off a fishing rod, stitched into a panorama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Unit 3**: PCV almost entirely flooded to about 6 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
    *   **Mini Manbo**: A tiny robot (13 cm across, 30 cm long) nicknamed "little sunfish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. It successfully recorded video of the nuclear debris in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

IRID and TEPCO plan to begin collecting and removing nuclear fuel debris from Unit 2 first, using a massive stainless steel robotic arm that will reach into the PCV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This project's start has been delayed into 2023 to improve the arm's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. IRID expects debris removal to take at least 10 years, with further cleaning and decontamination work beyond that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

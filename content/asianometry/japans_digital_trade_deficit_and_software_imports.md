From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

In 2023, Japan recorded a significant digital trade deficit of approximately 5.5 trillion yen, equivalent to $37 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This deficit indicates that Japan imported trillions more yen in software licenses, cloud services, and other digital services than it exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The deficit has been growing, with the 2023 amount being twice that of 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

While Japan is renowned for its iconic electronics hardware companies such as Sony, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Panasonic, Canon, [[rise_and_decline_of_japans_sharp_corporation | Sharp]], and Toshiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, it conspicuously lacks major global software players like Microsoft, Oracle, Adobe, or SAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Beginnings: MITI and IBM's Influence

Throughout the 20th century, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) actively pursued the development of its computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Their primary competitor and concern was [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] first entered Japan in 1925, selling tabulating machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. A subsidiary, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] Japan, was established in 1937 but had its assets confiscated during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Upon [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s return in 1949, a new Japanese law mandated joint ventures (JVs) for all foreign computer companies with local firms, essentially forcing technology transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. However, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] maintained 100% ownership of [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] Japan, refusing to comply with government demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. MITI and [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] Japan frequently clashed over market entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, with Japanese officials pushing customers towards local products and leveraging import licenses to enforce this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Despite these pressures, Japanese customers continued to favor [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] products due to their clear technical superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Japan Software Company

In 1964, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] introduced its groundbreaking System/360 line of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This prompted MITI to sponsor the [[the_history_of_japans_computer_and_software_industry | Super High-Performance Computer Project]] from 1966 to 1971, aiming to surpass the System/360 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. While previous MITI efforts focused solely on hardware, the System/360's emphasis on software compatibility meant software could no longer be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

To develop software for this project, MITI sponsored the Japan Software Company (日本ソフトウェア) in October 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This joint venture included Hitachi, NEC, Fujitsu, and the Industrial Bank of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Its goal was to create a "common language" software and universal operating system for all Japanese computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. However, MITI only funded 25% of the project's 10 billion yen budget, indicating software was an afterthought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

The Japan Software Company failed to achieve its ambitious goals due to ballooning requirements and lack of external sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. It closed in 1972 after government subsidies ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Unbundling and "Little IBMs"

Paradoxically, Japanese hardware makers often used [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. In 1969, facing an American anti-trust lawsuit, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] unbundled its software and hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Previously, software was part of an overall computing services bundle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This unbundling assigned a price to software, allowing smaller companies to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, thereby creating the software industry as it is known today in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

In Japan, however, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s unbundling led Japanese computer makers to set up software subsidiaries and "adopt" [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s specifications via reverse-engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. As early as 1971, Fujitsu began selling an "[[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]-compatible" mainframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. These companies frequently modified [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] software to display Japanese kanji symbols and integrate with customer-specific business practices, effectively locking in customers and charging more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This effectively turned Japanese computer companies into "little [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBMs]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## The [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] Spy Case

The reverse-engineering of [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] software was, in fact, illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. For over a decade, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] did little due to the lack of definitive copyright protections for software until the Copyright Act of 1976 and its 1978 amendments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, and its defense against a titanic anti-trust case which ended in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Once the anti-trust case was resolved, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] turned its attention to the software theft by Japanese companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. In 1982, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] confronted Fujitsu, Hitachi, and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Japanese firms argued that System/360 OS was in the public domain and that [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s specifications were a standard, not subject to copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

The "[[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] Spy Case" escalated when the US Government arrested 18 Japanese employees from Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric in a sting operation, charging them with stealing technical secrets from [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This case created significant friction between the US and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

Ultimately, Fujitsu settled, paying a one-time lump sum and annual licensing fees as high as $60 million, and agreed to respect [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s IP rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. These fees seriously threatened the competitiveness of Japanese computer makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. In response, MITI proposed to amend copyright laws to limit software protection to 15 years, significantly less than the international standard of 50 years, though this failed to take hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## The Japanese Software Crisis and Programmer Shortage

The Japanese government acknowledged a severe "software crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, realizing that without domestic alternatives, Japanese tech providers would remain dependent on software imports from companies like [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] or Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

A major obstacle was a persistent shortage of qualified programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, attributable to several factors:
*   **Education:** Japanese universities lacked enough qualified computer science teachers, and professors often lagged in adopting the latest computing trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. A lack of English bilingual abilities and overseas experience contributed to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Job Attractiveness:** Software engineering was not seen as an appealing job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The largest employers were software development arms of larger business families operating on a lifetime employment system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Developers lacked career progression, received poor pay, and performed unfulfilling work, mostly customization or maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. In 2010, an Infosys CEO estimated that 80% of Japan's software spending went to maintaining existing systems, compared to no more than 60% in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. These points highlight [[cultural_and_economic_factors_affecting_japans_software_development | cultural and economic factors affecting Japan's software development]].
*   **Lack of Startups:** Unlike the United States, which saw the rise of independent software giants like Adobe, Intuit, Synopsys, Cadence, Lotus, Electronic Arts, Microsoft, and Oracle in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, such companies failed to emerge in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This was attributed to a lack of customer acceptance, insufficient venture capital, an unwieldy lifetime employment system, and a [[cultural_and_economic_factors_affecting_japans_software_development | cultural lack of initiative/risk-taking]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. These were significant [[the_challenges_faced_by_japanese_software_startups | challenges faced by Japanese software startups]].

## BTRON and SIGMA & Unix

A lack of a common "software environment" or widely accepted operating system independent of hardware made Japanese engineers unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

*   **BTRON:** One proposed solution was TRON, a domestic OS project initiated in 1984 by Dr. Ken Sakamura <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. It aimed to create an "open" operating system to counter the dominance of Microsoft and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. The Business TRON (BTRON) variant was adopted by PC makers for use in Japanese schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. However, in April 1989, the US Trade Representative office listed BTRON as a potential Japanese trade barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Although the mention was later removed, the damage was done; Japanese microprocessor companies, already embroiled in US-Japan semiconductor disputes, withdrew, leading to BTRON's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **SIGMA & Unix:** In 1985, MITI launched the five-year Software Industrialized Generators and Maintenance Aids (SIGMA) project, funded with 25 billion yen, to improve programmer productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. The project developed standards and applications for networked Unix workstation computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. While SIGMA fell short of its ultimate goals, it did cause Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC to transition from [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] platforms to Unix, though they heavily customized it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. This gave them a "second wind" in mainframes and supercomputers, with Japan producing some of the world's fastest supercomputers in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

## The 1990s and Shifting Tides

The popping of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1990 led to a prolonged recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Customers could no longer afford expensive software modifications, causing a decline for Japanese mainframe makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. This crash also shook Japanese confidence, as the United States began to pull ahead based on its competitive advantages in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

MITI's traditional playbook of funding domestic champions to reverse-engineer products and mass-produce them cheaply, which worked well for industrial items like steel and automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, proved ineffective for software. Software success depends on widely held standards, networks of applications or users, and consumer familiarity, not just "replication economics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

### PC-98 & I-Mode

*   **PC-98:** The personal computer (PC) became a classic example of Japan's misstep in software-heavy consumer electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. For over a decade, NEC dominated the domestic PC market with its PC-98, a hardware-accelerated MS-DOS version supporting Japanese language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. However, in the early 1990s, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]], Microsoft, and Intel broke NEC's monopoly with a new DOS version supporting Japanese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This opened the Japanese market to foreign software and hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. The Japanese government and MITI decided to embrace a more globalized approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>, leading to the collapse of NEC's overpriced products and cementing Microsoft's dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. No domestic Japanese software maker has since credibly challenged the American giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.
*   **I-Mode:** A similar pattern emerged with NTT DoCoMo's mobile 2G web browser, I-mode, launched in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. It gained over 40 million subscribers by 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, and NTT sought to export it as a new revenue generator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. However, I-mode failed to gain traction abroad due to lack of adoption by handset partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>, and its window of opportunity closed with the release of the iPhone and its rich application ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite having a large software industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>, Japan's software landscape is predominantly dominated by custom-made packages with limited market potential or imported products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. While Japan's brightest spot in software is arguably gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>, its continued lag in the global software industry remains a persistent issue across technological eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

Recently, there has been significant discussion about SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation), China's national champion in semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. TechInsights and SemiAnalysis reported that SMIC has begun producing chips using their own seven-nanometer process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## SMIC's N+2 Node: A 7nm Leap Forward

The term "seven nanometers" in process nodes is primarily a marketing device, conveying improvements in power, performance, or area, rather than corresponding to a physical dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. It indicates that chips are approximately 70% better than the previous 10-nanometer generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

SMIC's N+2 node is an evolution of their N+1 process, which was first taped out in October 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Both N+1 and N+2 utilize DUV (Deep Ultraviolet) immersion lithography with multi-patterning, a method used by many foundries before EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) technology became prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Although SMIC's N+2 is capable of using EUV, the United States has imposed an export ban on this technology, preventing SMIC from acquiring such devices from ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

SemiAnalysis, via TechInsights, indicates that N+2 is "99% the same" as TSMC's N7 node, meaning their physical measurements, including finFETs (fin-shaped transistors) and their placements, are similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. TSMC began shipping N7 chips in high volume in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This places SMIC approximately four to six years behind the leading edge in high-volume production for an N7 equivalent node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Economic Competitiveness and Manufacturing Limitations

While N+2 represents one of the most [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | advanced processes]] available from any foundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, its economic competitiveness without EUV is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. It is technically possible to fabricate chips at nodes even more advanced than N7 using 193-nanometer immersion technology and multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Dr. Burn Lin, the "father" of 193-nanometer immersion lithography, noted in January 2022 that SMIC could even produce N5 equivalent chips with only multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

However, the challenge lies in achieving meaningful yields (chips that are usable and perform to specification) in high quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Samsung has developed [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | advanced process nodes]] but struggled with yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, and Intel famously faced difficulties transitioning from their 10-nanometer to 7-nanometer equivalent nodes without EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Given N+2's similarity to TSMC's N7, which ramped up without significant issues, SMIC's N+2 is likely to follow a similar yield optimization curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

The market has become more competitive since 2018, with foundries using EUV having economic advantages over those relying solely on DUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. An N7 equivalent node with only multi-patterning imposes significant design restrictions on chip designers, making it a functional but not ideal product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. In an open market, N+2 might not be economically viable due to TSMC's N6, an EUV-equipped evolution of N7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Domestic Focus and Trade Secret Concerns

SMIC may be anticipating N+2 to be primarily a China-only product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Its close resemblance to TSMC's N7 raises concerns about potential trade secret infringement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. TSMC successfully obtained product import bans on SMIC products made with their trade secrets in the US in 2002 and 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. If similar legal action were successful, it would limit N+2's viability as an export product, restricting its use to domestic Chinese products and exports to friendly countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

While SMIC values its export capabilities to countries like the United States, as highlighted in their earnings calls, they likely no longer solely depend on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## The Role of HiSilicon and Huawei

The Chinese chip design industry has matured significantly since the mid-2000s, becoming much more sophisticated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. HiSilicon, Huawei's chip design arm and once China's largest semiconductor company, is a prime candidate to utilize N+2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. They could use it to produce high-performing Chinese mobile processors for their popular phones and server chips for their cloud services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. HiSilicon was a flagship customer of TSMC, fabricating chips like the Kirin 980, 985, and 990 series on N7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

SMIC partnering with HiSilicon and Huawei would bring serious volume, which is crucial for foundries to scale and yield-optimize their process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. If these volumes are achieved, N+2 is expected to improve over time, similar to how TSMC mastered N7 before EUV arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Factors Driving [[developments_in_chinas_domestic_semiconductor_ecosystem | Developments in China's Domestic Semiconductor Ecosystem]]

China has prioritized leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing as a high policy goal since the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. A key figure in this push is Liang Bong Song, SMIC's Co-CEO and a TSMC alumnus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Known for his technical brilliance and relentless pursuit of the leading edge, Liang joined SMIC in 2017 from Samsung, bringing his 200-person R&D team and reorienting the company from a "boring Second Source manufacturer" to a "Leading Edge monster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. As long as Liang remains at SMIC, the company is expected to continue its push towards the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## External Challenges: Export Bans

Access to the latest lithography technologies is vital for SMIC's long-term progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. News has emerged about the United States government pressuring the Netherlands' ASML and Japan's Nikon to prevent the export of their immersion DUV lithography machines to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The timing of this push, coinciding with the N+2 shipment, is likely not coincidental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

The US has long blocked the export of the newest, most [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | advanced EUV machines]] to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Expanding this block to immersion lithography represents another significant step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Immersion machines, which use water and other fluids to improve the resolution of older 193-nanometer ARF (Argon Fluoride) laser technology (referred to as "dry"), are workhorses of modern semiconductor manufacturing and are quite mature, with prototypes entering the market in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. ASML and Nikon are the only two suppliers in this market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

Converting dry 193-nanometer ARF machines into immersion lithography machines can be done relatively quickly (less than five years) but requires substantial technical effort and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:10:00]</a>. The Western semiconductor industry transitioned from dry to first-generation immersion lithography in about two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. An N7 equivalent node, however, demands more sophisticated immersion technologies, which adds to the timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

As of this writing, Japan and the Netherlands have not yet decided on any ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. The Chinese government has responded with accusations of unfairness, asserting that such bans undermine free markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. It's noted that governments commonly protect nationally important industries, such as Europe protecting automobiles, China protecting telecom and internet, and America protecting computing technology since the Cold War era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

An export ban on 193-nanometer immersion lithography technology, without a corresponding ban on dry ARF technology (which seems unfeasible), would likely add four to six years to SMIC's progress towards the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Such a ban is also likely to stimulate significant investment in Chinese-made lithography equipment, focusing first on maintaining existing immersion equipment and second on facilitating the dry-to-immersion transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Whether Chinese companies can ultimately ship a complete system on par with ASML or Nikon is debatable, with the gap currently estimated at several years, though not insurmountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

## Significance and Future Outlook

Achieving a legitimate seven-nanometer node at high volume and good yield is a significant triumph for [[developments_in_chinas_domestic_semiconductor_ecosystem | China's advanced manufacturing industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Only three other companies have reached this level of scale and sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

From an American perspective, any successful immersion ban would not be a permanently damaging blow to China; it would primarily serve to maintain and slightly expand the Sino-American semiconductor gap for a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This strategy mirrors the American response to the Japanese semiconductor challenge over three decades ago, where government intervention bought time for the industry to build new markets, improve manufacturing weaknesses, and adopt innovative suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. The American semiconductor industry is encouraged to apply similar strategies today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

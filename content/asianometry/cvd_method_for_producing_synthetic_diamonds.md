The Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) method offers a way to grow diamonds in a low-pressure environment, reducing the need for expensive high-pressure equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Early Experiments

From 1952 to 1953, researcher William Eversol of the Union Carbide company conducted experiments in which he heated carbon-containing gas in the presence of a seed diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The carbon atoms in the air would attach to the diamond surface, adding to its mass without requiring high pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. This procedure, known as [[engineering_and_manufacturing_of_silicon_wafers | chemical vapor deposition]], is widely used in the [[engineering_and_manufacturing_of_silicon_wafers | semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Despite Eversol's work, it was largely forgotten as the industry initially favored the high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

## Key Breakthroughs and Refinements

### Atomic Hydrogen in Cleaning
In 1963, Dr. John Angus of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, formed a team to replicate and continue Eversol's research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. The critical factor for successfully growing pure, gem-quality diamonds with CVD was the use of atomic hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

During the CVD process, not all carbon attaches to the diamond surface as diamond; a significant portion forms as graphite, an impurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Initially, Angus's team used alternating growth and cleaning cycles, etching off the unwanted graphite with sulfuric acidâ€”a method reminiscent of [[engineering_and_manufacturing_of_silicon_wafers | semiconductor]] manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. A PhD student suggested using an atomic hydrogen stream from a tungsten filament for the cleaning step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. This greatly improved performance and allowed both growth and cleaning to occur in the same chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

### Atomic Hydrogen in Growth
In 1971, Angus presented his work at an academic meeting in the Soviet Union, mentioning his use of atomic hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. A Soviet team, intrigued, pioneered a second breakthrough: using atomic hydrogen not only during the cleaning phase but also during the growth phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This technique not only suppressed graphite formation but also converted any graphite that did form into gas, carrying it away from the diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Accelerated Growth in Japan
The Soviet findings attracted the attention of a team at Japan's National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Throughout the 1980s, this team utilized a hot filament or microwaves to activate a mix of hydrogen and methane, accelerating growth to a few micrometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

## Impact on the Diamond Market

One by one, the CVD industry overcame its limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. By the 1990s, the industry became capable of making single-crystal [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds | synthetic diamonds]] in various colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. These gem-quality synthetics soon began appearing in the jewelry market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

[[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] initially responded by investing in new methods to detect [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds | synthetic diamonds]], including UV fluorescence, X-rays, and advanced spectroscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. However, [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds | synthetic diamonds]] rapidly eliminated this weakness, reaching a point where they can only be identified in a lab with very advanced tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

This technological advancement occurred as [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] and the diamond industry underwent massive changes in the 1990s, including the fall of the Soviet Union and new discoveries in Australia that broke apart the old cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. In 2020, [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] announced it would start producing and selling its own [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds | synthetics]], seemingly an attempt to leverage and benefit from the [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds | synthetic diamond]] industry's technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

The rise of [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds | synthetic diamonds]] in the market is compared to cultured pearls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Just as cultured pearls, pioneered in Japan in the 1910s, became preferred by consumers for their consistent quality and environmental benefits, modern gem-quality CVD [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds | synthetic diamonds]] are seen as a superior product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. They are more beautiful, ideal-looking, better for the environment, involve less worker exploitation, and are produced far cheaper than natural diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. This development is "breaking" the diamond market, shifting value from the scarcity of the stone to the scarcity of luxury brands like [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, which include Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman, are among the most water-stressed nations globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This region has faced water scarcity for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. As a solution to these persistent challenges, these countries increasingly rely on [[desalination_in_the_gulf | desalination]] to produce renewable freshwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Water Scarcity in the Gulf

Several factors contribute to the severe water scarcity in the GCC:
*   **Limited Renewable Freshwater**: Kuwait, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar possess less than 100 cubic meters of renewable freshwater per person, significantly lower than an average household of four, which uses about 136 cubic meters annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Surface Water Contamination**: The limited surface water available is often not potable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. For example, Saudi Arabia's largest surface lake, Al-Asfar, is largely fed by agricultural runoff and is contaminated with heavy metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Groundwater Overextraction**: [[groundwater_overextraction_and_its_consequences_in_iran | Groundwater exploitation]] in GCC countries is intense, leading to negative social consequences like land subsidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Only about 10% of extracted groundwater is recharged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Rapid Population Growth**: The population of these countries more than doubled from 26.2 million in 1995 to 56.4 million in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The GCC is also one of the most urbanized regions, with 85% of the population residing in urban areas, a figure expected to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **High Agricultural Demand**: Water demand is increasing, particularly from agriculture. Farming of cereals, vegetables, fruits, and fodder for animals consumes up to 85% of the GCC's water resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. National security concerns related to food self-sufficiency make it difficult to reduce this demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Desalination as a Solution

Given these challenges, GCC countries view [[desalination_in_the_gulf | desalination]] as the primary method to secure sufficient renewable freshwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Historical Context of Desalination in the Gulf
The city of Jeddah in Saudi Arabia, a densely packed gateway to Mecca, receives less than 10 centimeters of rain annually but borders the salty Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Jeddah purchased its first desalination machine from the United Kingdom in 1907, known locally as the "Kendassa," which evaporated and re-condensed seawater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The global upsurge in desalination capacity in the 1920s and 1930s was driven by the booming oil industry, with World War II further advancing the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. After the war, Middle Eastern nations, including the GCC, were early adopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Kuwait installed the first modern distillation plant by Westinghouse in 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

In 1966, Saudi Arabia established a Water Desalination office, which later became the Saline Water Conversion Corporation and is now the Saudi Water Authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This entity alone is responsible for 22% of the world's desalination capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Desalinated water capacity in the Middle East and North Africa, including the GCC, rapidly increased from the mid-1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Today, Saudi Arabia and the UAE produce the majority of desalinated water among GCC countries, with Saudi Arabia producing 2.9 million cubic meters and the UAE 2.2 million in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Desalination Technologies

There are two main categories of desalination: thermal and membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Thermal Multi-Stage Flash (MSF)
Most mega-sized water facilities in the Gulf operate using thermal-based methods, primarily Multi-Stage Flash (MSF), which emerged in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. MSF plants evaporate seawater by simultaneously raising temperature and lowering pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. They consist of multiple modular stages, each with a low-pressure flash chamber and a condenser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Heat recovery and reuse in MSF plants can improve efficiency by 30-35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. The largest MSF plants can have up to 40 stages and evaporate 85% of incoming water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

#### Challenges: Salt Scaling
The primary concern with MSF plants is "salt scaling" or "scale deposits," where calcium and magnesium salts precipitate on heat exchanger tubes, reducing heat transfer efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Operators prevent this by:
*   Maintaining a top brine temperature of 90-120 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   Pre-treating seawater with a de-carbonation step to remove dissolved carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   Adding scale inhibitor chemicals like phosphates to the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   Performing limited washing using sponge balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

#### Advantages of MSF
*   **Simplicity and Capacity**: MSF plants are simple, with few moving parts beyond conventional water pumps, allowing them to process vast amounts of seawater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Robustness and Reliability**: Few connecting pipes minimize leaks and corrosion, making MSF plants robust and reliable; many have exceeded their 20-year design lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   **Modularity**: Stages are modular, allowing for easy adjustment of desalination capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Minimal Pre-treatment**: MSF plants can process poor-quality seawater with minimal pre-treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

#### Disadvantages of MSF
*   **High Energy Consumption**: MSF is extremely energy-intensive, requiring 10 to 25 kilowatt-hours or more to produce one cubic meter of desalted water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Energy Reserves**: While pairing with existing power stations can cut energy consumption by 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, the energy requirements remain daunting. In 2014, Saudi Arabia's cogeneration plants consumed 1.5 million barrels of oil daily, 15% of its oil production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Without the GCC countries' large energy reserves and subsidies, these plants would likely not be economical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### Reverse Osmosis (SWRO)
Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) is the dominant membrane-based desalination method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. It uses pressure to push salty water through a semi-permeable filter, retaining salt and producing clean water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

#### Advantages of SWRO
*   **Energy Efficiency**: SWRO does not require heating the water, making it far less energy-intensive, consuming about 4 to 5 kilowatt-hours per cubic meter of waterâ€”a third or quarter of MSF's energy use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Global Preference**: Energy is the most significant cost factor in desalination, leading most countries outside the GCC to favor RO processes since 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. RO holds over 60% of the world's installed desalination capacity, while MSF has less than 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Flexibility**: SWRO can be connected to cheap renewable energy sources like solar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Decentralization**: The smaller economic size threshold for SWRO systems encourages more localized water sources, reducing the need for expensive pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

#### Disadvantages of SWRO
*   **Extensive Pre-treatment**: Large-scale RO operations require careful pre-treatment of seawater to prevent fouling of membranes by silt, algae, jellyfish, salts, and decomposed organic matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This pre-treatment can add up to 25% to the final cost of desalted water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

#### SWRO in the GCC
Bahrain has the highest usage rate of reverse osmosis among GCC countries due to its more brackish source water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Saudi Arabia built its first RO plant in Jeddah in 1978 as a demonstration unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. While MSF methods continue to dominate due to existing investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, mounting cost and [[environmental_concerns_of_desalination | environmental pressures]] are leading GCC countries like Saudi Arabia to explore more RO-only and hybrid RO-thermal systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. In 2022, the Saudi Water and Electricity Company commissioned Shuqaiq 3, one of their first large reverse osmosis plants on the Red Sea, with a capacity of 450,000 cubic meters per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Recent privatization moves in Saudi Arabia's freshwater supply industry are expected to continue this trend towards more sustainable desalination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

## Brine Disposal: A Major Environmental Concern
Both thermal and membrane desalination processes produce brine as a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. For every two cubic meters of freshwater, one cubic meter of brine is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. This brine is typically very hot and 40-80% saltier than seawater, often containing heavy metals, acids, chlorine, and anti-scalant chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

Brine disposal is challenging and is a significant cost factor, adding 5-30% to the final cost of freshwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Options are limited:
*   Burying it underground can contaminate groundwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   Dumping it at the shoreline or deep underwater harms local ecosystems, even with dilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
*   Extracting and selling salt from brine is not yet economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

The [[environmental_concerns_of_desalination | environmental issues associated with desalination]], particularly brine management, will worsen as the GCC's water demands grow and more mega-fabs are built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Conclusion and Future Outlook
Despite the environmental and economic challenges, desalination is essential for GCC countries, which often use 8 to 30 times more freshwater than they naturally possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. However, the intense centralization of water systems, with 50% of Saudi Arabia's capacity in five plants and 60% of the UAE's in four, poses economical, environmental, and national security risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. A technology transition from MSF to SWRO can encourage decentralization, bringing water supplies closer to consumption points, which is beneficial for communities, nations, and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

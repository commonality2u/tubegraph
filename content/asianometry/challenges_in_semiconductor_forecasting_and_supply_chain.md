The [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics | semiconductor industry]] is characterized by extreme volatility, with booms rapidly following busts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Even in normal times, conditions are unpredictable, with shipments capable of soaring 70% in one year and crashing 40% the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The current period is marked by a significant chip shortage, leading to questions about how soon this might turn into a glut given the widespread efforts to build or expand fabrication plants (fabs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Dynamics of Demand and Supply

Effective planning is crucial for forecasting capacity and avoiding shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. While large customers often have precautionary planning, limiting the impact of shortages on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, accurate forecasting remains a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Forecasting Difficulties

End-users do not directly purchase microchips in large quantities; instead, chips are bought by vendors who integrate them into consumer goods like PCs and smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. These chips have a short "shelf life" due to the rapid introduction of new products that quickly render existing iterations obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Missing an annual product launch cycle, as AMD experienced in the mid-2000s, can have severe consequences for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Consequently, foundry customers consistently demand rapid production and shipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Double Booking and External Factors

A common issue leading to perceived shortages is "double booking" orders by customers seeking to secure stock during uncertain times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. TSMC Chairman Mark Liu identified double booking as a primary reason the recent shortage was not as severe as it appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. He attributed this behavior to legitimate reasons such as the [[impact_of_the_pandemic_on_semiconductor_supply_chains | pandemic]] and ongoing China-America trade tensions, with the latter being a more enduring concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Macroeconomic Influence on Demand

Demand for semiconductors is heavily influenced by the [[impact_of_macroeconomy_on_semiconductor_demand | broader macro-economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. As consumer items, electronics sales decline when economic conditions are difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Historically, downturns in the semiconductor business cycle have been linked to oil shocks in 1975, 1982, and 1991, as well as the Asian Financial Crisis of 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. For instance, in March 2020, experts predicted a global economic collapse, leading companies to cut expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. However, stimulus packages rapidly revived the economy by Q3 2020, a turnaround few anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## The Role of Over-supply in Down Cycles

Research from 2005 suggests that semiconductor down cycles are more significantly triggered by surges in semiconductor inventory levels and fab capacity—an over-supply—rather than a decrease in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Economics of Fab Operation

Building a fab is extremely costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. While Moore's Law describes the doubling of transistors on an integrated circuit every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, Moore's Second Law, or Rock's Law, observes that the cost of semiconductor tools doubles every four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. These tools constitute 75% of a fab's total cost, driving expenses upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. For example:
*   A leading-edge fab cost $1 billion in 2000, double its 1995 cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   By 2005, it was $3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   In 2020, TSMC's N5 fab cost around $17 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, with its N3 process fab estimated at $19.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

These substantial fixed costs mean that foundries must put up billions before even competing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The marginal cost of producing an additional chip is nearly zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, incentivizing foundries to manufacture and sell as many chips as possible to amortize these fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Market Share and Industry Cycles

When supply floods the market and exceeds demand, prices collapse, reducing profitability for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Despite this, foundries are incentivized to sell every possible chip, even if it only generates a small gross profit, to contribute to their survival costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Industry leaders like TSMC and Samsung prioritize market share over profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. They avoid mothballing capacity to prevent competitors from gaining market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Their massive economies of scale allow them to drive market prices down to their survival price, which is significantly lower than that of other industry players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

This results in a fierce downcycle that eliminates lower-performing companies through bankruptcies and buyouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Supply eventually re-balances with demand, and the cycle resets, awaiting the next chip shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Government Subsidies and Their Impact

Globally, governments are proposing and implementing subsidies to encourage fab construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Examples include:
*   China's $20 billion semiconductor plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   President Joe Biden's $50 billion inclusion in his stimulus plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   The EU's plan for 145 billion euro for a 2-nm cutting-edge fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

In the US, the proposed CHIPS Act and American Foundries Act aim to establish an R&D fund and a 20-40% tax credit for semiconductor production equipment acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The tax credit's effects are expected to be short-term, impacting one fab generation (three to five years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, while the R&D fund is seen as having longer-term effects, particularly in fostering public-private partnerships like the one that created EUV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

While government involvement in high-priority sectors and national sovereignty are acknowledged, concerns exist that subsidies create market distortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The intent of subsidies is to attract manufacturing, and a 40% subsidy can achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. However, for sustainability, subsidized fabs must eventually operate independently unless subsidies continue indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Future renewals of such credits may face greater scrutiny once current shortages are resolved and public attention shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Current Global Fab Build-out

The world is currently witnessing a significant build-out of new fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>:
*   TSMC is constructing its Arizona fab, with whispers of an upscale in its planned size from 20,000 wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   Samsung is negotiating a multi-billion dollar investment to expand its Austin fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   Second-tier foundries are also expanding or upgrading capacity, with numerous press releases from companies not operating below 10nm process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   GlobalFoundries is investing $1.4 billion in expansion and moving up its IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   SMIC is receiving $2.35 billion from the Shenzhen government for a project expected to produce 40,000 wafers a month by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

This collective investment represents a massive increase in capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. For example, TSMC's Arizona fab alone could produce 25,000 to 100,000 wafer starts per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Combined with other expansions, hundreds of thousands of wafers are expected to enter the market within the next one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. It is unlikely that demand for tens of millions of chips, driven by factors like increased remote work during the [[impact_of_the_pandemic_on_semiconductor_supply_chains | pandemic]], will persist as people return to offices and schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Government purchases, such as the Department of Defense's 1.9 billion semiconductors per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, would not be sufficient to absorb this projected output; TSMC's Arizona fab alone could theoretically produce 3.5 billion dies in one month at 50,000 wafers per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. This significant capacity expansion leads to the question of when the current boom will inevitably transition into a bust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

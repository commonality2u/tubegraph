The semiconductor industry has undergone major transitions over its history, offering opportunities for certain companies to pull ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. One such transition was the shift to copper and Low-K interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Interconnects are essential wires that transmit electrical signals between transistors on an integrated circuit (IC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. For over 30 years, these interconnects were made from aluminium and silicon dioxide, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. However, by the late 1990s, new materials became technically necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## The Challenge of RC Delay

The need for new materials arose primarily from an issue called RC delay, which stands for resistance-capacitance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Resistance:** All wires have resistance, impeding the flow of electrons and degrading the signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Thicker, shorter, and wider wires have less resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Capacitance:** Wires in an IC are physically close and separated by insulating dielectric layers, causing the setup to store charge like a capacitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This unwanted capacitance slows down signal transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

RC delay is the extra time an electric signal takes to travel through an interconnect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. As chips became denser and transistors smaller, more interconnects were needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Shrinking interconnects increased resistance and unwanted capacitance, leading to more RC delay and slower chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. While initially insignificant, RC delay became a major contributor to chip speed by the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. By the 100-nanometer process node, transmitting a signal through a 1-millimeter interconnect would take six times longer than through an equivalent-sized transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

The solution was to replace the interconnect system's materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>:
1.  **Copper for Interconnects:** Replacing aluminium with copper was an obvious choice, as copper lines have 35% less resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
2.  **Low-K Dielectric for Insulation:** Changing the insulating dielectric layer from silicon dioxide (k-value 3.9) to a "Low-K" material (lower k-value) would cut unwanted capacitance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

Together, copper and Low-K solutions could potentially cut RC delay by a factor of four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## IBM's Pioneering Role

In September 1997, IBM announced they had successfully produced copper interconnects, shocking the semiconductor world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Their "red aluminium" project had been underway for 15 years, with engineers working intensely in secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This achievement was capped by a famous image of six layers of copper interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. IBM intended to mass-produce copper-wired wafers by early 1998, with the first chips for Apple Computer's Power Macs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

IBM's announcement was significant because copper presented serious manufacturing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>:
*   **Copper Poisoning:** Copper atoms can diffuse into silicon or silicon dioxide, hurting chip performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. A "diffusion barrier" (often made from tantalum) is needed to block copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Inability to Etch:** Copper cannot be etched like aluminium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

### The Damascene Method

To overcome the etching problem, IBM reversed the traditional manufacturing sequence with the "damascene method" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Instead of etching a metal layer, they first etch trenches and vias into the dielectric layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Then, they apply the diffusion barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>, fill the trenches with copper using electroplating, sand off excess copper, and apply a capping layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. This complex process was named after Damascus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

Key technological advancements led to IBM's breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>:
*   Discovery of tantalum and tantalum nitride as diffusion barriers (late 1980s-early 1990s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   Invention of the damascene method (around 1985) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   Development of "super-filling" or "bottoms-up growth" using electroplating to fill trenches without defects (1989) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

In 1993, an IBM team produced multi-level copper wires using this combination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. However, this first method was not economically viable due to throughput and yield issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. Another IBM team, led by Dan Edelstein, re-engineered the process to include a "dual damascene" methodology, producing trenches and vias simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This new recipe passed internal requirements in 1995, leading to the public announcement two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

Implementing copper in the fab was also challenging, requiring isolation of copper tools to prevent "copper poisoning" of the rest of the fab and new waste disposal technologies for copper in water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

## Industry Catch-up and Intel's Approach

Despite initial claims that IBM was 1-3 years ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>, Motorola announced their own copper interconnects just two weeks later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. While IBM was initially alone in copper research, the industry realized aluminium's deficiencies after 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. Companies like Motorola (starting 1990, partly through their PowerPC alliance with IBM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>, [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | AMD]] (1995), and AT&T (around the same time) began their own copper work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

Surprisingly, [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | Intel]] did not start its copper interconnect program until 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>, despite their own researchers publishing on copper electroplating in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. Much of the rapid catch-up in the industry was facilitated by public-private R&D consortiums like Sematech, which directed funds to universities and released findings into the public domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. This allowed the rest of the semiconductor industry to rapidly catch up, even as IBM tried to keep certain details secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

## The 180 Nanometer Node Transition

The 180-nanometer node, scheduled for high volume in 1999, was a major technical transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. It involved:
*   Copper interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.
*   A 30% reduction in feature size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
*   New 193-nanometer DUV excimer laser lithography tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.
*   The planned transition to 300-millimeter wafers was pushed back to the 130-nanometer node due to the complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

IBM kicked off the 180-nanometer generation in 1998 with the PowerPC 750CX, whose copper interconnects sped up chips from 300 to 400 Megahertz, putting IBM in the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. Motorola followed closely with a 220-nanometer node in late 1998, producing PowerPC G4 chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

Notably, [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | Intel]]'s 180-nanometer process did not use copper interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. This was due to their late start on copper and the need for a rapidly scalable process for their massive PC CPU production, which faced a limited supply of copper tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | Intel]] would only implement copper interconnects in November 2000, with the 130-nanometer node, even then using it for only six out of seven layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

## The Low-K Problem

While copper addressed increasing wire resistance, the semiconductor industry struggled to find a suitable Low-K dielectric material for cutting unwanted capacitance that fit well into the process flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

*   **250 nm node:** Fluorinated Silicon Glass (FSG) was used, with a K-value of 3.5, slightly lower than silicon dioxide (3.9) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:37">[00:27:37]</a>.
*   **180 nm node:** Hydrogen Silsesquioxane (HSQ) with a lower K-value of 2.8 was attempted using a "spin-on" technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. However, HSQ failed to scale in high-volume production due to distortion under high temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. [[Impact on TSMC and Samsung | TSMC]] and Texas Instruments experienced significant setbacks with this failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

## [[Impact on TSMC and Samsung | TSMC]]'s and UMC's Different Paths

Across the Pacific, Taiwanese foundries [[Impact on TSMC and Samsung | TSMC]] and UMC faced the challenge of adopting copper with very little prior experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. [[Impact on TSMC and Samsung | TSMC]] had struggled with its 250-nanometer process, allowing UMC to rapidly catch up in market share and capacity by 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.

For the 180-nanometer node, [[Impact on TSMC and Samsung | TSMC]] and UMC opted for different paths to learn copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>:
*   UMC joined an IBM-sponsored research consortium (likely the Semiconductor Research Corporation) to benefit from IBM's patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>.
*   [[Impact on TSMC and Samsung | TSMC]] decided to go it alone, with a team of six elite semiconductor scientists, known as "the Six R&D Horsemen," leading a crash effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.

Both methods showed some success. By 1999, both UMC and [[Impact on TSMC and Samsung | TSMC]] were shipping 180-nanometer chips with the top two metal layers made with copper, though lagging behind IBM's more extensive copper integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>.

## The Legendary 130 Nanometer Node

The 130-nanometer node (following [[Impact on TSMC and Samsung | TSMC]]'s minor 150nm node) was expected to complete the copper interconnect transition and introduce a "true" Low-K dielectric material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>. The industry split on the Low-K material choice:

*   **SiLK (Dow Chemical):** IBM, UMC, and Infineon chose SiLK, a proprietary material with a K-value of 2.6 (or possibly 2.2), applied with the spin-on technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>.
*   **Black Diamond (Applied Materials):** Texas Instruments and [[Impact on TSMC and Samsung | TSMC]] favored Black Diamond, with a K-value of 2.8, which was exclusive to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. [[Impact on TSMC and Samsung | TSMC]]'s Dr. Chiang personally swore off the spin-on technique after the HSQ failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | Intel]] stuck with the older FSG technique due to their large capacity needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>.

The SiLK + spin-on setup ultimately failed, with neither IBM nor UMC's customers able to ship products using it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. This was a costly technical and financial decision for UMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, who defected from IBM in October 2001 and switched to a CVD process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. IBM eventually switched to CVD as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>.

In October 2001, [[Impact on TSMC and Samsung | TSMC]] became the first to ship 130-nanometer chips with both copper interconnects and Low-K dielectric, offering an alternate FSG version for customers like Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a>. Yields for products like Nvidia's NV30 started low but reached 70% and higher by late 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[Impact on TSMC and Samsung | TSMC]]'s monumental 130-nanometer node set the Taiwanese giant apart from its competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. Their R&D team, the "Six R&D Horsemen," received the 2003 Outstanding Scientific and Technological Worker Award from the Taiwanese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. This achievement transformed [[Impact on TSMC and Samsung | TSMC]]'s perception from a simple factory to a formidable force in R&D and innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. IBM Micro's inability to capitalize on its initial groundbreaking copper breakthrough due to the SiLK decision ultimately cost it, marking a disappointing close to a promising start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>.

The Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant experienced a severe accident in March 2011, following the Great East Japan Earthquake and subsequent massive tsunami <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The tsunami disabled the plant's cooling systems, leading to nuclear fuel meltdown and several hydrogen explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. In response, Tepco, the plant's owner, and the Japanese government have committed billions of dollars to its safe and efficient [[decommissioning_process_of_fukushima | decommissioning process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Plant Unit Damage Overview

The Fukushima Daiichi plant has six units in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Units 4, 5, and 6:** These units were not operating when the accident occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   Units 5 and 6 suffered minor tsunami damage and remained largely fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   Unit 4 sustained damage from the tsunami and a hydrogen explosion due to exhaust spillover from Unit 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. However, because its reactor was shut down, the fuel rods suffered little damage, resulting in tolerable radiation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Units 1, 2, and 3:** These units were in operation when the tsunami hit and suffered the worst damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. All three experienced meltdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Units 1 and 3 also had hydrogen explosions that released radioactive materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## [[Robotics in nuclear disaster response | Robotics in Nuclear Disaster Response]]: Historical Context

The first nuclear response [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] were developed by the United States following the Three Mile Island accident in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Three Mile Island (1979):**
    *   The Surveillance and In-Service Inspection Robot, a crawler, was first deployed in August 1982 to take photographs, collect samples, and make radiation readings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
    *   Another robot named Fred, introduced a year later, was equipped with a high-pressure water spray for decontamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   Three remote reconnaissance vehicles were built to defuel the reactor core, which was flooded with radioactive water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. These [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] were small, tethered, and used familiar technologies for flushing, scraping, and cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Chernobyl (1986):**
    *   The Soviet Union initially relied on hundreds of thousands of human "biorobots" for cleanup due to extremely high radiation levels and bureaucratic issues that denied the use of helicopters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   Eventually, [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] were brought in, notably the Specialized Transport Robot (STR-1), a wirelessly controlled bulldozer adapted from an unmanned lunar vehicle, for debris removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Initial [[Robotics in nuclear disaster response | Robotics]] Response at Fukushima

The first [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robot]] arrived at Fukushima in April 2011, three weeks after the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **American [[Robotics in nuclear disaster response | Robots]]:**
    *   Four PakBot military multipurpose [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] from iRobot Corporation USA were deployed to enter the damaged and irradiated Unit 1, 2, and 3 reactor buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. PakBot, weighing about 30 kg and resembling extension arms on treads, had previously been used in Iraq and Afghanistan for detecting and diffusing improvised explosive devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. After training, they entered Unit 2, measuring radiation, temperature, and oxygen concentration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
    *   A larger iRobot called Warrior was later used for cleaning, vacuuming, and clearing obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Other cleaner [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] included Bobcat and the Swedish-built Brokk 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
    *   The T-Hawk, a small unmanned aerial vehicle from Honeywell, flew over units 1 through 4 from April to July 2011 to assess the situation and collect dust samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Japanese [[Robotics in nuclear disaster response | Robotics]] Challenges:**
    *   The reliance on American [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] sparked mild controversy, given Japan's reputation in [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robotics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
    *   After a criticality accident in 1999, Japan's technology centers had developed nuclear disaster [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]], including the Remote Surveillance Squad (Rescue robots) by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, these [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] received minimal upgrades after 2001 due to budget issues, and by 2011, many critical components were out of stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Worse, there were no trained operators, as the original engineer had left the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
    *   JAEA re-engineered the Rescue robot into the JAEA-3, grafting parts from Brokk, which started its missions in September 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   PakBot's limitations, such as restricted radio communication range and inability to easily traverse stairs, led Tepco to seek a new solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. They turned to the Kinsei series of search and rescue [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] developed by the Neito project at the Chiba Institute of Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Kinsei, initially designed for difficult terrain and underground malls, was modified to be radiation-hardened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Radiation Hardening in [[Robotics in nuclear disaster response | Robots]]

Nuclear accidents release various forms of radiation, including alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, X-rays, and neutron particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Radiation interaction with semiconductor materials can cause:
1.  **Displacement Effect:** Particles like neutrons and alpha particles collide with semiconductors, displacing atoms and altering structural arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This leads to issues like higher current leakage and decreased device lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
2.  **Ionization Effect:** Electrons, protons, and X-rays pass through semiconductors, creating electron-hole pairs, which can cause permanent glitches and erratic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

Damage can occur at device, circuit, and system levels, necessitating radiation hardening at all these levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Device Level:** Modifying transistor layouts, adding insulating substrates (e.g., silicon on insulator), or making devices larger (e.g., bigger gate sizes for higher current capacities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Circuit Level:** Duplicating critical circuits or adding monitoring circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. These are generally hardware-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **System Level:** Incorporating software benefits like preventive scrubbing algorithms, in addition to hardware additions like radiation armor and redundancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Gamma ray testing showed Kinsei's essential components (180 nm CPU, motherboard, motor driver boards) could survive a dose of about 200 Grays (20,000 rads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Given initial Fukushima measurements of about 100 Grays, Kinsei was estimated to work for over 100 hours with a 10% chance of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Modified Kinsei [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] entered the reactor buildings in June 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. After five successful missions, a broken communication link led to the abandonment of Kinsei 1 in October 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Kinsei 2 and 3 were redesigned to fix this flaw and deployed in February 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## [[Decommissioning process of Fukushima | Decommissioning Process]] and Continued [[Robotics in nuclear disaster response | Robotics]]

The Japanese government's next goals are to gradually [[decommissioning_process_of_fukushima | decommission]] the plant and rebuild the surrounding area, a multi-step process overseen by Tepco and the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning (IRID) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### Cleanup and Decontamination
Hydrogen explosions scattered rubble across the site, requiring removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Astaco-Sora:** Hitachi developed this heavy-duty [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robot]] to collect rubble into recycling bins using its two heavy-duty arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Cleaner [[Robotics in nuclear disaster response | Robots]]:** Raccoon and Arounder are smaller bots that spray down surfaces with high-pressure water or dry ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Meister is a heavy-duty [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robot]] that can drill for samples or vacuum particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

### Spent Fuel Removal
Each unit has a spent fuel assembly that needs to be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Unit 4:** In December 2014, Tepco announced the successful removal of 1,535 spent fuel rods from the damaged Unit 4 reactor pool, which were then placed in a cooling pool in Unit 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Unit 3:** Tepco began removing 566 spent fuel rods from Unit 3 in 2019, completing the process in February 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Units 1 and 2:** Removal of spent fuel rods from these units is scheduled to start in 2023 or later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### Nuclear Fuel Debris (Corium) Inspection and Removal
In Units 1-3, the nuclear fuel melted down, burning through its original location in the reactor pressure vessel and the concrete pedestal, eventually reaching the primary containment vessel (PCV) before being cooled and solidifying into corium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This corium must be inspected and removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. IRID uses different [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] for each reactor due to their unique circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

*   **Unit 1:**
    *   The PCV is flooded to a depth of 2 meters, likely with corium at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
    *   In 2012, Tepco punched a small hole in the PCV to run a wired camera and conduct water tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
    *   In 2014, IRID developed "P-morph," a morphing [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robot]] designed to squeeze through a 100 mm hole, then twist into a U-shape to navigate a lead plate for radiation shielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Early attempts faced obstacles, but improvements allowed mission completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
    *   The next step is to build a [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robot]] to collect the pebble-like nuclear fuel debris scattered inside the pedestal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Unit 2:**
    *   This unit suffered a meltdown but no hydrogen explosion, leaving its building structure intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
    *   Tepco developed the "Scorpion" [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robot]], which can crawl through a small hole and reconfigure itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Deployed in 2017, its left tread failed, and it was left inside the reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
    *   The inside of the reactor was eventually photographed entirely using a camera on what appeared to be a fishing rod, with multiple shots stitched into a panorama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Unit 3:**
    *   The PCV is almost entirely flooded to a depth of about 6 meters, necessitating new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. The Unit 2 entrance approach was not feasible due to flooding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
    *   A [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robot]] in 2015 reached only the first-floor grating outside the pedestal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
    *   It took two years to build a suitable [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robot]] for the 14 cm entrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. The "Mini-Manbo" (little sunfish), a tiny thing 13 cm across and 30 cm long, successfully recorded video of the nuclear debris in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

### Corium Removal Plans
With the nuclear fuel debris located, IRID and Tepco decided to begin collecting and removing it from Unit 2 first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This will involve a massive stainless steel robotic arm, sitting outside the PCV, reaching in to pick up debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. The project start was delayed to 2023 due to the need to improve the arm's capabilities and add attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. IRID anticipates it will take at least 10 years to remove all nuclear fuel debris from the Fukushima site, with more work needed for cleaning and decontamination thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

## Return of Residents
Despite the ongoing challenges, conditions have improved enough for the government to allow local residents to return home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. In April 2019, the evacuation order was lifted for Kuma, the town closest to the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. However, only a small percentage of residents have returned, indicating that significant work remains for both people and [[robotics_in_nuclear_disaster_response | robots]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

The defection of Liang Mong Song to Samsung was a pivotal event in the semiconductor industry, significantly impacting the competitive landscape between TSMC and Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Background at TSMC

Liang Mong Song, described as unquestionably brilliant but scathingly difficult to work with, was one of TSMC's founding geniuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. He rose through the company's ranks for nearly two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

After graduating from Taiwan's National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, Liang pursued graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, under Professor Hu Ten-ming, a future TSMC Chief Technology Officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Liang, a specialist in FinFET technology, played a critical role in TSMC's eventual transition to this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

He worked at AMD for over a decade, being named in over 180 critical semiconductor patents and publishing over 350 technical papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. In 1992, at age 40, Liang returned to Taiwan to join TSMC's R&D department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, part of a group of brilliant semiconductor minds returning from the United States, including Professor Hu, Chiang Chang Yi, Rick Tai, Douglas Yu, and Morris Chang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

One of TSMC's most significant technical achievements, the 2003 implementation of copper interconnects in their 130 nanometer process node, was led by a team of six elite R&D scientists, including Liang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. This development allowed TSMC to overtake IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>, and Liang received the 2003 Outstanding Scientific and Technological Worker Award alongside Chiang Chang Yi and H.J. Liu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. Liang is named on nearly 500 TSMC patents and is known for his obsessive dedication and incredible knowledge of advanced semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. He was handsomely rewarded, earning over $21 million USD in stock and cash compensation during his 17 years at TSMC, including over $1 million annually during the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

### Personality and Career Shift
Despite his brilliance, Liang's stubborn nature led to frequent clashes with colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. He was described as "very strict on technology, very rigorous," with no room for negotiation on requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. His future colleagues in China would find him inflexible, less enthusiastic in anything other than technology, and aloof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. He was likened to Lu Bu, a Chinese general known for his ferocity and betrayal of allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

In 2005, when Morris Chang retired as CEO, Rick Tai became his successor, leading to a shuffle in leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. Chiang Chang Yi, Senior R&D VP, retired, opening a spot for two new leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. Liang believed he was the best candidate for one of these positions, but the role went to Jack Sun, a rival with a broader view of TSMC's operations and better interpersonal skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

Liang was instead transferred to head a new initiative called "Beyond More" or "More than More," focusing on expanding TSMC's trailing-edge foundry capabilities into new verticals like MEMS, automotive sensors, and advanced packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. While this is a growing business for TSMC today, it was small at the time, starting with a four-person office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. Liang's passion was for the leading edge, and he viewed this new position as a "banishment to a far off province" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. His resentment grew, leading him to feel leadership had cast him aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

## The Defection

In February 2009, Liang resigned from TSMC after 17 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. His resignation agreement included a two-year non-compete clause, with a significant portion of his financial payout withheld until its fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. Liang initially stated he would spend this time caring for his parents and teaching at National Tsing Hua University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.

However, in October 2010, six months into his non-compete, he took a visiting scholar position at Sungkyunkwan University in Korea, teaching a simple class three hours a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. Sungkyunkwan University has a close association with the Korean *chaebol* Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>. Samsung Electronics, after dominating memory and display markets, was aiming to challenge TSMC in advanced foundries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.

Starting around Liang's departure from TSMC in 2009, Samsung rapidly closed the gap in process node technology, moving from 45 nanometers to 32 nanometers and then to 28 nanometers in just two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. As early as March 2010, TSMC employees questioned Liang about media reports of him working at Samsung, which he repeatedly denied, swearing he would never work there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.

On July 2011, two months after his non-compete expired, Liang officially joined Samsung as Executive Vice President of Samsung Foundry and Technical Director of Samsung LSI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. He brought with him a team of 10 to 20 TSMC engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>.

## Legal Battle and Impact

Four months after Liang joined Samsung, TSMC filed a lawsuit in Taiwan against him, alleging he had broken his non-compete agreement. This lawsuit spanned over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a>.

The timing of Liang's defection seemed to [[impact_on_tsmc_and_samsung | deeply affect TSMC's work]]. In 2009, TSMC was preparing its 28 nanometer node, but high-volume production slipped from 2010 to mid-2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. The 28 nm and 20 nm nodes represented the end of planar scaling, after which both companies needed to implement FinFET gate technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.

Upon Liang's arrival, Samsung was attempting to move to a 20 nanometer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. Liang, known for "taking it to the limit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>, stopped this, instead having Samsung jump directly from 28 nanometers to 14 nanometers, adopting FinFET simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. This "three-generation jump" was an incredibly rapid progression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.

Liang's efforts were seen as a "miracle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>. In 2015, Samsung announced they had successfully brought out a 14 nanometer process node ahead of TSMC's 16 nanometer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>. This stunning move broke TSMC's near-monopoly in advanced semiconductor foundries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>.

Having the first FinFET-based implementation allowed Samsung to lure significant customers from TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>. Qualcomm announced a multi-billion dollar deal for Samsung to produce their high-end mobile chips, a massive blow as Qualcomm had previously used TSMC for these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>. Even Apple, TSMC's most valuable customer (starting with the A8 chip in 2014) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>, decided to split production of the A9 chip for the iPhone 6s between TSMC and Samsung a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>. This was seen as a warning to TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>. In January 2015, Morris Chang publicly admitted TSMC was "a bit behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>.

### Legal Outcome and Aftermath
Liang initially prevailed in the first trial of the TSMC lawsuit, defended by lawyer Wellington Ku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>. However, TSMC appealed. In the second trial, the company presented evidence:
*   Liang's lectures at Sungkyunkwan were to Samsung employees and took place on Samsung's campus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>.
*   Technical analyses showed Samsung's 45nm, 32nm, and 28nm chips became "very technically close to TSMC's after 2009," differing from previous IBM-licensed technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>.
*   Liang used a Samsung email address as early as 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>.

Judge Shong Song-may, a Berkeley-educated judge with a Korean husband, ruled in favor of TSMC, a decision upheld by the Taiwan Supreme Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>. She mandated that Liang could not work for Samsung until after the end of 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>. The distraction of the court battle and the final decision likely had repercussions for Samsung's manufacturing progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>.

In 2015, Samsung encountered issues with their Apple A9 chips, which netizens reported reached higher temperatures and potentially had lower battery life than TSMC's counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>. Morris Chang, meanwhile, mobilized a massive R&D effort at TSMC to retake node leadership at the 10nm, 7nm, and 5nm process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>. Apple's next chip, the A10, became a TSMC exclusive, and has remained so ever since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>. As of the video's writing, TSMC remains the leading semiconductor foundry, with Samsung in second place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:00">[19:49:00]</a>. This period illustrates a clear [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | comparison of semiconductor manufacturing strategies between companies]].

### Subsequent Defection to SMIC
After his Samsung contract ended in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>, Liang, referred to as the "semiconductor Lu Bu," joined SMIC in mainland China with a massive team of 200 Taiwanese and South Korean engineers, recruited over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>. His reported salary was initially about $200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:00">[21:07:00]</a>. His arrival at SMIC caused tension, as he demanded a CEO role, leading to him and Tao Haijun being co-CEOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>. Liang focused on the leading edge, while Tao handled the legacy business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:27:00">[21:27:00]</a>. He pushed SMIC to jump multiple generations, achieving a 95% yield for 14nm and 12nm processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:14:00">[22:14:00]</a>, leading to a salary increase to $340,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:24:00">[22:24:00]</a>. His attempts to acquire an EUV machine for ASML were blocked by the US government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>. Despite internal debate, Liang continued to push for the 7nm node using older DUV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:44:00">[22:44:00]</a>. In 2018, Chiang returned to SMIC as Vice Chairman, making him Liang's manager again, which led to a dispute and Liang's attempt to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>. This resulted in SMIC giving him a $3.3 million mansion and raising his salary to $1.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:14:00">[23:14:00]</a>. As of the video's release, he remains co-CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>.

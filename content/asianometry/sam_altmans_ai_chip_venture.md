Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has been working on a significant chip venture for the [[the_ai_and_ai_chip_boom_landscape | AI industry]] [00:00:26]. This initiative was a key area of inquiry during a recent learning tour through Japan and the United States, aiming to understand the [[the_ai_and_ai_chip_boom_landscape | AI and AI chip boom landscape]] outside of Taiwan [00:00:11].

## The Trillion-Dollar Ambition

News about Altman's chip venture emerged gradually [00:00:30]. Initially, reports circulated during his temporary ousting from OpenAI, indicating he was raising "billions" from Middle East investors for a chip venture [00:00:34]. Subsequently, it was reported that Sam Altman and his team engaged in discussions with TSMC, individuals in Abu Dhabi, and the US Government [00:00:44].

The venture gained widespread attention when the Wall Street Journal published a report featuring an "eye catching $1-7 trillion figure" [00:00:52]. This figure sparked significant buzz and became a primary topic of discussion upon arrival in Silicon Valley [00:01:02]. Many observers found the number to be excessively large, suggesting it might serve as a negotiating tactic to manage expectations in future talks [00:01:07]. The idea is that discussing trillions makes hundreds of billions seem less substantial [00:01:15].

Further context was provided by The Information, which clarified Altman's remarks:
> But in reality, Altman privately has told people that figure represents the sum total of investments that participants ... would need to make, in everything from real estate and power for data centers to the manufacturing of the chips, over some period of years [00:01:25].

This "ecosystem concept" offers a more sensible explanation [00:01:41]. For comparison, total semiconductor sales in 2023 were approximately $520 billion, with capital expenditures around $140 billion [00:01:44]. Even if the projected trillion-dollar investment were spread out over five years and included real estate and power costs, it would still represent a "COVID-like step function upwards" in capital expenditure [00:01:55].

The semiconductor industry is characterized by its conservative nature, populated by experienced individuals who have witnessed numerous cycles of booms and busts [00:02:08]. Consequently, Altman's proposal is not the first instance of someone approaching a foundry with a world-changing use case [00:02:17].

## Driving Concept: Scaling Laws

The investment ambition is driven by a concept known as "scaling laws" [00:02:24]. This term originates from a 2020 OpenAI paper titled "Scaling laws for neural language models" [00:02:27]. The fundamental idea is that combining more data and compute resources leads to improved results, specifically less loss [00:02:36].

This core principle was instrumental in OpenAI's development of the GPT-series [00:02:42]. Ilya Sutskever, a co-founder of OpenAI, emphasized this point in a November podcast:
> I was very fortunate in that I was able to realize that the reason neural networks of the time weren't good is because they are too small. So like if you tried to solve a vision task with a neural network with a thousand neurons, what can it do? It can't do anything [00:02:56].
> It doesn't matter how good your learning is and anything else. But if you have a much larger network then it can do something unprecedented [00:03:10].

GPT-3 was large, GPT-4 was even larger and performed significantly better, and GPT-5 is anticipated to be larger still [00:03:18]. As of now, there are no indications that the scaling laws have ceased to apply [00:03:25].

The parallels between scaling laws and the semiconductor industry's Moore's Law are noteworthy [00:03:34]. While not identical in their statements, both laws could exert similar influences on their respective industries [00:03:41]. In the 1980s and 1990s, Moore's Law served as a rallying cry and a metronome for the entire semiconductor industry [00:03:45]. There is a possibility that scaling laws could have a comparable impact on the [[the_ai_and_ai_chip_boom_landscape | AI industry]], providing simple, understandable directives to guide R&D roadmaps for years to come [00:03:56].

Arguments against scaling laws exist, such as the concern that all existing data across the internet has largely been utilized [00:04:09]. However, potential solutions can be found if sufficient funding is available [00:04:18]. Historically, physics problems encountered ahead of Moore's Law were overcome by the semiconductor industry through novel engineering solutions, including High-K Metal Gate, FinFET, DUV Lithography, and Dry Etch [00:04:22].

A more significant question is whether the necessary capital will be available to sustain this investment [00:04:35]. This links directly to the broader question of the [[financial_sustainability_of_ai_investments | financial sustainability of AI investments]] [00:09:09].

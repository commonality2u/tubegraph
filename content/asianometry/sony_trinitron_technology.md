The Trinitron, a breakthrough [[development_of_color_tv_technology | color TV]] by Sony, was the product Sony co-founder Masaru Ibuka was most proud of throughout his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Its development exemplifies Sony's engineering prowess and tenacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It took nearly eight years to bring to market, but upon its release, no other [[development_of_color_tv_technology | color TV]] could compare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Beginnings: Sony's Founders

Sony's foundation rests on its two co-founders:
*   **Masaru Ibuka:** The company's lead engineer, characterized as naive, playful, guileless, but also tenacious, relentlessly driven, and a motivating engineering leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Akio Morita:** Thirteen years younger than Ibuka, Morita was the charismatic business leader and spokesman, pragmatic and focused on getting things done quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Despite being the largest shareholder, Morita deeply respected Ibuka and ensured his team received funding for their projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

They worked together for forty years, rarely arguing, perfectly suited to achieve their dream of bringing consumer electronics to ordinary people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Their initial products included professional audio equipment like Japan's first commercially available tape recorder, the G-type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Early on, Sony licensed the [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | transistor]] from Western Electric, which their engineers used to create popular consumer devices such as the TR-55 and TR-63 pocket radios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Transition to Televisions

Rising competition in transistor radios prompted Sony to explore new categories, with black-and-white televisions being the obvious next step for transistorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. These TVs operated with an electron gun firing electrons at a screen coated with phosphor, which emits light upon impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Deflecting the electron beam to create images required significant energy, making normal Germanium power transistors insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Silicon Transistors

Sony needed stronger [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | transistors]], specifically silicon, due to its higher melting point allowing it to handle elevated temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. In 1956, Ibuka and Kazuo Iwama attended a Bell Labs seminar where silicon was touted as the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Although existing silicon [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | transistors]] were small, Ibuka tasked a team to develop silicon power [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | transistors]] from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Pure silicon was then more expensive than gold, and Sony had to import 20mm crystals from France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Since photolithography hadn't been invented, they used oxide and mesa masking to apply pattern designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### The Micro-TV

Sony's first product utilizing silicon [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | transistors]] was the TV8-301, released in 1960, which was small, fragile, and didn't sell well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Despite the American market's preference for large-screen TVs, Sony's silicon power [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | transistors]] were limited, causing excess power leakage in larger chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This meant transistorized TVs couldn't exceed 5 or 8 inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Ignoring American marketing consultants who predicted failure for small-screen TVs, Ibuka pushed to turn this weakness into a strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Akio Morita, based in New York City, spearheaded the marketing campaign for the "Micro-TV" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Sony hired Volkswagen's advertising agency and its salespeople worked diligently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. These efforts paid off, and the 5-303W Micro-TV sold very well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## The Quest for Color TV

As soon as Sony's engineers completed the Micro-TV, Ibuka began discussions about developing a [[development_of_color_tv_technology | color TV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Early [[development_of_color_tv_technology | Color TV]] Technologies

*   **CBS's Field Sequential System:** Patented in the 1940s, this system used mechanically rotating red, blue, and green filters in front of the camera, creating sequential color images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. A special [[development_of_color_tv_technology | color TV]] would then display these images so rapidly that the human brain perceived a single full-color image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. However, it required a high refresh rate, sending three times the data of black-and-white broadcasts, and was incompatible with existing black-and-white systems due to modified frame rates and small frame sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **RCA's Shadow Mask Tube:** To protect its investment in the black-and-white ecosystem, RCA developed the Shadow Mask Tube as an alternative in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This system used three electron guns (red, green, blue) firing converging beams towards a "Shadow Mask"—a thin metal sheet with tiny holes—positioned in front of a screen with red, blue, and green phosphors arranged in pixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The mask ensured each beam hit only its corresponding color phosphor, creating a perceived full-color image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. It was compatible with existing black-and-white systems, which was its main advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Weaknesses of the Shadow Mask Tube

Initial adoption of [[development_of_color_tv_technology | color TV]] was slow, with only one [[development_of_color_tv_technology | color set]] sold for every fifty black-and-white sets in the US in 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Even with increased [[development_of_color_tv_technology | color TV]] content from NBC by 1962, the Shadow Mask Tube itself had significant flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>:
*   **Low Brightness:** Approximately 85% of electrons hit the mask, not the screen, leading to a maximum of 15% efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **High Manufacturing Cost:** The need for three precisely converging electron guns required extra manufacturing work and manual tuning by skilled workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability to Interference:** External magnetic fields (from appliances or even the Earth) could mess with the beams' aim, causing annoying colored patches on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Complex Mask Production:** The shadow mask itself was difficult to produce, involving chemical, mechanical, and photographic techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Sony's Chromatron Endeavor

Despite RCA's Shadow Mask Tube being widely licensed, Ibuka found copying the market leader "no fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. In 1961, Ibuka and Morita discovered the Chromatron at an IEEE trade show in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Invented by Nobel laureate Dr. Ernest Lawrence in 1951, the Chromatron displayed a remarkably sharp and bright image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Morita was so impressed he immediately secured a technical license from its owner, a Paramount Pictures subsidiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

Senri Miyaoka, a young Japanese physicist, was sent to learn the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. He found the American team struggling with the Chromatron, sensing Sony had taken on a formidable challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Making the Chromatron

The Chromatron aimed to fix the Shadow Mask Tube's three-gun convergence headache by using a single electron gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Its phosphors were arranged in parallel, vertical stripes (green, blue, red) instead of pixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. To ensure the correct color information hit the right phosphor stripe, the Chromatron used a "grill" of up to 400 charged vertical wires positioned inside the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. These wires would activate at precise moments to deflect unwanted electrons, directing the right signal to the right stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

### Troubles with Mass Production

Sony built a new factory in Tokyo for the Chromatron, but mass production faced severe difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. A major challenge was synchronizing the electron beam with the activation and deactivation of the grill's metal lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. While it worked beautifully when synchronized, frequent failures led to "sickening color variations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

In September 1964, a 17-inch Chromatron prototype was displayed, but the factory struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. It was ten times more complicated to produce than a standard shadow mask tube [[development_of_color_tv_technology | color TV]], with only 2 or 3 out of 1,000 sets working correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Ibuka, however, refused to abandon mass production, believing improvement was possible if even one set worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

By 1965, the Sony team realized Dr. Lawrence's original single-gun method was unfeasible due to the high cost of the color-switching grill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. They switched to a three-gun method, similar to RCA's, which reintroduced gun alignment issues but eased tolerances for the vertical wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. In May 1965, a 19-inch Chromatron was released in Japan, selling 13,000 sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Each set, priced at 198,000 yen ($550), cost 400,000 yen ($1,111) to make, and buyers suffered from numerous defects, necessitating a lifetime warranty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

Despite the financial losses and defects, Ibuka refused to switch to the RCA shadow mask, instead doubling down and making the Chromatron Sony's highest priority with 150 team members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

### Increasing Strain

By 1966, as the Shadow Mask Tube system matured and [[development_of_color_tv_technology | color TVs]] went mainstream, Sony's distributors urged the company to release a competitive [[development_of_color_tv_technology | color TV]] in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. The Chromatron continued to lose money, accumulating $700,000 in annual development costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. This created palpable tension between Ibuka, who remained committed, and Morita, who sought to cut losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Accountants began attending engineering sessions, and Morita himself berated the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Nevertheless, Morita covertly secured a $2 million loan to continue funding the R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

In 1966, Ibuka agreed to dissolve the Chromatron team and adopt the Shadow Mask Tube if no viable alternative was found by year-end, personally leading the final push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. The team explored various parallel approaches, with Ibuka actively participating and offering encouragement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## The Trinitron Breakthrough

In 1966, General Electric released its "Portacolor" TV, a Shadow Mask Tube with a single electron gun equipped with three cathodes arranged in a straight line, creating three beams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. This contrasted with the Chromatron's triangular (delta) arrangement of its three guns/beams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

Susumu Yoshida, a Sony manager, investigated the Portacolor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. While unimpressed by its brightness, he was intrigued by the three-cathode, one-gun setup and its potential pairing with the Chromatron's grill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. Yoshida suggested this idea to Senri Miyaoka, who rigged a black-and-white electron gun with two additional cathodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. This arrangement surprisingly produced a bright, albeit blurry, picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. After reviewing Miyaoka's report, Ibuka, in a hurried conversation, received Miyaoka's confirmation that it could work in a commercial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

The following Monday, Ibuka reoriented his entire 7,000-person company towards this new concept, becoming obsessed with its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

### Trinitron Technology

The Trinitron gun was completed by February 1967, and the prototype by November 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. Its design was elegant:
*   **Single Electron Gun:** Equipped with three RGB cathodes arranged in a horizontal line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
*   **Converging Beams:** The three electron beams converge and cross at the center of a large electron lens, which is the origin of the name "Trinitron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.
*   **Deflection Plates:** After crossing, the beams expand and are focused and directed by deflection plates towards the correct phosphor stripe on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   **Aperture Grill:** Replacing the shadow mask, the Trinitron used an aperture grill composed of etched vertical metal wires, one for each color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This grill, while serving the same beam-separating function as the shadow mask, allowed significantly more electrons to pass through, resulting in a much brighter picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. The aperture grill itself presented engineering challenges, particularly thermal expansion from electron bombardment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

## [[impact_of_the_trinitron_on_the_market | Game-changer]]

Sony officially announced the Trinitron on April 15, 1968, with Ibuka himself hosting the press conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Ibuka boldly promised 10,000 Trinitrons for public sale by October, a target much faster than Yoshida's estimated production ramp-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Ibuka inspired the team by referencing the American Manhattan Project and asked Yoshida to "indulge me this once" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. Yoshida, known as "Shogun Yoshida" for his ferocity, led the team to commercialize the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

Initially, Sony released a 12-inch screen version to accelerate commercialization, although dealers desired a 17-inch model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. Competitors falsely attributed the Trinitron's superior brightness and quality to its smaller size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. Six grueling months later, the first Trinitron sets rolled off the Tokyo factory line, marking the culmination of an eight-year, $12 million development effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

The Trinitron broke RCA's long-standing virtual monopoly on [[development_of_color_tv_technology | color TVs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. Its far brighter screen and simpler production process quickly made it dominant in the small [[development_of_color_tv_technology | color TV]] market in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. By March 1969, Sony was selling 10,000 sets monthly, soon increasing to 20,000, necessitating new factories in San Diego and the UK to meet demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

From 1968 to 1998, Sony sold an astounding 180 million Trinitrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. Sony finally phased out the Trinitron line in the 2000s as [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCD]] and other [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | semiconductor displays]] took over the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Remarkably, the Trinitron system remained largely unchanged for some twenty years after its introduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. It was one of the last Sony products directly overseen by Ibuka before his transition to personal pursuits like youth education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

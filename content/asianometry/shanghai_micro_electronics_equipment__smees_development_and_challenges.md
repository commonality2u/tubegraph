Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) is China's ambitious project aimed at replacing [[comparison_between_smee_and_asml | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The company has garnered significant attention and cheerleading within the Chinese media, especially after recent high-profile export bans to China brought them into special focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This article examines SMEE's history, capabilities, and the [[challenges in the semiconductor industry | challenges]] it faces, drawing heavily from an EqualOcean deep dive profile and various China-based sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Early Chinese Lithography Efforts

China's first lithography machine, the GK-3, was created in 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Two years later, it evolved into the JKG-3, the first domestically created lithography machine for large-scale commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The GK-4 prototype, a contact lithography machine able to print chips on 75mm wafers, followed in 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Contact lithography, invented and commercialized by the United States in the 1950s, involves direct contact between the photomask and the photoresist-coated substrate, but is known for high defect rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. At this point, China was approximately two decades behind the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Subsequently, China simultaneously attempted to develop proximity aligners (which introduce a gap between mask and substrate) and step-and-scan devices (steppers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   In 1981, the Institute of Semiconductors of the Chinese Academy of Sciences successfully developed two proximity aligner prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   By 1985, the 45th Institute of the Ministry of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering developed their own stepper, "inspired" by the US-based GCA 4800 DSW, which printed designs using the 436 nanometer G-line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   In 2000, China began research on machines using argon fluoride lasers (193nm wavelength) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. However, the West began shipping such devices in 1990, indicating a persistent technology gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Founding and Mission of SMEE

SMEE was founded in March 2002, a move indicating the Chinese government's perceived need for a change in direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The company was designated the "national champion" for China's "Zero Two Special Project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This project was part of China's 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015), ranking lithography as the second-highest priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

The "Zero Two Special Project" had several goals:
*   Develop manufacturing equipment for 22nm to 45nm processed chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   Conduct forward research on 14nm to 22nm processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   Work on 65nm to 90nm special processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Capture at least 10% of the domestic lithography market and attempt to enter the international market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

SMEE's first office was located in the Shanghai Zhangjiang High-Tech Park, a semiconductor hub alongside companies like SMIC, Gray Semiconductor, and Spreadtrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The company's founding general manager and chairman, Ha Rong Ming, was known for his intense dedication, working long hours for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Government Support and IP Development
SMEE has received extensive support from both local and central Chinese governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The Shanghai SASAC (State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission) is SMEE's largest owner, holding 32% of its shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Over two decades, SMEE has developed products through extensive R&D, filing over 3,000 patents by 2019 and receiving 1,600, with nearly 700 patents in foreign countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Development Strategy and Market Penetration

Due to import restrictions on high-level optics from companies like Carl Zeiss of Germany, SMEE initially targeted less intense segments of the lithography market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Advanced Packaging Lithography
SMEE decided to focus on lithography for advanced packaging processes, which involve placing and connecting chips in their protective casing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This strategy allowed the company to gain experience in back-end lithography before moving to front-end lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This approach has shown traction, with SMEE products holding 80% of the domestic market in back-end lithography, corresponding to 40% of the global market in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. In 2019, they shipped over 50 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Major back-end customers include Chiang Jang Electric Group, Taiwan-based ASE Group, and Tongfu Microelectronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Expansion into Niche Semiconductor Products
After its success in packaging, SMEE expanded into lithography tools for other niche semiconductor products:
*   Power devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
*   [[Economic Challenges in the MEMS Industry | Micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
*   LEDs (considered the most promising of these markets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>

### Front-End Lithography Aspirations
SMEE eventually began developing for the front end, intending to sell to companies like Yangtze Memory and SMIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## ASML Model and Supply Chain Challenges

Unlike Japanese competitors Canon and Nikon, SMEE is structured similarly to [[comparison_between_smee_and_asml | ASML]], aiming to be the final system integrator for lithography tool components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Core factors for a successful lithography machine include:
1.  High precision optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>
2.  The light source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>
3.  High precision mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>
4.  Software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>

ASML, for example, relies on companies like Cymer for light sources and has a joint venture with Carl Zeiss for optics, often holding significant equity in or outright owning these critical suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

SMEE faces challenges in securing domestic suppliers for these critical components:
*   **Optics**: EqualOcean identifies Changchun Up Optotech and Beijing Guowang Technology Company as potential Carl Zeiss equivalents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Changchun Up Optotech is no longer associated with SMEE, leaving Beijing Guowang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Beijing Guowang is building an optics manufacturing factory, not expected to be completed until September 2023, meaning mass supply of an immersion-ready optical system is years away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Light Source**: SMEE's Cymer equivalent is Beijing RS Laser Optoelectronics Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. RS Laser's product is underpowered compared to what ASML uses for its immersion systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Other Core Technologies**: A number of core technologies still need to be imported or purchased from foreign companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. For instance, the vast majority of photomasks (plates holding the chip pattern) are made by Japanese companies Toppan Printing and Dai Nippon Printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Although Chinese company Jiangsu Nata Opto-Electronic Material Company (Nata) has created a photomask that works in an ASML immersion system, other components like ball bearings (from Sweden), valves (from France), and grating alignment systems (from the United States) are not made in China, hindering commercial-grade machine shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Product Capabilities and Technology Gap

As of August 2021, SMEE systems are for 90nm, 110nm, and 280nm processes, specialized for back-end lithography, LED, [[Economic Challenges in the MEMS Industry | MEMS]], and power devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Most SMEE systems use eyeline and krypton fluoride lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### Advanced System Limitations
SMEE's most advanced system, the SSA/600-20 scanner for front-end manufacturing at the 90nm node, uses an argon fluoride (ArF) laser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. A prototype (600-10) was first profiled in 2011, capable of processing about 50 wafers per hour with a field size of 22mm x 32mm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Comparable Canon and Nikon machines can process up to five times that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The 600-20 iteration, as of 2019, was not selling in relevant quantities, with recent sales still primarily in outdated eyeline lithography machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

### The 28nm Prototype Challenge
SMEE has an argon fluoride immersion (ArFi) system prototype, stated to be capable of the 28nm process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. While China has been good at building prototypes, typically lagging the leading edge by about 10 years (the 28nm node began shipping around 2011), the challenge lies in transitioning from prototype to high-volume commercial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. China has historically struggled to turn prototypes into commercially competitive products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

The goal was to deliver commercial-ready 28nm ArFi machines in 2021 or 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. However, this deadline is likely to be missed, as the critical optics supplier, Beijing Guowang, is not expected to complete its foundry until September 2023, making a 2024 ship date ambitious and unlikely to be commercially competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Commercial Readiness vs. Prototypes
Chinese news sources often exaggerate prototype announcements. For example, in November 2018, the Institute of OptoElectronics Technology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced a 22nm "super resolution" lithography tool, with claims that multi-patterning could achieve sub-10nm levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. However, this tool was not commercially ready; its accuracy was low, and its field of view was only a few square millimeters, making wafer processing extremely slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. In contrast, [[comparison_between_smee_and_asml | ASML]]'s Twinscan NXT:1970Ci, a comparable DUV machine capable of 38nm and below, offers a field of view of 858 square millimeters and can process over 250 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

## Human Capital Challenges

A significant issue for SMEE is its human capital strategy compared to [[comparison_between_smee_and_asml | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Salaries**: While SMEE's average PhD salary is similar to [[comparison_between_smee_and_asml | ASML]]'s company-wide average salary, there's a significant pay gap at higher levels, with ASML staff software engineers earning nearly $200,000 USD annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Benefits**: [[comparison_between_smee_and_asml | ASML]] offers generous benefits like a share purchase plan, pension plan, commuting allowance, 40 days of paid leave, and holiday allowance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. SMEE, lacking [[comparison_between_smee_and_asml | ASML]]'s capital base (Europe's most valuable tech company at $300 billion), struggles to offer comparable benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Working Culture**: As a Chinese "national champion" with expectations akin to Huawei, SMEE has adopted Huawei's working practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This includes long working hours, considerable political intervention, tough annual assessments, and a "Jack Welch-style" 5-10% annual layoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This approach contrasts with [[comparison_between_smee_and_asml | ASML]]'s focus on employee development and turnover reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. The Huawei-inspired approach is likely to make it difficult for SMEE to acquire and retain top talent, which is crucial in the semiconductor manufacturing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## Public Perception vs. Reality

SMEE's efforts receive extensive coverage in the Chinese press, often referred to as the "Mount Everest" of the intelligent manufacturing industry, accompanied by significant cheerleading and optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. This rhetoric, exemplified by statements like "there is nothing that can't be done by us Chinese" given past achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, can be counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

The reality is that SMEE is at least 20 years behind [[comparison_between_smee_and_asml | ASML]] in bringing a commercial-ready upper-class lithography device to market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Immersion lithography is nascent, and EUV is even further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. This reality is acknowledged even by Chinese sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Such outrageous claims lead to pessimism when deadlines are missed and prevent a clear focus on actual problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

Despite the challenges, the [[future prospects for Chinese semiconductor manufacturing | Chinese semiconductor production equipment ecosystem]] is not "dead on arrival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. Progress in backend lithography and LED lithography is encouraging, especially as [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China gains market share in the display industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. A few Chinese companies have built strong track records in specific semiconductor equipment areas, with one even acquiring TSMC as a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

## Future Outlook

SMEE is reportedly considering an IPO in the future, with valuations potentially in the $5-10 billion range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. An IPO would lead to the release of new information in their prospectus, allowing for further analysis of the company's trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

Nikita Khrushchev's leadership, from 1953 to 1964, saw a series of reforms in the Soviet Union, including the significant normalization and adoption of [[soviet_computer_development_history | cybernetics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This marked a notable shift from the previous Stalin era, where [[soviet_computer_development_history | cybernetics]] had been banned.

## Reversing Stalin's Ban
During Stalin's reign, [[soviet_computer_development_history | cybernetics]] had been prohibited due to ideological objections, including assertions that information was a substance of its own and for drawing analogies between the neuron in the brain and electric signals inside a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Such analogies were seen as encroaching on established Russian theories of psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

Khrushchev's reversal allowed [[soviet_computer_development_history | cybernetics]] to thrive, expanding to encompass a variety of sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Promoting Cybernetics at the 20th Party Congress
At the 20th Congress of the Communist Party in 1956, where Khrushchev famously gave his secret speech criticizing Stalin, he also delivered a far less controversial speech praising [[soviet_computer_development_history | cybernetics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. He hailed [[soviet_computer_development_history | cybernetics]] as "one of the major tools of the creation of a communist Society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

This endorsement led to Khrushchev encouraging the development of computer science and the automation of industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Impact on Soviet Computing
Khrushchev's promotion of [[soviet_computer_development_history | cybernetics]] had several key impacts:
*   **Military Computing**: The revelation of the American SAGE air defense system in 1958, powered by the largest computer built at the time, greatly alarmed Soviet military planners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. In response, the Soviets developed their own centralized computer networks for air defense, missile defense, and space surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Khrushchev famously boasted in 1962 that the prototype air defense network, System A, could "hit a fly in outer space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This military effort opened people's eyes to the potential of networked computers for civilian use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Economic Reform Proposals**: The burgeoning field of [[soviet_computer_development_history | cybernetics]] and computing inspired proposals for economic reform. Anatoli Kitov, a pioneer in [[soviet_computer_development_history | cybernetics]], proposed the first effort to network the nation in 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. In January 1959, Kitov wrote to the Communist Party Central Committee, urging Khrushchev to accelerate the Soviet economy's adoption of computers for economic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. While Khrushchev likely did not see this specific letter, the proposals gained support within the government, leading to a resolution called "the speeding and widening of the production of calculation machines and their application to the National economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Support for OGAS Research**: In 1962, Soviet cyberneticist Victor Glushkov, head of the Kiev Institute of [[soviet_computer_development_history | Cybernetics]], sent a letter to Khrushchev highlighting the growing technology gap with the West and calling for accelerated Soviet computerization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Concerned by this gap, the Soviet leadership approved research into the idea of [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | economic reform]] through automated computer networks (ASUS) in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. This research eventually led to the development of the [[concept_and_vision_of_the_soviet_internet_ogas | OGAS]] project, envisioned as an "All State Automated System for the Management of the Economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Glushkov's initial [[concept_and_vision_of_the_soviet_internet_ogas | OGAS]] proposals even included a moneyless system of receipts over the network, possibly to appeal to Khrushchev's appreciation for the Marxist ideal of a money-free society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

## Khrushchev's Downfall and Shifting Priorities
Despite his initial support and encouragement, Khrushchev lost power in 1964 and was replaced by Leonid Brezhnev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. Brezhnev subsequently reversed many of Khrushchev's [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | economic reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. While the directive for economic restructuring via computer remained on the agenda due to high-level backing from figures like Premier Alexei Kosygin, the [[concept_and_vision_of_the_soviet_internet_ogas | OGAS]] project faced significant [[impact_of_bureaucratic_infighting_on_soviet_technological_advancements | bureaucratic infighting]] and was never fully implemented as envisioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

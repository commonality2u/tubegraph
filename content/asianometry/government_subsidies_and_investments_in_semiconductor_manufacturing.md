Governments worldwide are increasingly discussing and implementing subsidies and investments to boost their domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. This trend involves significant financial commitments from major global players.

## Global Initiatives

Several countries and economic blocs are dedicating substantial funds to expand or establish semiconductor fabrication plants (fabs):
*   **China** has a $20 billion semiconductor plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, contributing to [[developments_in_chinas_domestic_semiconductor_ecosystem | developments in its domestic semiconductor ecosystem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. For instance, SMIC is receiving funds from the Shenzhen government for a $2.35 billion project to build a wafer fab expected to produce 40,000 wafers per month by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **The United States**, under President Joe Biden, included $50 billion for semiconductors in his stimulus plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **The European Union (EU)** is assembling a 145 billion euro initiative to establish a 2-nanometer cutting-edge fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, as part of [[eu_efforts_and_initiatives_to_revitalize_the_european_semiconductor_industry | their efforts to revitalize the European semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### U.S. Legislation and Impact

In the U.S., two significant pieces of legislation aim to bolster the semiconductor industry:
*   **The CHIPS Act** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>
*   **The American Foundries Act** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>

These acts propose:
*   Establishment of an R&D fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   A 20-40% tax credit for the acquisition of semiconductor production equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

The tax credit is expected to have a short-term impact, affecting production for three to five years or one fab generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Conversely, the R&D fund is anticipated to have longer-lasting effects, particularly in fostering public-private partnerships, such as the one that led to the creation of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Distortions from Subsidies
> Government subsidies, by their nature, create distortions in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The intention of subsidies is to encourage more manufacturing within the country, which they can achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. However, unless these subsidies are permanent, the subsidized fabs will eventually need to become self-sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The continuation of these credits may face increased scrutiny once immediate crises, like the current chip shortage, subside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## Current Fab Build-Outs

The world is experiencing a significant build-out of fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>:
*   **TSMC** is constructing its Arizona fab, which has been ongoing for a year and may be upscaled from its original plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This facility is projected to have 25,000 to 100,000 wafer starts per month upon completion, depending on its final size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Samsung** is negotiating a major investment to expand its Austin fab, involving tens of billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   Even smaller, "second-tier" foundries are upgrading or building new fab capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, with many press releases from companies not focused on sub-10nm process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Global Foundries** is investing $1.4 billion in expansion and accelerating its IPO, possibly to secure capital or for Middle Eastern investors to cash out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

This global expansion is expected to bring hundreds of thousands of wafers to the market over the next one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. The question remains how this significant increase in capacity will impact the market, particularly as consumer demand shifts with people returning to work and school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The US Department of Defense, for example, purchases 1.9 billion semiconductors annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, a fraction of the theoretical 3.5 billion dies a single TSMC Arizona fab could produce in a month at 50,000 wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

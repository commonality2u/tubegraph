The Hard Disk Drive (HDD) industry, initially dominated by US firms, underwent significant transformations due to globalization and evolving manufacturing strategies, particularly from the mid-1980s onward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## International Competition
While Japanese and European companies did enter the HDD market, American firms proactively globalized their manufacturing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. The four major Japanese computer manufacturers – Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC, and Toshiba – initially produced their HDDs for internal use only before adopting an OEM model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

## Shifting Manufacturing Hubs
A significant change occurred in 1984 when Seagate began outsourcing the assembly of its HDDs to Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Several other American HDD manufacturers followed this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. This move was facilitated by the Singapore Government's Economic Development Board, becoming a notable instance of Asian industrial policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. By 1990, Singapore emerged as the world's largest producer of HDDs, accounting for 55% of global shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

As labor costs in Singapore increased, lower-value work, such as assembling the actuator arm holding the read/write head, migrated to other Southeast Asian regions like Malaysia or Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Simultaneously, Singaporeans transitioned to more specialized tasks, including fabricating platters or assembling complex HDD systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. Eventually, Japanese firms also started outsourcing their production abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. In the early 2000s, Japanese companies even gained a majority share of the HDD market when Hitachi merged with IBM, before renewed competition and further mergers diminished their advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

## Impact on US Employment and Industry
The aggressive globalization pursued by American firms allowed them to retain significant market share despite intense competition from Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. By the mid-1990s, there were no longer any HDD assembly factories in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. However, higher-paying American jobs in R&D, head manufacturing, and gimbals were largely preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.

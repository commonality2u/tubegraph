South Korea has historically implemented various strategies to develop and manage its shipping industry, recognizing its crucial role in trade and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01"></a>. The nation's economy is highly dependent on trade, which necessitates robust maritime shipping capabilities, as shipping carries approximately 80% of the world's trade by volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01"></a>.

## Early Development and Government Support

The origins of major South Korean transportation entities like the [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | Hanjin Group]] show a strong connection to government support from the outset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25"></a>.

*   **Foundation and early growth**: [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | Hanjin Group]] founder Cho Chun-hun, who started with a few trucks in 1945, focused on transportation and received early jobs from the US Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25"></a>. After the Korean War, to meet new demand and scale his business, Cho sought capital from the national government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44"></a>.
*   **Park Chung-hee's economic plan**: President Park Chung-hee integrated loyal companies into his economic growth plan, offering generous loans from state banks to those who participated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54"></a>. The [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | Hanjin Group]] benefited significantly from this cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04"></a>. [[Rise and fall of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] itself was founded in 1977, a decade after Cho Chun-hun observed [[Container shipping industrys global significance | container shipping]] in Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46"></a>.

## Fostering Indigenous Container Capacity

In the early 1970s, South Korea's container shipping capacity was minimal, with only three container vessels in 1972 and most trade handled by foreign liners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59"></a>.

*   **Policy shift**: The Korean government decided to prioritize developing its own indigenous container capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08"></a>. New policies were introduced to encourage the first generation of containerized shipping lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10"></a>.
*   **Subsidies and guidance**: By 1976, the country had expanded to 36 ships and five international container shipping lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17"></a>. Despite this growth, 90% of Korean container exports and imports still relied on foreign carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24"></a>. Consequently, in 1976, the government began explicitly subsidizing Korean container carriers, providing up to $1 million USD per year to each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31"></a>. The Korea Maritime and Port Administration was also established to guide the industry's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43"></a>. [[Rise and fall of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] leveraged this national policy push to expand its container service lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51"></a>.

## Regulation and Consolidation

Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, during a period of massive Korean export boom, the government actively managed the shipping industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10"></a>.

*   **Managed market**: The Korean government carefully managed the industry, similar to a bonsai tree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30"></a>. Companies were restricted to specific routes, and new entrants were barred from the domestic market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35"></a>. For example, Korea Marine Transport Corporation and [[Rise and fall of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin]] were assigned the lucrative Korea to US West Coast lanes, while Hyundai was directed to routes connecting to Japan and Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42"></a>.
*   **Encouraged mergers**: The government allowed [[Rise and fall of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin]] to acquire the struggling Korea Shipping Corporation in 1988, which helped [[Rise and fall of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin]] become the 13th largest container shipping line globally and the largest in South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15"></a>.

## [[Reforms and Challenges in South Koreas Economic Landscape | Post-Asian Financial Crisis Reforms]]

The [[political_and_financial_environment_in_south_korea | Asian financial crisis]] in the late 1990s significantly impacted South Korea's economic strategies, particularly after the country received a financial bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54"></a>. The IMF mandated policy changes aligned with neoliberal governance beliefs of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08"></a>.

*   **Market liberalization**: The Korean government was compelled to liberalize its shipping business, opening the market to foreign players at a much faster pace than initially planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23"></a>. This exposed Korean shippers fully to the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36"></a>.
*   **Debt reduction mandate**: All South Korean business conglomerates were mandated to reduce their debt-to-equity ratios to below 200%, regardless of business or industry conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41"></a>. This forced companies like [[Rise and fall of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] to sell off owned ships to pay down debt and charter new ones to maintain capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53"></a>. While improving debt ratios, this led to significantly higher operating costs due to short-term charter prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13"></a>. This combination of higher operating costs and new foreign competition contributed to a long-term decline in Korea's indigenous shipping lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29"></a>.

## Shift in Bailout Policy

By 2016, a critical shift in the South Korean government's approach to financially distressed shipping lines became apparent.

*   **[[Rise and fall of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin Shipping]]'s financial woes**: In 2016, [[Rise and fall of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] faced significant debt, with Korea Development Bank (KDB) being its largest creditor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54"></a>. KDB demanded 700 billion won, but [[Rise and fall of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin]] could only offer 500 billion won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57"></a>.
*   **Refusal to bail out**: Unlike other countries that bailed out their major shipping lines (e.g., Denmark with Maersk, Germany with Hapag-Lloyd, France with CMA CGM, China with Cosco), the Korean government decided not to bail out [[Rise and fall of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10"></a>. KDB was also dealing with Hyundai Merchant Marine, and while Hyundai was able to meet restructuring demands and family capital injections, [[Rise and fall of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin]] could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34"></a>.
*   **Rationale and impact**: The government's decision echoed the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008, driven by a reluctance to use taxpayer money for corporate entities, especially given public sentiment against the [[South Koreas Chaebol and Economic Influence | Hanjin]] family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50"></a>. This decision, however, caused global chaos in the shipping industry, stranding $4 billion worth of goods and impacting thousands of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11"></a>. Key Korean exports, including 40% of Samsung's electronics and 20% of LG's products, were affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27"></a>.
*   **Policy shift**: The government's decision not to bail out [[Rise and fall of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] signaled a departure from its long-standing policy of supporting the industry as a core national interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35"></a>. In contrast, Taiwan's government bailed out its shipping lines, Evergreen and Yang Ming, in late 2016, with their Deputy Minister of Transportation stating that governments must support the industry before damage becomes uncontrollable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35"></a>.

The **[[Rise and fall of Hanjin Shipping | collapse of Hanjin Shipping]]** in 2016 ultimately stemmed from a working capital crisis, poor chartering practices, the inability to rely on sister companies for financial support after the founder's death, and crucially, the government's decision to withhold a bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01"></a>.

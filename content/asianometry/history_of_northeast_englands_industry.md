Northeast England was historically a major industrial region [00:00:07]. However, following the decline of its traditional heavy industries, the area struggled to identify a new sector for economic growth [00:00:09].

## Economic Landscape of Northeast England

Northeast England, one of the four countries comprising the UK, is the least populated first-level region within England, with fewer than 2.7 million residents [00:01:07]. As of 2012, its residents had the lowest median gross annual earnings in England and the highest proportion of the population claiming income support [00:01:17].

The region has faced a significant employment gap compared to the rest of the UK since at least the 1930s [00:01:30]. In 1995, its unemployment rate was 9.1%, 50% higher than the national average [00:01:37].

### Decline of Heavy Industry

The area's economic challenges stem from its long-standing dependence on heavy industry and its rich coal mines [00:01:48]. After World War II, the British government nationalized the coal and steel industries in the Northeast [00:01:53]. The Ministry of Fuel and Power aimed to maximize output and employment in these resource-based economies, advocating against the introduction of new male-employing manufacturing industries [00:01:59]. This policy left Northeast England overly reliant on coal and steel [00:02:12].

When de-industrialization began in the 1980s, the region had few alternative industries [00:02:15]. Tensions escalated with the Miners' Strike of 1984-1985, where miners sought to prevent mine closures rather than demanding higher wages [00:02:22]. Following the strike's defeat, many mines were found to be depleted of cheaply mined coal, with imported coal being significantly cheaper, leading to thousands of job losses [00:02:32].

By the 1990s, Northeast England felt marginalized in the global economy and believed London did not prioritize their concerns [00:02:45]. For instance, the Barnett formula, a 1970s Treasury mechanism for public spending allocation, resulted in Scotland receiving substantially more public funding, which was used to offer more attractive investment packages to multinational companies [00:03:01].

## [[siemens_semiconductor_investment_in_north_tyneside | Siemens Semiconductor]] Investment

Against this backdrop, the prospect of a [[siemens_semiconductor_investment_in_north_tyneside | semiconductor manufacturing]] facility was highly anticipated [00:03:19]. In 1995, the German company Siemens, an old-fashioned firm founded in 1847, approached the Invest in Britain Bureau about establishing a wafer fabrication facility [00:03:22].

Siemens had a history of being supported by the German government, benefiting from policies that favored domestic production, such as the Bundesbank's requirement for firms to produce equipment in Germany, often leading to lucrative orders for Siemens [00:03:38]. However, by the 1980s, deregulation trends in the US and UK compelled Siemens to become more competitive, international, shareholder-friendly, and market-oriented [00:04:18].

### The Semiconductor Market Boom

The global semiconductor industry was booming in the 1990s, driven by the release of Windows 95 and the rise of mobile phones [00:04:35]. The industry grew 29% in 1993, 32% in 1994, and 42% in 1995, investing a staggering $30 billion in new chip fabrication facilities (fabs) in 1995 [00:04:55].

Siemens Semiconductors, initially an in-house chip producer for other Siemens divisions, began competing for its own customers in the 1990s [00:05:16]. They focused on niche markets like Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) for telecommunications, mobile phones, and automotive industries [00:05:27]. Sales grew 40% annually in the early 1990s, making Siemens the 12th largest semiconductor maker globally by 1994 [00:05:42]. Despite a 7% market share in Europe, their worldwide share was only 1.9%, indicating significant growth potential [00:06:02].

In 1994, [[siemens_semiconductor_investment_in_north_tyneside | Siemens Semiconductor]] launched a plan to triple chip sales and enter the industry's top 10, largely through international expansion [00:06:11]. This included establishing semiconductor operations outside Germany, such as assembly plants in Malaysia and Portugal, strategic alliances, and electronics assembly plants in China [00:06:21]. As part of this strategy, Siemens planned four new large-scale fabrication plants [00:06:40].

### North Tyneside as a Location

The proposed UK fab was to be an exact copy of a successful 16-megabyte DRAM facility Siemens had recently completed in Dresden [00:07:02]. It was projected to cost 1.1 billion British pounds (or $785 million USD) and directly create 2,000 new jobs, making it the UK's largest-ever inward investment at the time [00:07:05].

Siemens considered various locations, including Ireland, Austria, Israel, Singapore, and Vietnam, with Ireland and Austria being the primary competitors [00:07:19]. Key criteria for the fab location included:
*   Skilled people at low cost [00:07:34]
*   Excellent water and power infrastructure [00:07:36]
*   Geological stability [00:07:39]
*   Ample government support [00:07:41]

North Tyneside met all these requirements, offering skilled technicians willing to work shifts, access to electronics and computing graduates from local and Scottish universities, and salaries 50% lower than in Austria or Germany [00:07:44]. The UK government even offered a direct connection to the national grid, a first for a private company, to address electricity concerns [00:08:05].

Local development agencies actively lobbied Siemens officials, providing tours, arranging university presentations, and offering government support [00:08:16]. UK public support for the project totaled 64 million pounds ($45 million USD), though not all was used, coming in the form of tax exemptions, grants, and job training subsidies [00:08:34]. While other countries like Austria offered more generous packages (120 million pounds or $85 million USD), the investment was seen as strategic [00:08:50].

Securing the [[siemens_semiconductor_investment_in_north_tyneside | Siemens fab]] was considered a significant opportunity because Siemens Semiconductor was a globally renowned name, and such investments were rare [00:09:10]. It was hoped to establish the area as a semiconductor hub, attracting suppliers and other semiconductor companies [00:09:17]. Fujitsu had already built a fab in Northeast England in 1989 with a subsidy package three times larger [00:09:22]. Additionally, the UK government saw an opportunity to transfer technology and skills to the local population and reduce semiconductor imports from Europe [00:09:40].

Siemens' decision to choose the UK was influenced by its commitment to the UK market, where its revenue had grown 25% annually from 1985 to 1995 [00:10:04]. Siemens was the UK's 13th largest R&D investor overall and third largest in electronics, employing 10,000 workers across a dozen manufacturing sites [00:10:13].

The announcement of the deal led to an immediate outpouring of public interest, with local job centers inundated with inquiries; one center received 4,000 calls in three hours [00:10:28].

### Construction and Operation

Semiconductor fabs are built in phases to quickly begin wafer production and capitalize on favorable market conditions [00:10:38]. The North Tyneside fab was planned in two phases:
*   **Phase One:** Completed by mid-1997, producing 16-megabyte DRAM memory units using a 0.35-micron process [00:10:57].
*   **Phase Two:** Planned to produce more advanced 64-megabyte memory units using a 0.25-micron process, eventually increasing capacity to 20,000 wafer starts per month and meeting the full 2,000 job requirement [00:11:07].

Construction of the fab proceeded rapidly, breaking ground even before the company owned the land [00:11:22]. Siemens used an innovative steel frame to accelerate the build, completing the facility in just 376 days [00:11:29]. Production began in May 1997, and Queen Elizabeth II herself toured the facility, declaring that it brought the country to the forefront of [[challenges_faced_by_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_england | semiconductor manufacturing]] [00:11:38].

## Failure of [[challenges_faced_by_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_england | Semiconductor Manufacturing]] in North Tyneside

Despite the initial optimism, Siemens delayed Phase Two of the Tyneside plant in 1997, and in July 1998, announced the entire facility would close by year-end, less than two years after opening [00:12:02].

### Reasons for Closure

The North Tyneside fab was inherently vulnerable due to its focus on the DRAM market, which is highly volatile and prone to oversupply [00:12:21]. DRAM chips are a cheap commodity, competing primarily on price, and are relatively easy to fabricate with little product differentiation [00:12:32]. The market is dominated by numerous competitors, particularly from Asia, with South Korea holding a 40% market share [00:12:43].

Siemens' decision to equip the fab with older 16-megabyte memory technology was perilous; it was already becoming outdated by 1995, as German plants were moving to 64-megabyte production [00:12:58]. The intent behind building the fab in a cheaper location was to continue producing these older memory modules profitably, but this strategy proved flawed [00:13:14]. Producing leading-edge 64-megabyte DRAM or logic chips (like those from Intel and AMD) would have been a more sensible approach [00:13:38].

The semiconductor market crashed in 1998, especially in memory. The price per megabyte plummeted from $27 to just $4 by the time the Tyneside plant opened in 1997, and further to $2 by 1998 [00:13:47]. Chips that sold for $50 in 1995 were selling for just $1 in 1998 [00:14:04]. Semiconductor giants in South Korea, facing the Asian financial crisis, ramped up memory wafer production to survive, exacerbating the oversupply [00:14:11].

Industry-wide profits collapsed. Siemens Semiconductor, which made a 109 million deutsche mark ($65 million USD) profit in the year ended September 1997, recorded a stunning loss of 1.2 billion deutsche mark ($722 million USD) by 1998 [00:14:20].

### Internal and External Factors

To cut costs, [[siemens_semiconductor_investment_in_north_tyneside | Siemens Semiconductor]] decided to close the UK plant [00:14:56]. Economically, the plant lacked scale, having only a third of the capacity of Siemens' Dresden plants [00:15:02]. Furthermore, the UK plant had no strong internal or external backers [00:15:13]. Siemens would not close its German or Austrian plants, and its joint ventures in the US, France, and Taiwan were difficult to exit [00:15:17].

The pro-British management who initially championed the plant's construction, including the CEO, lost their jobs [00:15:27]. The new [[siemens_semiconductor_investment_in_north_tyneside | Siemens Semiconductor]] CEO, while not anti-Britain, was strongly pro-Germany and implemented cost-cutting measures to refocus on core markets [00:15:35]. The closure was costly, estimated at nearly a quarter of a billion dollars, representing 45% of the division's projected loss that year [00:15:48]. Siemens also had to repay government grant money, likely exceeding 15 million pounds [00:16:03]. In August 1999, [[siemens_semiconductor_investment_in_north_tyneside | Siemens Semiconductor]] was spun off into a new company, now known as Infineon Technologies [00:16:11].

## Atmel's Attempted Revival

After the closure, rumors of potential buyers circulated [00:16:22]. In September 2000, Atmel, a semiconductor firm producing higher-value products like flash NAND memory, radio frequency ICs, and logic products, acquired the facility from Siemens for 25 million pounds ($35 million USD) [00:16:27]. Atmel announced plans to invest 700 million pounds ($800 million USD) to retool the plant for flash memory and microcontroller circuits, which typically have more stable markets than DRAM [00:16:54].

However, the dot-com crash in 2001 impacted Atmel, leading to a loss of 31 million pounds ($45 million) and a 23% decline in revenues [00:17:09]. Atmel laid off 26% of its workforce, interrupting its Northeast England investment plans [00:17:19]. Although recovery seemed possible for a few years, Atmel committed to a "fab-light" model in 2006, leading them to divest four fabs, including the North Tyneside facility in 2007 [00:17:30]. TSMC bought all the semiconductor production equipment, and the empty buildings were sold off, effectively ending the [[challenges_faced_by_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_england | semiconductor dream]] for the region [00:17:44].

## Legacy and Future Outlook

Today, the former fab facility has been transformed into the Cobalt Business Park, hosting government offices, call centers, and regional offices [00:17:55]. The closure of the North Tyneside fab was part of a larger trend; 1998 alone saw 3,400 manufacturing job losses in Northeast England, including factories belonging to Electrolux and Pringle [00:18:04]. The Fujitsu fab, opened in 1989, also eventually closed [00:18:21].

A persistent challenge for the local economy is its reliance on external corporate leadership, as many factory jobs were provided by companies with little attachment to the region, who often prioritized their homelands during financial crises [00:18:29].

Despite these setbacks, there are "green shoots" emerging in the [[economic_transition_and_potential_of_renewable_energy_in_northeast_england | energy space]], particularly in [[economic_transition_and_potential_of_renewable_energy_in_northeast_england | renewable energy]] [00:18:58]. Companies have begun investing in Northeast England's growing wind industry, with projects like the Darker Bank wind farm poised to become one of the largest globally [00:19:04]. This offers a glimmer of positive news for a region that has faced considerable economic hardship [00:19:14].

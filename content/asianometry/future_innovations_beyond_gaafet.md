The semiconductor industry is continuously looking ahead, past current advancements like the [[gateallaround_gaafet_transistor_technology|Gate-All-Around (GAAFET)]] transistor. The premier R&D institute for the semiconductor industry, imec, located in Belgium, is actively exploring transistor structures that will extend technological capabilities even further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

## Next-Generation Transistor Designs

### Forkshet
One promising design currently under investigation is the forksheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Conceptually, a forksheet can be visualized as a bundle of vertically stacked sheets with a wall placed down through their middle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. This design represents an evolutionary step from the [[gateallaround_gaafet_transistor_technology|GAAFET]] and offers enhanced gate control over the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

### Complementary FET (CFET)
Following the forksheet concept, imec has also presented the Complementary FET, or CFET <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. This design involves folding the nanosheets or fins on top of one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, which would result in a true 3D transistor structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

## Future Outlook
While these designs are under active research and development, the semiconductor industry has not yet begun considering their production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Currently, the focus remains on impending advancements such as TSMC's N2 process node, anticipated in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. This ongoing work, however, underscores the industry's continuous forward-looking approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), also known as North Korea, has long pursued self-sufficiency in food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Reliable information about the country, particularly regarding its agricultural instability and government actions, is difficult to obtain, often relying on anecdotes and rumors due to the lack of credible official channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Historical Context and Geographical Challenges

Historically, the northern part of Korea was its industrial heartland, while the south served as its breadbasket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This specialization is reflected in North Korea's geography:
*   Approximately 80% of North Korea's land consists of mountains and uplands with deep valleys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   Most of its 25 million people live on the coastal plains and lowlands of the west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   Only about 15% of the country's land is arable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
*   Most farms are concentrated on the west coast due to more favorable land, weather, and growing seasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

The cropping season is generally short, with harsh winters, and short, hot, humid, and rainy summers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. A significant 60% of the DPRK's rain falls between June and September, leaving the country vulnerable to droughts and floods, worsened by inadequate infrastructure and deforestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

At its founding, the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) inherited an advanced industrialized society from the Japanese occupation government, despite World War II damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. North Korea held 72% of the peninsula's industrial capacity and over 90% of its hydroelectric capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The WPK seized much of this, along with land from Korean landlords and Japanese colonialists, redistributing it to the peasantry between 1945 and 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. While this could have unlocked agricultural potential, the Korean War (1950-1953) ravaged the peninsula, causing population upheaval and annihilating industrial infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Post-War Collectivization and Early Challenges

After the war, the DPRK sought aid and guidance from China and the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, leveraging their deteriorating relations for maximum concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Domestically, North Korea patterned its economy after the Soviet Union, creating a centrally planned system to suppress markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The state owned all businesses, provided all jobs, seized all land, and established cooperative and state farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Farmers could only work on these state-controlled farms, with all food grown confiscated for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

Eternal leader Kim Il-sung pushed for this [[impact_of_collectivization_on_soviet_agriculture | collectivization]] to achieve food self-reliance, aligning with the country's official ideology of political independence and self-reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This move also increased North Korea's distance from the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. However, the collectivization drive, criticized even by communist bloc peers, led to food shortages in the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. In response, the government heavily promoted the use of fertilizers, pesticides, tractors, and irrigation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. While yields stabilized, the agricultural sector became dangerously dependent on raw inputs like oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## The Great Famine of the 1990s

North Korea accumulated vast debts to its benefactors, the Soviet Union and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Unpaid debts led to the Soviets withdrawing subsidies in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. That same year, the DPRK instituted a range of new [[North Korean economic and agricultural reforms | agricultural reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. They intensified double cropping, increased fertilizer use, raised forests, reclaimed tidal land, and cleared hillsides to expand arable land and compensate for lost Soviet aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. However, these intense practices led to soil depletion and acidification, with newly cleared land being marginal at best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Food production still fell short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

The collapse of the Soviet Union caused North Korea to lose its primary source of coal, oil, and steel, accounting for two-thirds of its two-way trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The loss of oil particularly hampered fertilizer production and irrigation infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The DPRK then turned to China, which by 1993 provided 77% of its fuel and 68% of its food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. However, in 1994, China faced its own grain issues and cut back on trade, leading North Korea to criticize Chinese traders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

By 1993, some provinces were already experiencing famine conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Rations were delayed or suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, and in 1994, the government triaged, ending food shipments to four provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. By 1995, coercive grain seizures from farms began, and prison camps were established for those caught foraging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Refugees pouring into China brought horrific media reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

In 1995 and 1996, the four western provinces, home to most of the farms, experienced severe flooding, collapsing terraces and silting fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The North Korean government claimed 5 million displaced people, over 1 million tons of grain lost, and $15 billion in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. While the floods were severe, the government likely exaggerated the damage to save face and request [[Role of international aid and markets in North Koreas food security | aid from South Korea or Japan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. [[Role of international aid and markets in North Koreas food security | International food aid]] did help, but not all of it reached those most in need, leading many charitable organizations to withdraw due to accountability issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The famine's exact start, end, and death toll remain uncertain, with estimates ranging from 220,000 to 3.5 million deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Post-Famine Reforms and Ongoing [[Challenges in North Korean agricultural practices | Challenges]]

Agricultural production has improved since the 1990s due to a combination of [[Role of international aid and markets in North Koreas food security | international aid]], favorable weather, and [[North Korean economic and agricultural reforms | economic reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Much current information comes from [[Role of international aid and markets in North Koreas food security | international aid programs]] operating since 2011, though subject to North Korean interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

After the famine, the government permitted households to own and cultivate private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. These small gardens, used for potatoes, corn, and vegetables, are well-cared for and have significantly improved food security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. In 2012, the Kim Jong-un government implemented economic policy changes to devolve more authority to lower levels, allowing collective farm workers more decision-making power, though this is not as extensive as China's agricultural reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The actual impact of these reforms on statistics remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

Despite improvements, North Korean farmers face several [[Challenges in North Korean agricultural practices | challenges]]:

*   **Deteriorating Soil Quality**: Farmers aggressively plow and till, and heavily use chemical fertilizers, leading to soil acidification, which hinders air/water absorption and nutrient uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Double Cropping**: Planting multiple crops in the same area or year (e.g., potatoes, barley) year after year degrades the land's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Lack of Organic Matter**: North Korea's soils have a reddish hue due to insufficient organic content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. In 2011, average paddy rice yield was 3.9 tons per hectare, significantly down from 8.0 tons in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Farmers are reluctant to rotate in legumes, which improve soil fertility, due to fear of not meeting government wheat production goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Inadequate Farming Technology**: Farmers lack suitable tractors and struggle to run or maintain existing technology due to energy or parts shortages, limiting efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. The inability to raise funds for purchases is a major factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Deforestation**: Decades of intensive efforts to expand arable land involve cutting trees on hillsides for terraces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. During the famine, cultivation was allowed on slopes above 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, and satellite imagery shows 1 million hectares cleared on slopes above 10 degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Without trees, heavy rain washes soil away, creating silt rivers that damage soil and exacerbate floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Floods have been more destructive since these efforts began in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Deforestation also impacts energy, as 77% of rural and 28% of urban populations rely on wood for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## Food Distribution and Government Policy

Famines can result from the collapse of food distribution networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. During the central planning era, the state collected harvests and distributed rations based on occupation and household size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. During the Great Famine, oil shortages hindered food distribution, leading to the collapse of the rationing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Ordinary North Koreans turned to illegal private markets for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>, often run by women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. After initial crackdowns, the government formalized these markets, providing housing, facilities, and security, effectively a market reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Today, defectors report that most North Koreans get food from these markets and their private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. While the government has tried to revitalize the old ration system, it largely serves the country's political and economic elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

The North Korean government's budget and resources have been vastly depleted over the years, operating with an official budget of around $3.3 billion USD (2007 figure) and a nominal 2017 GDP of $30 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Kim Jong-un views agricultural reform and revitalization as a core policy, repeatedly emphasizing improving lives through increased food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. However, his government has offered vague solutions like a "seed revolution" or continued reliance on practices like double cropping, which do not address the fundamental agricultural situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. While distribution has improved and famine is no longer a major threat, true self-sufficiency remains elusive due to decades of abuse and soil damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

The semiconductor industry faces a significant problem with counterfeit chips, which can have serious consequences, as exemplified by a 2020 F-16 ejection seat malfunction where counterfeit microchips were discovered in an essential component, the sequencer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While the exact role of these chips in that specific incident was unclear, it highlighted the substantial risk fake chips pose in critical situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Defining Counterfeit Semiconductors

A counterfeit semiconductor has a broad range of definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The Department of Defense provides two simple definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>:
1.  A previously used electronic part sold as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
2.  Unauthorized copies of an authentic electronic product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The industry's more comprehensive taxonomy defines a counterfeit semiconductor if it:
1.  Is an unauthorized copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
2.  Does not conform to the original manufacturer's design, model, or performance standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
3.  Is not produced by the original manufacturer or its authorized contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
4.  Is off-specification, already used, defective, or misleadingly labeled as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
5.  Is incorrectly marked or has wrong documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Scale of the Problem

[[Global Impact and Statistics on Counterfeit Electronics | Counterfeit semiconductors]] represent a significant illegal business, though data can be hard to track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. In 2019, the OECD estimated that the global volume of [[Global Impact and Statistics on Counterfeit Electronics | counterfeit and pirated products]] accounted for up to 3.3% of total global trade, or over $500 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

While a government [[Global Impact and Statistics on Counterfeit Electronics | counterfeit Parts database]] exists (Government-Industry Data Exchange Program, or GIDEP), victims often avoid reporting due to its non-anonymous nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. An alternative data source, the Electronic Resellers Association International (ERAI), tracks incidents reported by buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. In 2022, ERAI noted 504 reported semiconductor counterfeit cases, a sharp drop from 963 in 2021 and 957 in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

A November 2011 U.S. Congressional committee investigation into counterfeit electronic parts in the military supply chain quoted the [[Global Impact and Statistics on Counterfeit Electronics | Semiconductor Industry Association]], stating that counterfeiting cost the American semiconductor manufacturing industry over $7.5 billion a year in lost revenue and 11,000 jobs in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. In 2008, the Bureau of Industry Security identified 7,114 detected counterfeited microcircuit incidents across 387 companies within the defense industry, up from 3,400 in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

Counterfeited semiconductors span various types, from microprocessors to analog chips, memory, and radio frequency chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Their resale value ranges from as low as 11 cents to $500, with most falling into the 11 cents to $10 range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Case Study: P-8A Poseidon Incident

During the 2011 Senate panel hearing, several incidents of counterfeit semiconductors entering military supply chains were shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. One notable incident involved the P-8A Poseidon, a maritime surveillance aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. An ice detection module on the plane contained a component claiming to be a Xilinx FPGA unit, but it was a counterfeit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Boeing discovered the counterfeit when the part physically fell out of its socket after the plane took off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The module's manufacturer, BAE, had purchased 300 such FPGAs from a California company that only tested 50 of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Investigators traced the counterfeit chip back to an affiliate of an electronics manufacturer in Shenzhen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Challenges in Sourcing Older Parts

Defense Department contractors and commercial system integrators face a difficult situation because they often need to use old parts for repair and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. For example, the F-15 plane was introduced over 45 years ago, and original suppliers are no longer making those specific parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This forces companies to turn to often "shady secondhand suppliers" when original manufacturers have ceased production for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Despite the understandable situation, the U.S. government places the responsibility of detecting and filtering out these counterfeit chips on the contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The National Defense Authorization Act, signed into law in January 2013, threatens contractors with civil and criminal penalties for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. A notable case involved Vision Tech in Florida, which knowingly sold fake chips as military-grade goods, making nearly $16 million in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Recycling as a Source of Counterfeits

Recycling is one of the most common ways counterfeit chips enter the supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The process typically involves:
1.  Receiving scrap electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
2.  Cracking open casings and removing printed circuit boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
3.  Heating circuit boards over an open flame to melt solder and loosen components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
4.  Bashing boards against a hard surface to make components fall out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
5.  Removing original markings from components using various methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
6.  Sorting and reprocessing the components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
7.  Applying new coatings and markings to make them appear new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

This process subjects old and worn-out e-waste components to immense damage and stress, leading to many simply not working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Financial Incentives

Harvesting and desoldering old chips from e-waste can cost as little as 10 cents per chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. Since certain types of chips can sell for $1 to $10 each, a fake recycled chip can fetch as much as 100 times the cost of harvesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This significant profit margin, combined with massive imports of improperly managed e-waste from developed areas, fuels the counterfeit chip problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. In 2019, only 17.4% of the world's electronic waste was documented as collected and recycled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## Relabeled or Remarked Chips

Another type of counterfeit is relabeled or remarked chips, which are not what their markings claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Markings contain vital information about a chip's model, origins, and certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Changing these markings misleads users about the chip's capabilities and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This has real consequences, especially for components requiring enhanced specifications, like military chips needing hardening against radiation or temperature damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Suppliers might swap in cheaper commercial parts that appear similar but do not meet the hardening requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

Recycling and remarking combined account for about 80% of total counterfeiting incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Other Counterfeit Categories

### Foundry Overproduction
Many semiconductor companies contract overseas foundries to produce their chips, often without third-party oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Sometimes, a foundry produces more chips than contracted, potentially to claim higher yields or to resell the excess as counterfeits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This allows the foundry to profit from valuable designs without investing in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Unauthorized Clones
Unauthorized clones are similar to foundry overproduction but initiated by a third party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. These third parties clone chips to bypass expensive R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This practice is reminiscent of [[Challenges and failures in East Germanys semiconductor manufacturing | East Germany]] and the Soviet Union cloning Western chips and computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Design IP can be obtained through reverse engineering (e.g., using an electron microscope) or by illegally acquiring the chip's design IP at various stages of the design and manufacturing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. While functionally similar, cloned chips are often not as good in practice and can deviate from the original in technology and process, leading to erratic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## E-Waste Flow and Its Impact

Throughout the 2010s, most fake recycled and relabeled chips originated from China, where the majority of e-waste went <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. However, in 2017, China banned the import of 24 types of solid waste, including plastic and e-waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. While some e-waste is still smuggled into China, significant imports have been redirected to new countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. For example, Thailand saw a 5.7 times increase in e-waste imports after China's ban, from 9,312 tons in 2017 to 53,277 tons in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

## Detection and Prevention

Counterfeit chips often enter products because contractors lack documented evidence of the chip's supply chain history or fail to conduct thorough inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. There are two main types of methods for inspecting potentially counterfeit chips:
1.  **Physical Methods:** Look for defects related to the chip's physical properties, such as exterior, packaging, connections, or die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. This includes external visual inspection (EVI), X-ray, or de-lidding the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Some of these are destructive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
2.  **Electrical Methods:** Test for changes in component parameters (parametric test) or proper functioning (functional test) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. These are effective but time-consuming and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

Detecting counterfeits is nuanced; for instance, distinguishing normal physical defects from sanding procedures used to remove previous markings is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. A balance must be struck between detection and financial/time concerns, aiming for high test coverage rather than total assurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

### Designed for Counterfeit Measures
To combat recycling and remarking, fabulous designers can add features to their chip designs known as "designed for counterfeit measures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Simple measures include giving a chip a unique, non-programmable ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. More advanced anti-counterfeiting designs involve creating a unique fingerprint for the chip called a physical unclonable feature (PUF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. An Arbiter PUF, for example, uses random variables in the fabrication process to produce a circuit that generates a unique, repeatable output string when a signal (challenge) is sent through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. While these methods can be effective, counterfeits can still tamper with them, or they may be prohibitively difficult to implement due to cost or technical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Ultimately, most counterfeit chips, especially recycled ones, enter the supply chain because the opportunity and incentive are present worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Our modern world relies on functional semiconductors, and a chip that is not what it claims to be can cause serious harm in critical applications like military equipment or vehicle components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

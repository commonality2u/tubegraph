Compaq Computer Company's journey from its inception to its eventual acquisition by Hewlett-Packard is a significant chapter in the history of personal computing, marked by explosive growth, pivotal market leadership, and ultimately, a struggle to adapt to the very changes it helped unleash.

## The Rise to Prominence
Founded in 1982, Compaq experienced unprecedented growth, becoming a legendary story in the tech industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Its first-year revenue in 1982 reached $111 million, followed by an IPO in December 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. By 1984, revenue surged to $329 million (200% growth), and in its third year, 1985, it hit $504 million (53% growth), earning a spot on the Fortune 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. By 1987, Compaq achieved $1.2 billion in revenue, the fastest in history to reach that milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

A key aspect of Compaq's early [[compaqs_role_in_the_pc_clone_market | role in the PC clone market]] was leading an "insurgency" of IBM PC clone-makers against IBM, which helped unlock the PC standard for a new generation of manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Engines of Early Growth

### Product Innovation and Compatibility
Compaq's initial success was driven by a breakthrough product: the Compaq Portable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This product was both highly compatible with the original IBM PC and sufficiently differentiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While not truly a laptop, its portability in a shopping cart distinguished it from IBM's non-portable original PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. IBM didn't introduce its own portable until February 1984, over a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The Compaq Portable's cheaper price made it an attractive second computer for professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Compaq went to great lengths to ensure compatibility with IBM's business software ecosystem, including Lotus 1-2-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This required a "cleanroom" approach, where two teams re-implemented the IBM PC BIOS code, and adherence to the IBM PC's hardware, even down to the keyboard layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Speed to Market
Compaq significantly outpaced IBM in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. While IBM's cycle took 12 to 18 months, Compaq's "messy and chaotic" approach allowed them to bring products to market in just 6 to 9 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. A prime example is the iconic Deskpro 386, the first IBM PC clone with leading-edge silicon, which hit the market a full year before IBM had a similar offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Compaq also excelled at quickly stocking shelves, providing a compelling alternative to IBM's frequent stock-outs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Dealer-Centric Distribution
Unlike IBM, which sold through its own sales force and retailers, Compaq adopted a dealer-only distribution channel from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This strategy saved money by avoiding a large sales force and fostered strong dealer loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Cofounder Rod Canion's motto, "Keep the seller sold," highlighted this philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. While an early advantage, this reliance on dealers later became a "fatal weakness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Challenges and Decline
Compaq, after its initial triumphs and leading the PC clone revolt, faced new problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The "revolution turned on them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Attack of the Clones and Price Pressure
The modularity of the PC ecosystem, where components like Intel chips and Microsoft OS software were easily integrated, led to intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. After 1985, it became relatively easy for new entrants to assemble compatible PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Compaq's Deskpro 386 inspired a wave of "super-clones" from companies like Dell and Gateway, which were equally powerful but significantly cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Compaq often commanded a 67% premium over competitors like Gateway 2000 but was slow to acknowledge and respond to this price sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Compaq's North America President, Michael Swavely, maintained, "You can charge a premium price if you build the best machines," just months before his retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Lack of Self-Generated Innovation
Compaq's R&D investment in the late 1980s was only about 4% of revenues, leaving them beholden to critical partners like Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. The company also missed opportunities in emerging markets, notably the laptop market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Despite CEO Rod Canion's personal interest, market research indicated the market wasn't "that big" in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. When Toshiba released the successful T3100 in 1986, Compaq didn't introduce its own laptop until October 1988, signaling a growing difficulty in keeping up with a rapidly changing business environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Economic Downturn and Internal Disagreement
A mini-recession following the First Gulf War in 1990 led to lower company budgets and accelerated the growth of price-conscious clones, forcing Compaq to cut hardware prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. A significant divide emerged between management and stakeholders regarding Compaq's ability to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Chairman Ben Rosen, concerned about the slow pace of adaptation, clashed with CEO Rod Canion, who dismissed profit drops as "short-term perturbations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

In October 1991, Compaq reported its first quarterly loss in years and laid off 12% of its workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. This led to Canion's eventual firing by Rosen, who believed a low-end PC could be produced in three months, contrary to Canion's insistence on maintaining quality control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Eckhard Pfeiffer, head of Compaq's successful European operations, took over as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

## Pfeiffer's Turnaround and Peak
Pfeiffer, known for his drive, shifted Compaq's strategy to a volume game: making millions of low-cost PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. He launched a price war, cutting prices across all products and rapidly introducing new low-cost lines like the ProLinea desktop and Contura laptop in June 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. The cheapest 386 Compaq was 50% cheaper in 1992 than in 1991, making ProLinea desktops bestsellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

Pfeiffer also expanded distribution to large computer superstores targeting home consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. In August 1993, Compaq introduced the Presario, an all-in-one machine for the home market that became its new best-selling line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

This turnaround was remarkably fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. In 1992, Compaq sold 150% more computers, with revenues reaching $4.1 billion and profits $213 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. The growth continued, with revenues jumping to $7 billion in 1993 and profits hitting $867 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. By 1995, Compaq's sales reached $14.9 billion, leapfrogging IBM and Apple to become the world's largest PC maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

## Strategic Missteps and Acquisition Spree
Despite becoming the largest PC maker, this victory in 1995 also marked "the end of easy growth" in the home PC market, with competition intensifying from Dell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Compaq's long-standing dependence on external distributors and retailers became a liability as Dell's direct-selling model gained traction through the Internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. Adopting a direct model was difficult for Compaq without alienating its partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

Pfeiffer believed Compaq's future lay beyond mere PCs, aiming to become a global computer services company like IBM and setting a target of $50 billion by 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. This vision led to [[compaqs_acquisitions_and_strategic_decisions | a series of unfortunate acquisitions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>:
*   **Networth (1995) and Microcom (1997)**: To build a networking business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.
*   **Tandem Computer (June 1997)**: Acquired for $4 billion, specializing in fault-tolerant computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) (January 1998)**: A record $9.6 billion acquisition of the iconic minicomputer pioneer, turning Compaq into a $38 billion giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. While approved by analysts for its service businesses and technical assets (like the Alpha chip and AltaVista search engine), Pfeiffer struggled to integrate DEC's culture and capitalize on its technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

Meanwhile, Compaq's core PC business continued to deteriorate. It only started adopting Dell's direct-sales model in 1998, but it was "too little, too late" to close Dell's cost advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>. In September 1999, Dell officially surpassed Compaq as the leading PC seller in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>.

## Acquisition by Hewlett-Packard
In April 1999, Ben Rosen and the board fired Eckhard Pfeiffer, citing his focus on revenue numbers and his inability to integrate acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. Michael Capellas, a Compaq insider, was appointed CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>.

By 2000, both Compaq and Hewlett-Packard were struggling with the commoditization of the PC business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. Carly Fiorina, HP's new CEO, sought to transform HP into an information system services company, similar to how Lou Gerstner had [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | turned around IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:59">[00:28:59]</a>.

On September 3, 2001, HP announced its acquisition of Compaq in a stock swap valued at $25 billion, creating an $87 billion giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. Although the product lines were complementary and significant savings were projected, investors and competitors were largely unimpressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. [[impact_of_sun_microsystems_on_silicon_valley_and_the_tech_industry | Sun Microsystems']] President Edward Zander famously quipped, "When two sick companies combine, I'm not sure what you get" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. Michael Dell also saw it as a significant opportunity for Dell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.

The acquisition faced a bitter proxy battle led by Walter Hewlett, son of HP cofounder Bill Hewlett, but Fiorina eventually won shareholder approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. While Fiorina herself was later fired in 2005, her successor, Mark Hurd, managed to cut costs and grow the combined company to over $110 billion in revenue within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. The Compaq brand was phased out on most products soon after the acquisition but remained on some low-end computers until 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.

## Legacy
Compaq's role in challenging IBM and democratizing the PC industry is often overshadowed by the subsequent dominance of Microsoft and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. The massive commoditization of the PC industry in the late 1990s was destructive to American PC makers and manufacturing generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. Despite its struggles, Compaq's early [[rise_and_growth_of_compaq | rise and growth]] and its impact on establishing the PC clone market remain a testament to its significant, albeit sometimes forgotten, influence on the tech landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

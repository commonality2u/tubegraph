In 2023, Japan experienced a digital trade deficit of approximately 5.5 trillion yen, or $37 billion, importing significantly more software licenses, cloud services, and other digital services than it exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This deficit is growing, having doubled since 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While Japan is renowned for its iconic electronics hardware companies like Sony, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Panasonic, Canon, Sharp, and Toshiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, it notably lacks a software giant akin to Microsoft, Oracle, Adobe, or SAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This phenomenon can be significantly attributed to the pervasive and complex impact of IBM on Japan's technology landscape.

## IBM's Early Presence and MITI's Opposition

Throughout the 20th century, MITI (Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry) actively sought to develop Japan's computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Their primary competitor and "bogeyman" was IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. IBM first entered Japan in 1925, selling tabulating machines through a local trading company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. In 1937, it established its own subsidiary, IBM Japan, though its assets were confiscated during [[impact_of_world_war_ii_on_japanese_economy | World War II]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Upon IBM's return to Japan in 1949, the Japanese government enacted a law in 1950 mandating that all foreign computer companies enter into joint ventures with local companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. These joint ventures were effectively forced technology transfers, as seen with RCA and Hitachi, GE and Toshiba, and Honeywell and NEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, IBM famously refused to comply, maintaining 100% ownership of IBM Japan despite government demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

MITI and IBM Japan frequently clashed over which products could be introduced to the Japanese market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Even when IBM's computers were permitted, government officials actively encouraged customers to buy local products and used import licenses to enforce this policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Despite these pressures, Japanese customers consistently favored IBM products due to their "clear technical superiority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## The System/360 and Japan's Software Response

In 1964, IBM's introduction of the breakthrough System/360 line of computers further alarmed MITI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This led MITI to sponsor the Super High-Performance Computer Project (1966-1971), aimed at surpassing the System/360 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Crucially, the System/360's key selling point was its software compatibility across all models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This meant software, previously an afterthought for MITI, could no longer be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

To address this, MITI sponsored the Japan Software Company in October 1966, a joint venture involving Hitachi, NEC, Fujitsu, and the Industrial Bank of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Its ambitious goal was to create a "common language" software and universal operating system for all Japanese computers to beat the System/360 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. However, MITI only allocated 25% of the project's 10 billion yen budget to Japan Software, indicating its continued secondary focus on software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The Japan Software Company ultimately failed and closed in 1972, due to ballooning requirements, lack of external sales, and loss of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## IBM's Unbundling and "Little IBMs"

In 1969, facing an American anti-trust lawsuit, IBM made the landmark decision to "unbundle" its software and hardware, pricing them separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Previously, software was included as part of an overall computing services bundle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This unbundling was a major milestone, allowing smaller software companies to compete against giants like IBM and fostering the birth of the software industry in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

In Japan, however, the impact was different. IBM's unbundling allowed Japanese computer-makers to establish software subsidiaries and "adopt" IBM's specifications through reverse-engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. By 1971, Fujitsu was already selling "IBM-compatible" mainframes that were faster and cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This compatibility was refined with the help of Gene Amdahl, former chief architect of the System/360 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Japanese companies rarely used IBM software as-is. They modified it to display Japanese kanji symbols, with each company developing its own approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Furthermore, software was often customized to customers' existing business practices, which helped lock in customers and allowed companies to charge more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This strategy effectively turned Japanese computer companies into "little IBMs," a necessary survival tactic against IBM's persistent technological lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## The IBM Spy Case and Its Aftermath

The widespread use of reverse-engineered IBM software by Japanese companies was, however, illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. For over a decade, IBM largely refrained from acting due to factors such as the lack of definitive copyright protections for software until the Copyright Act of 1976 (enacted 1978), and its focus on a massive anti-trust case in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

Once the US government's anti-trust case against IBM ended in 1982, IBM turned its attention to the ongoing theft of its software by Japanese companies like Fujitsu and Hitachi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Japanese firms argued that the System/360 OS was in the public domain, allowing them to use derived software, and that IBM's specifications were a standard not subject to copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

The situation escalated into the "IBM Spy Case" in 1982. The US government, at IBM's behest, arrested 18 Japanese employees, some senior, from Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric in a sting operation, charging them with stealing IBM's technical secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This case generated significant animosity between the US and Japan, with the US feeling insecure about its global competitiveness and Japan believing it was being undermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Ultimately, Japanese computer firms were found to have copied IBM's work, even its errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Fujitsu settled, paying a one-time lump sum plus annual licensing fees as high as $60 million, and agreed to respect IBM's intellectual property rights going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. These significant software fees severely threatened the Japanese computer-makers' competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

MITI attempted to intervene by proposing to amend copyright laws to limit software protections from 50 years to just 15 years, a proposal that ultimately failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This period underscored the "[[japans_digital_trade_deficit_and_software_imports | Japanese software crisis]]," as companies had built their businesses on closed-source foreign software, leading to a long-term dependency on imports from companies like IBM or Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Lingering Effects and the PC Market

The "little IBMs" approach, while allowing Japanese hardware makers to survive for a time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, meant they lagged in creating independent software. This dependency on foreign software, largely influenced by IBM's early dominance and subsequent unbundling, was a key factor in Japan's [[the_history_of_japans_computer_and_software_industry | inability to develop a robust domestic software industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

The impact was also evident in the personal computer market. For over a decade, NEC dominated the domestic PC market with its PC-98, which featured hardware-accelerated MS-DOS for Japanese language support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. However, in the early 1990s, IBM, Microsoft, and Intel collaboratively broke NEC's monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. A new version of DOS with native Japanese language support opened the door for foreign software and hardware, cementing Microsoft's dominance in the Japanese market and preventing any domestic Japanese software maker from mounting a credible challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

Ultimately, the complex relationship with IBM – from initial resistance and forced joint ventures to the adoption of IBM specifications and the "Spy Case" – profoundly shaped Japan's technology landscape. It led to a strong hardware industry but a [[cultural_and_economic_factors_affecting_japans_software_development | software industry]] dependent on custom solutions and imports, rather than fostering independent, globally competitive software enterprises. Japan's software landscape remains dominated by custom-made packages with limited sales potential or imported products made abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

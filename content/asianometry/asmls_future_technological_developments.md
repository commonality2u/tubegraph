[[asmls_rise_in_the_lithography_industry | ASML]] is at the forefront of semiconductor manufacturing, with its extreme ultraviolet ([[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]]) lithography machines being critical for creating nanometer-wide patterns on chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While current [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV lithography]] is functional, [[asmls_rise_in_the_lithography_industry | ASML]] is already developing the next generation: High-NA [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV lithography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This technology aims to address existing commercial challenges and push the boundaries of chip manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

## Current EUV Challenges and the Need for High-NA

Despite its impressiveness, current [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] technology faces substantial commercial challenges, primarily concerning throughput – the number of wafers a single machine can produce over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

*   **Throughput Limitations**
    *   TSMC's leading-edge N5 process uses about 14 to 15 [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:40">[01:21:40]</a>.
    *   [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] machines are slower than older machines, necessitating more machines to maintain wafer output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>.
    *   By the second half of 2020, TSMC acquired 50% of the installed base of [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:15">[01:39:15]</a>.
    *   The estimated cost of an N5 wafer is around $17,000, which is an 80% price jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:62">[01:52:62]</a>. Reducing this cost requires faster throughput <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:83">[02:00:83]</a>.
    *   TSMC's N3 node uses even more slow [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] layers, about 20 to 25, risking further declines in throughput and hindering economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:92">[02:22:92]</a>.
*   **Multiple Patterning**
    *   For N3, TSMC may need to resort to multiple patterning, which involves using another exposure to improve feature density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:26">[02:30:26]</a>.
    *   This technique can double or triple the time to process a single layer, making the already slow [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] decidedly uneconomical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:99">[03:25:99]</a>.
    *   While more $150 million [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] machines could be bought, [[asmls_rise_in_the_lithography_industry | ASML]] is already selling them as fast as they can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:90">[03:36:90]</a>.

## High-NA EUV: The Next Generation

High-NA [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] aims to perform [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology | lithography]] better and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:33">[03:42:33]</a>. The "NA" stands for numerical aperture, a dimensionless number measuring how much light an optical system can collect and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:69">[03:56:69]</a>.

### Technical Principles

According to Rayleigh's formula (Resolution = k1 × light wavelength / NA), improving resolution involves shrinking k1, reducing wavelength, or increasing NA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:74">[04:05:74]</a>.

*   **k1:** Is close to its physical limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:64">[04:19:64]</a>.
*   **Wavelength:** The first generation of [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] already brought the light wavelength down to 13.5 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:82">[04:27:82]</a>.
*   **NA:** The remaining major factor is to raise the NA by re-engineering the optics to collect and focus more [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:58">[04:42:58]</a>.

### Performance Improvements

[[asmls_rise_in_the_lithography_industry | ASML]]'s most advanced current [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] machine, the NXE 3600D, has an NA of 0.33, translating to a 26 nanometer pitch, which meets TSMC's N5 process requirements (28 nanometer pitch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:80">[05:04:80]</a>. This machine can produce about 160 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:58">[05:06:58]</a>.

[[asmls_rise_in_the_lithography_industry | ASML]]'s first High-NA [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] machine, the EXE 5000, will increase the NA from 0.33 to 0.55 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:22">[05:18:22]</a>.

*   **Pitch:** This higher NA translates to a 16 nanometer pitch, a 67% improvement, making it the preferred method for the N3 process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:07">[05:27:07]</a>.
*   **Resolution and Defects:** High-NA [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] can print at a much higher resolution, resulting in fewer defects and more good wafers per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:83">[05:44:83]</a>.
*   **Multi-patterning Replacement:** If High-NA [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] performs as advertised, it can replace layers previously done with multi-patterning, saving significant time by reducing multiple passes to just one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:71">[05:59:71]</a>.

## Engineering Challenges

The development of High-NA [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] involves two major engineering challenges: optics and resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:97">[06:10:97]</a>.

### Optics

The optics system for High-NA [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] is developed by Carl Zeiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:79">[06:18:79]</a>. The Starlit 5000 optics system must be redesigned to allow light at more angles to hit the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:13">[06:52:13]</a>.

*   **Mirror Design (M5 & M6):**
    *   Old systems with 0.33 NA had a thinner light cone at Mirror 6 (M6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:49">[06:56:49]</a>. Increasing to 0.55 NA means making this cone thicker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:21">[07:06:21]</a>.
    *   Because multi-layer mirrors reflect [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] light at specific angles (around 13 degrees), Mirror 5 (M5) must be positioned very close to the M6 light cone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:98">[07:28:98]</a>.
    *   This setup causes interference between the two light cones, leading to significant imaging errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:69">[07:56:69]</a>.
    *   Zeiss addressed this by drilling oval-shaped holes into the mirrors, called "obscurations," which reduce angular spread and significantly increase light transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:85">[08:16:85]</a>.
*   **Mask/Reticle Redesign:**
    *   The mask, which contains the chip design pattern, cannot change in size due to redesign costs (millions of dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:55">[08:42:55]</a>.
    *   Achieving a high NA at the wafer stage requires a high NA at the mask stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:50">[08:53:50]</a>.
    *   The Twinscan NXE 30300B has a 0.33 NA and a magnification factor of 4x, projecting a 132mm x 104mm reticle area onto a 33mm x 26mm wafer area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:49">[09:23:49]</a>.
    *   Increasing the NA causes the two light cones to overlap by one degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:37">[09:37:37]</a>.
    *   Raising the [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] light reflection angle (e.g., from 6 to 9 degrees) is not feasible as it creates mask shadowing effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:75">[09:51:75]</a>.
    *   The solution involved raising the magnification factor from 4x to 8x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:79">[10:11:79]</a>. While this avoided fatter cones and mask shadows, it shrunk the wafer area to a quarter of its original size (16.5mm by 13mm), which was economically unacceptable for customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:89">[10:32:89]</a>.
*   **Anamorphic Imaging:**
    *   To compensate, Zeiss and [[asmls_rise_in_the_lithography_industry | ASML]] utilized anamorphic imaging, a technology borrowed from the movie industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:96">[11:45:96]</a>.
    *   This allows different magnification factors for the x and y axes. They only needed the 8x magnification along the y-axis, not the x-axis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:91">[11:28:91]</a>.
    *   This new optics technology projects a 16.5mm by 26mm field, which is half the size but "just barely acceptable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:53">[11:38:53]</a>.

### Resist

The photoresist is applied to the substrate before [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:35">[0:12:15]</a>. A higher NA requires a thinner resist to lower the risk of pattern or line collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:43">[0:12:29]</a>.

*   If the resist is too thick, lines after [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] exposure will be too close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:47">[12:37:47]</a>.
*   During drying, if lines don't dry simultaneously, surface tension can distort the design or cause lines to fall over or peel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:92">[12:56:92]</a>.
*   The goal is a resist layer at least 50% thicker than the pitch, meaning a 20 nanometer thick resist for a 16 nanometer pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:44">[13:07:44]</a>.
*   [[asmls_rise_in_the_lithography_industry | ASML]] is working with various [[asmls_partnerships_and_collaborations | partners]] like Imec, PSI, and CXRO to find a suitable resist candidate, which is still in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:20">[13:19:20]</a>.

### Other Engineering Challenges

Additional challenges include:
*   Making bigger mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:21">[13:25:21]</a>.
*   Mask frame layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:30">[13:26:30]</a>.
*   Pellicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:85">[13:27:85]</a>.
*   Metrology system: Crucial for checking progress and [[asmls_quality_control_and_supply_chain_management | quality]] of lines on the wafer, especially for structures less than 20 nanometers wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:96">[13:41:96]</a>. [[asmls_rise_in_the_lithography_industry | ASML]] is exploring e-beam inspection techniques, but this remains to be finalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:47">[13:48:47]</a>.

## Development Status and Cost

The High-NA [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] machine is still in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:81">[14:00:81]</a>.

*   The first EXE 5000 machines are expected to be delivered to customers in late 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:46">[14:05:46]</a>.
*   An improved version, the EXE 5200, is expected in 2024 or 2025, with an anticipated throughput of 220 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:41">[14:18:41]</a>.
*   The entire EXE 5000 machine will be massive, comparable in size to a crouched T-Rex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:39">[14:31:39]</a>.
*   Each machine will carry a price tag topping $300 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:99">[14:36:99]</a>.

The EXE 5000 represents an engineering marvel that will need to justify its monstrous price through enhanced performance and economic benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:59">[14:56:59]</a>.

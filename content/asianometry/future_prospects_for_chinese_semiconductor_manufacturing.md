Recent news indicates that China's semiconductor National Champion, SMIC, has begun producing chips using its proprietary 7-nanometer process node, referred to as "N+2" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This development represents a significant step in [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's semiconductor manufacturing efforts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

## SMIC's 7-nanometer N+2 Node
The N+2 node is a descendant of SMIC's N+1 process, which was first taped out in October 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Both nodes utilize DUV immersion lithography with multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. While the N+2 node is capable of using EUV technology, an export ban by the United States has blocked SMIC's acquisition of EUV devices from ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

TechInsights and SemiAnalysis note that SMIC's N+2 process is "99% the same" as TSMC's N7 node, particularly in the physical measurements and placement of transistors (finfets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. TSMC first shipped N7 chips in high volume in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, which means SMIC's high-volume N7 equivalent node places them approximately four to six years behind the global leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Economic Competitiveness and Yield
While N+2 is one of the most advanced processes available from any foundry to its customers, its economic competitiveness without EUV is a key consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. It is technically possible to fabricate chips at nodes even more advanced than N7 using 193 nanometer immersion technology and multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Dr. Burn Lin, the "father of 193 nanometer immersion lithography," stated in 2022 that SMIC could even fabricate N5 equivalent chips using only multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

The primary [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenge in semiconductor manufacturing]] is not just making a few wafers, but achieving meaningful yieldsâ€”where chips can be used and perform to specification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Given the similarity between SMIC's N+2 and TSMC's N7, it is anticipated that N+2 will follow a similar yield optimization curve as TSMC's successful N7 ramp-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

However, an N7 equivalent node relying solely on multi-patterning without EUV faces manufacturing limitations that impose serious design restrictions on chip designers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. In an open market, N+2 would likely not be economically viable due to better-performing EUV-equipped alternatives like TSMC's N6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Impact of Trade Secrets and Export Controls
The N+2 node's close resemblance to TSMC's N7 could lead to intellectual property disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. In the past (2002 and 2006), TSMC successfully pursued product import bans on SMIC products in the United States that were found to be made with TSMC trade secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. If similar legal action were successful again, it would severely limit N+2's viability as an export product, restricting its use primarily to domestic Chinese products or exports to friendly countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

While SMIC values export capability to countries like the United States, they likely no longer depend on it as heavily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Role of Domestic Demand and Partnerships
The Chinese chip design industry has significantly advanced since the mid-2000s, with a more sophisticated electronics industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. HiSilicon, Huawei's chip design arm and formerly China's largest semiconductor company, is a strong candidate to utilize N+2 for high-performing mobile processors for their popular phones and server chips for cloud services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. HiSilicon was a flagship customer of TSMC, fabricating chips like the Kirin 980, 985, and 990 series on N7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

A partnership between HiSilicon and SMIC would be significant, as foundries rely on massive production volumes to scale and yield-optimize their process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. If they can achieve high volumes, N+2 is expected to improve over time, similar to how TSMC optimized its N7 node before EUV arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### SMIC's Strategic Push
[[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China has prioritized leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing]] since the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. A key factor in SMIC's recent advancements is Co-CEO Liang Bong Song, a TSMC alumnus known for his technical brilliance and relentless pursuit of the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Upon joining SMIC in 2017 from Samsung, Liang brought his 200-person R&D team and reoriented the company from a second-source manufacturer to a leading-edge focused entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. As long as Liang remains at SMIC, the company is expected to continue pushing towards the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## Export Controls and Domestic Alternatives
Access to the latest lithography technologies is crucial for SMIC's long-term goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The United States government has pushed the Netherlands (ASML) and Japan (Nikon) to prevent the export of their immersion DUV lithography machines to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This timing likely correlates with the N+2 shipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. While EUV export has long been blocked, expanding the ban to immersion lithography is a significant escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

Immersion machines, which use fluids to improve resolution, are workhorses of modern semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Currently, ASML and Nikon are the only two suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Converting older dry 193 nanometer ARF machines into immersion lithography machines is technically possible, though it requires substantial effort and expertise, potentially taking less than five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:10:00]</a>. An N7 equivalent node would require more sophisticated immersion technologies, extending this timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### [[implications_of_chinese_semiconductor_advancements | Implications of Chinese Semiconductor Advancements]]
An export ban on 193 nanometer immersion lithography technology, without a corresponding ban on dry ARF technology, is estimated to add four to six years to SMIC's march towards the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. However, such a ban is also likely to stimulate substantial investment in Chinese-made lithography equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This would likely focus first on maintaining existing immersion equipment and second on facilitating the dry-to-immersion transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Whether Chinese companies can ever ship a complete lithography system on par with ASML or Nikon is debatable, with the current gap estimated to be several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. However, nothing is insurmountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Achieving a legitimate 7-nanometer node at high volume and good yield is a triumph for [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's advanced manufacturing industry]], as only three other companies have reached this level of scale and sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

While a successful immersion ban would not be a permanently damaging blow, it could maintain and slightly expand the Sino-American semiconductor gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This buys time for other nations, similar to the American response to the Japanese semiconductor challenge over 30 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. During that time, the American industry built new markets, improved manufacturing, and adopted innovative suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

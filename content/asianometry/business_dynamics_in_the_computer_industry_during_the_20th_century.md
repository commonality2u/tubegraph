The 20th century saw the rapid evolution of the computer industry, from government-secret projects to a burgeoning commercial market. This journey was marked by intense competition, shifting business models, and the constant push for technological advancement, often driven by singular visions.

## Early Days: Government Influence and Private Enterprise

The foundational period of computing was heavily influenced by government and military needs. During World War II, the US Navy employed an elite team of code-breakers known as the Communications Supplementary Activity - Washington (CSAW) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>. This secret division designed powerful machines to decrypt Axis naval codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Post-war, as the need to break Soviet codes persisted but budget cuts loomed, the Navy partnered with investment banker John Parker to establish Engineering Research Associates (ERA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. ERA, operating largely in secret from an old glider factory, initially focused on code-breaking machines before transitioning to general-purpose computers leveraging technologies like magnetic drum memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:05">[02:02:05]</a>. The ERA 1101, for instance, was a commercialized version of a device sold to a precursor of the NSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:19">[02:19:19]</a>. By the 1950s, Minnesota, due to its strong military presence, emerged as America's premier computing center, predating Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

### Mergers and Conflicts

In December 1951, ERA's original investor, John Parker, controversially sold the company to Remington Rand, a company primarily known for typewriters and shavers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. This move angered key ERA workers like William Norris, who was then VP of Operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. Adding to the complexity, Remington Rand had already acquired another prominent computer company: Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data=t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>, creators of ENIAC and UNIVAC I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

Initially, a division of labor was established: Eckert–Mauchly would focus on the business computer market, while ERA would concentrate on scientific computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. This distinction was crucial, as early business computers performed simple operations at large scale, while scientific computers required complex, highly accurate calculations, albeit for single, intensive problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

Tensions flared between the two groups. The "farmers" from Minnesota (ERA) were looked down upon by the Philadelphians (Eckert–Mauchly), who in turn were seen as theoreticians prioritizing speed over reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. The situation worsened in 1955 when Rand merged with Sperry Corporation to form Sperry Rand, forcing the units into a single Univac division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. Sperry's management believed they were acquiring a market leader, but UNIVAC lacked the necessary capital for research and development and to finance the equipment leasing business model prevalent at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

## The Birth of Control Data Corporation (CDC)

Frustrated with Sperry Rand, William Norris departed in 1957 to found Control Data Corporation (CDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. He invited several ERA colleagues, including the talented computer designer Seymour Cray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. CDC began with a vague idea to make computers, some money from friends, and no plant or product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. To raise capital, CDC literally sold shares on the street for a dollar each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. Prominent investors, including Warren Buffett (Norris's nephew by marriage), declined due to skepticism about competing with IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. Despite initial doubts, these early shares later soared in value, creating significant wealth in Minnesota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

Seymour Cray, CDC's most technical person, convinced co-founders to target scientific computers over the commercial market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. His reasoning was that universities and nuclear weapons labs, their primary clientele, were less concerned with marketing and client service, programmed their own software, and above all, demanded "serious compute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. This niche demand, especially for simulating complex phenomena like nuclear detonations, implied an "infinite need for compute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

## Competition and Innovation in Supercomputing

Cray believed he could build such a computer cost-effectively using transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. He famously used rejected bipolar radio transistors, pairing them in "Darlington pairs" to amplify their weak signals, demonstrating that clever design could compensate for substandard components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

In 1958, Norris secured a deal with the US Navy for what would become the CDC 1604 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. Launched in 1960, the CDC 1604 cost $990,000 (about $10.4 million today) and, at 0.2 megahertz, became the most powerful commercially available computer of its time—a supercomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.

The term "supercomputer" refers to machines that push the envelope in computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. While UNIVAC (with the LARC) and IBM (with the STRETCH) also produced powerful machines, these were largely "made-to-order" products, with UNIVAC selling only two LARC units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. Control Data, however, commercialized the supercomputer, selling the 1604 to various customers including the University of Illinois, Lockheed, and the State of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. This success allowed CDC to turn a profit and challenge established giants like Rand and IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

### CDC's Diversified Business Strategy

Following the 1604, CDC's management debated strategy: either attack the lucrative business data processing market or continue focusing on scientific machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. Cray threatened to leave if he couldn't pursue his goal of building the fastest possible machine to meet the demand for complex computational modeling like Finite Element Analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. Ultimately, Norris agreed to split the teams, allowing Cray to open a separate lab in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, to develop the CDC 6600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>.

The CDC 6600, delivered in 1964, shocked IBM by being three times faster than their 7030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>. IBM's chairman, Thomas J. Watson Jr., questioned how a small team could surpass the world's biggest technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>; the answer lay in Cray's willingness to sacrifice compatibility for speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>.

Despite Cray's successes, management continued to expand CDC's business. The company began making its own peripherals and software, pursuing a [[vertical_integration_in_the_tech_industry | vertical integration]] strategy to build a services business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:00">[17:19:00]</a>. CDC even purchased a consumer finance company, Commercial Credit, to fund its computer leasing strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>, a move that eventually backfired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>. Over 100 CDC 6600s were sold, each costing $8 million (about $23 million today), limiting the market to only about 50 total customers worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>. CDC's management increasingly believed that peripherals and services, not just hardware, were the company's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>.

The CDC 7600 followed, hailed as the world's fastest computer, but its frequent breakdowns and a weak economy led to poor sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>. Seymour Cray's next project, the 8600, ran into severe cooling issues due to extremely dense component packing, leading him to want to "throw everything out and start again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:41:00">[18:41:00]</a>. This "Cray way" of starting from scratch clashed with CDC's financial constraints, especially during an expensive antitrust lawsuit against IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10:00">[19:10:00]</a>. Unable to secure the necessary funding for a complete redesign, Cray left CDC in 1972 to start his own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>.

## Cray Research: A Niche Business Model

Seymour Cray founded Cray Research with $2.5 million, aiming to build supercomputers "one at a time like a master artisan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:44:00">[19:44:00]</a>. The focus was on research, not mass manufacture, pushing the "outer limits of possibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:03:00">[20:03:00]</a>. In a show of goodwill, William Norris and Control Data invested a quarter million dollars in the new venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>.

Cray Research's first machine, the Cray-1, released in 1976, made a huge stir with its iconic circular design, liquid cooling, and world-beating speed, introducing vector processing to overcome performance bottlenecks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:22:00">[22:22:00]</a>. It sold about 100 units to government and university labs, generating significant revenue growth for Cray Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>. IBM did not even attempt to compete, and Control Data, Cray's former employer, struggled to keep up with its more bloated and complicated vector computers, eventually suffering large financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:54:00">[23:54:00]</a>. By the mid-1980s, CDC's most profitable business was Ticketron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>.

### Growth and Operational Challenges

Cray Research's success led to rapid growth, from 300 to 500 employees between 1978 and 1980, and peaking at over 5,000 employees in Chippewa Falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:24:00">[25:24:00]</a>. However, this growth brought new responsibilities for Seymour Cray, diverting his focus from pure design to business operations, especially after the company's IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>.

## Evolving Market Landscape and Internal Pressures

Customer demands began to shift. While Cray initially focused on scientific computing because users wrote their own software, customers increasingly sought portability, which explained the popularity of the [[the_commercial_evolution_and_significance_of_unix_in_the_technology_industry | Unix]] operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:46:00">[25:46:00]</a>. They preferred a better Cray-1 over a radically different Cray-2 that would require them to rewrite software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:00]</a>. This echoed the dilemma Cray faced at Control Data.

Cray Research again adopted a dual approach. They extended the Cray-1 line with the 1S, while Seymour Cray stepped down as Chairman in 1981 to focus on the Cray-2 as an independent contractor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:13:00">[26:13:00]</a>.

The Cray-2, released in 1985 with its distinctive liquid immersion cooling, was unexpectedly upstaged by another Cray Research product: the Cray X-MP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:00">[26:43:00]</a>. Led by Les Davis and Steve Chen, the X-MP introduced parallel processing with four CPUs and solid-state storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:09:00">[27:09:00]</a>. Released in 1983, the X-MP became the world's fastest supercomputer without the radical design changes of the Cray-2, selling nearly 200 units compared to the Cray-2's 24 by 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:00">[27:31:00]</a>.

### Emergence of New Competitors

The 1980s saw the emergence of new supercomputer competitors. Japanese companies like Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC leveraged their growing advantages in VLSI [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics | semiconductor]] production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:02:00">[28:02:00]</a>. Although Cray still dominated with 56% market share in 1988, Japanese companies collectively held 37% and were gaining ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:18:00">[28:18:00]</a>.

Additionally, supercomputer startups like Thinking Machines and nCUBE began exploring Massively Parallel Systems (MPPs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:29:00">[28:29:00]</a>. These systems coordinated many commercial microprocessors, offering a far better price-for-performance ratio by using off-the-shelf components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:43:00">[28:43:00]</a>. This combined pressure from Japanese rivals, startups, and even Control Data's supercomputer spinoff ETA Systems forced Cray Research to focus its approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:57:00">[28:57:00]</a>.

## The Decline of "Big Iron" and Changing Dynamics

Cray Research's success with the X-MP also led to internal challenges. Steve Chen's aggressive vision for the MP line, including 64 processors and custom integrated circuits, spiraled beyond the company's financial capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:14:00">[29:14:00]</a>. Cray Research, already investing in the Cray-3 and Y-MP, scaled back Chen's MP line, leading to his departure in 1987 to start Supercomputer Systems, which later went bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:51:00">[29:51:00]</a>.

In 1989, Seymour Cray himself left Cray Research to join a spinoff, Cray Computer Corporation (CCC), in Colorado, to work on the Cray-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:09:00">[30:09:00]</a>. The Cray-3 was planned to use gallium arsenide semiconductors for extreme speed, requiring significant investment in chipmaking equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:32:00">[30:32:00]</a>. However, the project fell behind schedule, and cratering defense demand after the fall of the Soviet Union led to customer cancellations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:42:00">[30:42:00]</a>. CCC sold only one system before filing for bankruptcy in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:53:00">[30:53:00]</a>.

Seymour Cray's cherished approach of "sitting down with a clean sheet of paper" to build a "big iron" supercomputer was no longer financially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:04:00">[31:04:00]</a>. He formed a new company, SRC Computers, to explore parallel designs before his death in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:11:00">[31:11:00]</a>. Cray Research itself was eventually sold to Silicon Graphics and, after bouncing around, became Cray Inc., now part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:24:00">[31:24:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The business dynamics of the 20th-century computer industry highlight a continuous tension between radical innovation and commercial viability. While single-minded pursuits like Seymour Cray's led to groundbreaking machines, corporate pressures for broader market appeal, cost efficiency, and adaptability to evolving customer needs often dictated long-term success. The industry transitioned from specialized, high-cost "big iron" machines to more diversified and parallel architectures, mirroring the shift from artisan-built marvels to mass-produced, commodity-driven components. Today's leading [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics | semiconductor]] makers face similar thermal, interconnect, and memory challenges, but unlike Cray's ability to "throw it all out and start anew," the complexity of modern industry makes such radical resets impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:08:00">[32:08:00]</a>.

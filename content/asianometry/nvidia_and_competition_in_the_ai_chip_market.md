The current [[the_ai_and_ai_chip_boom_landscape | AI and AI chip boom landscape]] has seen significant discussion surrounding [[key_partnerships_and_strategic_moves_of_nvidia | Nvidia]] and its competition, particularly regarding the challenges to its AI accelerator profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Nvidia's Strategy Amidst Competition

Nvidia's market position, often perceived as a "fortress," might not be as easily assailable as it initially seems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. CEO Jensen Huang is aggressively responding to competitive threats by ramping up annual updates to their accelerator lineup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This relentless pace echoes the early days of [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] during the [[competition_in_the_graphics_card_market_of_the_1990s | Graphics Cards Wars]], when [[nvidias_rise_in_the_graphics_card_industry | Nvidia]] released new products every six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

[[key_partnerships_and_strategic_moves_of_nvidia | Nvidia]] can maintain this rapid rollout speed because, as Jensen Huang indicated, they "ship before they test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. They leverage the latest computer software design and emulation tools to model and ship new GPU designs without initially fabricating a physical chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This approach aims to tape out "perfect chips" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, though it can lead to initial problems for customers with drivers and associated software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. However, [[key_partnerships_and_strategic_moves_of_nvidia | Nvidia]]'s brand can withstand such issues, unlike nascent AI chip startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This high-speed iteration, while potentially frustrating for customers who spend significant amounts on machines that are quickly superseded, remains a core strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Competition from Tech Giants

While startups pose some challenge, [[key_partnerships_and_strategic_moves_of_nvidia | Nvidia]] is more concerned about tech giants like Microsoft and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. These companies are the primary drivers of current AI investment and possess the greatest incentive to reduce reliance on [[key_partnerships_and_strategic_moves_of_nvidia | Nvidia]] by developing custom-designed chips or ASICs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Examples of Vertical Integration

*   **Google TPU**: The Google TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) is a modern example of a custom ASIC, currently in its fourth iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. It significantly contributes to Google's computational advantage over other AI labs like OpenAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Microsoft's Efforts**: Microsoft is notably aggressive in vertical integration. CEO Satya Nadella mentioned in Q2 2024 earnings call that most usage in Azure AI services stems from inference rather than training, which is more amenable to custom-designed ASICs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Microsoft is also reportedly developing a network card to transfer data between servers, further integrating their database stack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

This trend of vertical integration suggests that the scale and cost of the AI database stack are so immense that every penny counts, or alternatively, that growth in the industry might be plateauing, leading to price-based competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

For [[key_partnerships_and_strategic_moves_of_nvidia | Nvidia]], this means that while things might remain stable in the short term as other tech giants ramp up their AI chip designs (e.g., the first Google TPU was a bare-bones product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, in the medium to long term, [[key_partnerships_and_strategic_moves_of_nvidia | Nvidia]] will need to intensely focus on maintaining its performance-cost leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

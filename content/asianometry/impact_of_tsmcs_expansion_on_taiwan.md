Recent discussions in Taiwan have frequently raised the concern that America is attempting to "steal" [[TSMCs global expansion strategy | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This sentiment has grown following local elections in Taiwan and the impending startup of the [[TSMCs Arizona facility | TSMC Arizona facility]] in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## TSMC's Global Expansion and Taiwanese Concerns

[[TSMCs global expansion strategy | TSMC]] has been developing a new production facility in Arizona since its announcement in May 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The initial plan for the Arizona facility was to produce N5 chips, which are considered very advanced and represent the most advanced node [[TSMCs technological advancements | TSMC]] had attempted to bring outside of Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Initially, people in Taiwan found comfort in two aspects of the Arizona plan:
*   **Small Scale** The Arizona site was relatively small, projected to produce approximately 20,000 300-millimeter wafers per month, compared to Taiwan's four gigafabs capable of over 100,000 such wafers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Technological Lag** N5 was not expected to be the leading edge by the time the factory came online, with the presumption that N3 (the next full node step) would be operational in Taiwan by the time the Arizona factory went live in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

However, new announcements before its December tool-in ceremony changed perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>:
*   [[TSMCs technological advancements | TSMC]] would bring its N4 process to Arizona, an upgrade to the pre-existing N5 line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   [[TSMCs global expansion strategy | TSMC]] is investing an additional $28 billion over three years to open a second Arizona factory, which will be equipped with N3 technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. N3 is expected to enter high-volume production by 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   The company is also expanding into other countries, including building a specialty N28 plant in Kumamoto, Japan, and discussing plans for a plant in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

These developments represent a shift away from [[TSMCs global expansion strategy | TSMC]]'s long-standing norm, championed by leaders like Morris Chang, of keeping all, especially the most advanced, operations in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This shift is understandable given customer demand and financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Apple, a major customer accounting for 25% of [[TSMCs technological advancements | TSMC]]'s total revenue, explicitly stated its decision to source from the Arizona plant starting in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. [[TSMC]] aims to avoid the risk of customers like Apple returning to competitors such as [[Impact on TSMC and Samsung | Samsung]] or Intel, both of whom are also building massive new facilities in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. These large build-outs are supported by $50 billion in subsidies from the CHIPS Act of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Addressing the "Stealing" Claims

The claim that America is "stealing" [[TSMC]]'s manufacturing from Taiwan, causing massive economic loss, is not credibly supported by available data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### No Evidence of Technology Transfer
There is no indication that the U.S. is forcing a technology transfer from [[TSMC]] to an American company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Typically, technology transfer involves joint ventures or specific requirements for indigenous production and knowledge sharing, which are not present in [[TSMC]]'s expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. [[TSMC]] maintains outright ownership of its fabs, as it has historically, with the exception of the SSMC fab in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Scale of Investment
Based on capital expenditure, [[TSMC]] spent about $36 billion in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The second [[TSMCs Arizona facility | Arizona Fab]] investment adds approximately $28 billion over three years (or $9 billion annually) into 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This represents about 25% to 30% of the proposed annual capital expenditure, meaning the majority of the company's spending will still be in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Wafer Shipments
In 2021, [[TSMC]] produced and shipped 14.2 million 300-millimeter equivalent wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. By 2024, the [[TSMCs Arizona facility | Arizona Fab]] will produce approximately 20,000 300-millimeter equivalent wafers a month, which is less than 1/50th of current annual production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Even after planned expansion to 50,000 wafers a month in 2026, it would still require five to ten times more investment to significantly impact global production, which current subsidies do not support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Taiwan Remains Central to TSMC

[[TSMC]] continues to prioritize investments within Taiwan:
*   The company is juggling at least five other major build-outs and expansions within Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   This includes new phases for existing Taiwanese fabs, such as expansions observed in Tainan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   [[TSMC]] is working on new [[TSMCs N2 process node and new fab locations | N2]] plants in Baoshan and potentially Taichung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   Future plans for an N1 plant in the Longtan District of Southern Taoyuan City are also being discussed in Taiwanese media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   Construction for the N28 build at the Kaohsiung Fab officially began in November 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

Taiwan remains [[TSMC]]'s greatest asset, and the company has no choice but to go "all in" on Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Broader Supply Chain and Expertise
The idea that a new U.S. fab makes America self-sufficient in silicon is misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>:
*   **Chip Variety** The majority of the world's industrially important semiconductors (used in fridges, airplanes, cars) are not the leading-edge N4 and N3 chips produced in Arizona. These are typically 130-nanometer, 65-nanometer, and N28 chips, which are high in volume but low in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Other Taiwanese Foundries** Taiwan is home to other significant semiconductor foundries like UMC (third largest), Powerchip (seventh), and Vanguard (eighth), each with specialty processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Packaging and Assembly** Taiwan holds leading positions in the rest of the chip supply chain, including wafers, packaging, assembly, and testing (OSAT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. America's position in global packaging, assembly, and test capacity is notably worse than its fabrication market share (3% vs. 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Taiwan has three of the world's five largest outsourced semiconductor packaging, assembly, and testing companies: ASE Group (largest), SPIL, and Powertech Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. There is no U.S. government funding or plans for conventional packaging facilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Human Capital** The critical managers running the fabs, including thousands of difficult-to-replace personnel in R&D, operations, and supply chain management, are located in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

Billions of dollars and 50 years of industrial development have made Taiwan a leader not only in semiconductor manufacturing but also in electronics assembly and specialty plastics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This established ecosystem cannot be replicated quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The China-Taiwan scenario remains a systemic risk that cannot be easily hedged against by simply investing in other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. The status quo, which has benefited all parties, is hoped to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

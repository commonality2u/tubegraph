Each year, 1-2% of the world's hydropower capacity is lost due to [[river_silt_and_sediment_impact_on_hydropower | river silt and sediment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Silting reduces a dam's ability to store drinking water, generate power, and protect from flooding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This necessitates expensive preventive measures and interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Rivers carry two types of sediment:
*   **Coarse sediment**: Sands and gravels, typically originating from the riverbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Fine-grained sediment**: Smaller particles, about two millimeters wide, which can come from the riverbed or from clay and silt washed into the river by rains or human activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The total amount of sediment carried by rivers is measured as sediment yield, in units like tons per year per square kilometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

When a river is dammed to create a reservoir, its natural sediment transport flow is interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Sediments begin to settle within the reservoir, gradually filling it up, a situation known as reservoir sedimentation or silting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This accumulation reduces the reservoir's water storage capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The storage lost to silting is referred to as "dead storage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Consequences of Reservoir Silting
[[consequences_of_reservoir_silting | Beyond the reduction in water storage capacity]], silting leads to several other issues:
*   **Navigation obstruction**: Piled-up sediment makes it harder for boats to carry cargo and reach dam locks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Environmental hazards**: When sediment dries, it can become airborne, causing dust storms and health hazards for local residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Damage to hydropower infrastructure**:
    *   Coarse sediments erode turbine runner blades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   They abrade gate seals and spillways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   They clog intake valves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. For example, Hurricane David in 1979 blocked power intakes at the Valdezia Dam in the Dominican Republic for half a year due to 17 meters of sediment and debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

Historically, reservoirs were designed with a presumed working life, often around 100 years, after which they were expected to be lost due to siltation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. However, many dams are critical infrastructure that cannot simply be abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Managing Reservoir Siltation
[[techniques_to_manage_and_mitigate_reservoir_sedimentation | Strategies for dealing with reservoir siltation]] generally fall into three categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>:

### 1. Sediment Yield Reduction
This approach focuses on reducing the amount of sediment flowing into reservoirs at the source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The most significant cause of high sediment yields is upstream soil erosion, often caused by human activity such as deforestation and cultivation on sloping lands by poorer farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Methods to prevent soil erosion include:
*   **Reduced tillage**: Minimizing the amount of soil turnover and disturbance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Cover crops/mulch**: Protecting denuded soil with mulch cover or vegetation like vetiver grass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Terracing**: An ancient method that converts slopes into flat steps with dikes at the edges to prevent water from washing away soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

Despite hundreds of helpful methods, a major challenge is the sheer size and diverse governance of watershed areas, which can span hundreds of miles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. However, such efforts can be effective; in Australia, siltation rates significantly declined after the 1950s due to the introduction of new farming techniques and land conservation methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Another strategy is to trap eroded sediment before it reaches the main dam:
*   **Buffer reservoirs**: Creating smaller reservoirs upstream to act as sediment traps. For instance, the 39 major dams along South America's Paraná River, including the Itaipu Dam, inadvertently serve as sediment traps for the larger Yacyretá Hydropower Dam downstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Farm ponds**: On a smaller scale, an increase in farm ponds in Central Texas over the second half of the 20th century contributed to a 55% decline in sediment yield in the watershed, improving siltation rates for local reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### 2. Sediment Routing
This category involves tactics to move sediment around or through the reservoir to prevent accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

*   **Pass-through (Sluicing)**: Also known by the Chinese slogan "discharge the muddy water, impound the clean water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This requires a substantial, extended reservoir drawdown (weeks or months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Dams must be designed with outlets large enough to handle flushing, unlike some older Australian dams whose small outlets led to silting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Many large dams in China, such as the Yellow River's Sanmenxia Dam, utilize this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Sediment bypass tunnels**: These tunnels divert sediment-laden water entirely around the dam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. They are more suitable for medium-sized dams where normal pass-throughs might be less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. A key benefit is that they do not require flushing the reservoir's water levels and allow for the river's natural water flow, offering an ecological benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Switzerland developed some of the first bypass tunnels in the 1970s, and Japan followed in the late 1990s and 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### 3. Sediment Removal
Eventually, silt and sediment will accumulate, requiring removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

*   **Dry excavation**: This involves dewatering the reservoir (which can take up to a year) and then using conventional equipment to excavate the sediment slurry and truck it away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. It is an invasive and costly effort, with costs varying significantly based on specific dam circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Dredging**: This is commonly practiced to clear river bottoms for shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
    *   **Hydraulic dredging**: Sediment is mixed with water and sucked up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
    *   **Mechanical dredging**: A machine-powered clam shell or bucket digs up the sediment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
    Dredging is expensive and often reserved for large projects, and may not be fast enough to keep up with high sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. For example, in Taiwan, $160 million spent on dredging only restored 8% of the reservoir's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
*   **Underwater explosions**: Engineers have proposed and tested using underwater explosions to loosen sediment deposits, making them easier to flush or dredge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. In 2018, Taiwanese civil engineers used dynamite in the critically important Zengwun Reservoir, which supplies 40% of the area's water needs, making traditional pass-through methods unsuitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. To protect aquatic life, they used underwater speakers, black pepper powder, and an air bubble curtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Experiments showed that blasting could create large sediment craters and loosen layers of sediment for up to six months, potentially freeing up an additional 15% of reservoir capacity when combined with dredging and de-silting tunnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

### Historical Examples
Engineers have been addressing reservoir siltation since ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. The Romans, for instance, equipped the 1,700-year-old Monte Novo Dam with two outlets specifically for flushing sedimented water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. However, societies can sometimes lose the ability to maintain these systems, leading to abandoned, silted reservoirs, such as the 1,800-year-old Roman-built Harbaka Dam in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Dams, like any human-built infrastructure, require continuous effort and maintenance to remain effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

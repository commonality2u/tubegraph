From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

In the 1960s, as the Soviet economy faced stagnation and a desperate need for reform, a "crazy idea" emerged: a single nationwide computer network designed to autonomously gather and process data from all the country's factories, commanding them to produce as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This "Soviet internet," known as OGAS, was envisioned as the "nervous system for an entire nation" to usher in a new tech-led future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. However, this ambitious vision never fully materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Context: The Soviet Command Economy

For much of its history, the [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Soviet Union]] operated as a command economy, where the state owned everything and economic activity was coordinated through directives, quotas, and commands rather than a free market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Key state entities included Gosplan (State Planning Commission), Gosnab (State Commission for Materials and Equipment Supplier), and Gosbank (handles accounting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

While the command economy initially saw rapid growth and technological achievements, particularly in military and aerospace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, the central planning system frequently struggled with assigning quotas, redistributing outputs, and faced immense paperwork, distorted incentives, and frequent miscommunications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Many quotas, especially outside the military, were met only through informal networks of "pushers" or "fixers" who worked behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Attempts at reform often exacerbated the bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## The Rise of Cybernetics

After Joseph Stalin's death in 1953, [[nikita_khrushchev_and_the_promotion_of_cybernetics | Nikita Khrushchev]] became leader and initiated a series of reforms, including the normalization and adoption of cybernetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. At the 20th Congress of the Communist Party in 1956, Khrushchev praised cybernetics as "one of the major tools of the creation of a communist Society" and encouraged the development of computer science and industrial automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

Previously banned during Stalin's reign due to assertions that information was a substance of its own and analogies between neurons and electric signals, Khrushchev's reversal allowed cybernetics to flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. [[soviet_computer_development_history | Soviet cybernetics]] became a project to introduce mathematical methods to life and social sciences, imbuing it with an "aura of Truth and objectivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The Soviets, like East Germany with semiconductors, fell under a "technological spell," viewing computers as a universal method for problem-solving, particularly for the ailing economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Influence of US SAGE System

In 1958, news of the American Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system reached the [[soviet_computer_development_history | Soviet Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. SAGE was a groundbreaking air defense system that coordinated radar data to create a unified image of America's airspace, powered by what was then the largest computer ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Its development and classified capabilities greatly alarmed [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Soviet military planners]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

In response, the Soviets developed their own centralized computer networks for air defense, missile defense, and space surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The air defense network, called "System A," boasted impressive capabilities, with [[nikita_khrushchev_and_the_promotion_of_cybernetics | Khrushchev]] claiming in 1962 that its prototype could "hit a fly in outer space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This military success opened eyes to the potential of networked computers for the [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Soviet civilian population]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Anatoli Kitov's Early Proposals

One of the early pioneers of [[soviet_computer_development_history | cybernetics]] in the [[soviet_computer_development_history | Soviet Union]], Anatoli Kitov, proposed the first effort to network the nation in 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Kitov, a war hero and rocket scientist, discovered Norbert Wiener's book on cybernetics and concluded it had high potential for the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. He authored the first significant positive article about cybernetics in the Soviet Union and founded one of the country's first computing centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

In 1956, Kitov wrote a book detailing how computers could help model and regulate the [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Soviet economy]] by replacing existing tabulating machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. In January 1959, he wrote to the Communist Party Central Committee, urging [[nikita_khrushchev_and_the_promotion_of_cybernetics | Khrushchev]] to accelerate the adoption of computers for economic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This letter likely proposed uniting economic planning computer centers into a "unified State network of computing centers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. While [[nikita_khrushchev_and_the_promotion_of_cybernetics | Khrushchev]] might not have seen it, government officials supported his proposals, except for the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

Buoyed by this, Kitov sent another letter in autumn 1959, proposing large computers at local factories and government agencies, linked together as "automated systems of management" (ASUS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. His ultimate dream was a "unified automated management system" for the entire nation, both military and civilian, called an "economic automatic management system" or EASU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This system would use powerful military computers buried deep underground, accessible via terminals for civilians to send data and use processing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Kitov saw this as a way to maximize the command economy's centralization and achieve immense financial savings by replacing the [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Soviet bureaucracy's]] production tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

However, Kitov's letter also criticized leaders within the Ministry of Defense for their slow computer adoption and suggested sharing military technology with civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. This "red letter" never reached [[nikita_khrushchev_and_the_promotion_of_cybernetics | Khrushchev]] but angered the military, leading to a show trial where Kitov lost his job, Communist Party membership, and military honors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. He was not executed and continued advocating for a networked [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Soviet future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Victor Glushkov and the Emergence of OGAS

Kitov's downfall temporarily stemmed networking's tide, but the concept persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. In 1962, [[soviet_computer_development_history | Soviet cyberneticist]] Alexander Kharkevich proposed a national unified communications network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Another prominent figure was Victor Mikhailovich Glushkov, head of the Kiev Institute of Cybernetics, who sought to create the aforementioned ASUS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Glushkov even hired Kitov as a consultant for this project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

In late 1962, Glushkov wrote to [[nikita_khrushchev_and_the_promotion_of_cybernetics | Khrushchev]] about the growing technology gap with the West and advocated for accelerating [[soviet_computer_development_history | Soviet computerization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Concerned about this gap, the [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Soviet leadership]] approved research into economic reform using these automated computer networks (ASUS) in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. ASUS allowed mainframe computers to receive information about industrial processes, akin to local network factory automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Glushkov's team successfully demonstrated computer control of a steel smelting factory 300 miles away and a carbonization process 400 miles away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

However, Glushkov's ambitions extended beyond mere factory automation, leading to the emergence of OGAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

### OGAS: The All-State Automated System

OGAS, short for "All-State Automated System for the Management of the Economy," was an abbreviation for "All-State automated system for the gathering and processing of information for the accounting, planning, and governance of the national economy USSR" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

As originally conceived in the early 1960s, OGAS was highly ambitious and structured as a three-tier hierarchy:
*   **First tier**: Approximately 20,000 computer terminals and ASUS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Second tier**: 100 to 200 mid-level regional planning decision systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Third tier**: A central planner in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

Glushkov even envisioned the computerization of currencies and money flows, initially proposing a moneyless system of receipts over the network to appeal to [[nikita_khrushchev_and_the_promotion_of_cybernetics | Khrushchev's]] Marxist ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Party leaders, however, advised him to drop this idea, which he did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

### The "Nervous System" Vision

The vision behind OGAS was a single computer network that would rationally and automatically plan, optimize, and produce the country's national economy as dictated by the Party Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Each [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Soviet bureaucrat's]] work days and weeks would be planned out by the computer, providing detailed lists of duties, timetables, chains of responsibility, and even document arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

This concept was likened to a "nervous system" for the [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Soviet Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The factories and workers were the body, struggling to move due to poor information transmission with the "brain" (Soviet leadership) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. OGAS sought to connect the two, allowing the "brain" to move the body in unison, coordinating output without bureaucratic inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Such a system would be the [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | Soviet counterpoint to the Western capitalist view of a self-regulating market economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, using historical data to rationally inform forecasts and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

## [[challenges_and_obstacles_to_implementing_ogas | Challenges and Obstacles to Implementing OGAS]]

The initial version of OGAS, presented in 1964, never developed as planned for several reasons:

1.  **Cost**: The proposed three-tier system with thousands of computer centers would have taken 30 years to build and cost an estimated 160 billion rubles, or about $1.4 trillion USD in 2016 dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. This was more than the combined cost of the [[challenges_faced_in_soviet_space_program | Soviet space]] and atomic bomb programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
2.  **Technological Limitations**: While the [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Soviet military's computers]] had world-leading capabilities (e.g., nationwide computer networks with messaging switching), civilian computer technology lagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. The military was very unwilling to transfer its specialized and custom technology to civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
3.  **Bureaucratic Resistance**: Various officials objected to the idea of being replaced or having their work dictated by a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. This included Communist Party bureaucrats, Gosplan, and industrial managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Staff in the Central Statistical Administration, in particular, recognized that the "objective" collection of data would restrain their power to control information flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Glushkov's "all or nothing" approach, requiring a complete reformation of the country's management system, made it seem like a revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

The year 1964 also saw [[nikita_khrushchev_and_the_promotion_of_cybernetics | Khrushchev's]] fall from power, replaced by Leonid Brezhnev, who reversed many economic reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Despite high-level backing from figures like Premier Alexei Kosygin, Gosplan and the Central Statistical Administration rejected OGAS's utopian vision, seeking to control its resources for their own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. OGAS, to be implemented, would have to conform to the existing [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Soviet way of doing things]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

## OGAS Evolution and [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | ARPANET]] Influence

In 1969, widespread news of [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | ARPANET]], the predecessor to today's internet, surprised [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Soviet leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. This competitive factor helped move the OGAS project forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.

With the [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | ARPANET]] news, Glushkov revised OGAS's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. This new iteration envisioned OGAS as a universal information bank, accumulating and moving information between various national agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. Instead of controlling the entire economy like a nervous system, this new OGAS would only organize and control data flows, "like a system of canals controlling the flow of water running between a country's reservoirs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. He argued this would make the [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Soviet Union]] more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

At a momentous meeting on October 1, 1970, Glushkov presented his new OGAS to the Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. For a brief moment, a Soviet internet seemed possible, with several high-ranking officials speaking positively and even hardliners remaining silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. Premier Kosygin, though absent, conveyed his support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

However, the Ministry of Finance, led by Vasili Garbuzov, interceded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. Recognizing the immense political gravity of OGAS and its potential to erode his ministry's power, Garbuzov dismissed it as a "silly project" and proposed a far more conservative counter-proposal, which ultimately won over the Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. In the end, the full OGAS proposal was neither fully accepted nor rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

## Outcome and Legacy

Throughout the 1970s, several ASUS were built in individual factories, though their exact number is unclear (sources suggest between 100 and thousands) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. However, networking them proved impossible due to their haphazard construction and lack of adherence to any standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. The nationwide unified network of ASUS, as Glushkov envisioned, never came to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

The proximate cause for the failure of the Soviet internet was bureaucratic infighting, as various leaders and power centers objected to its capabilities and hijacked it for their own needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. Ultimately, Glushkov's Soviet internet could not take off because it challenged the fundamental way the [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Soviet Union]] operated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. OGAS, an invention deeply intertwined with its context, could not survive in a system that was only a couple of decades away from implosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

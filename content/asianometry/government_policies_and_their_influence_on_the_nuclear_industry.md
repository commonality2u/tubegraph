The story of nuclear power in the United Kingdom is characterized by the significant influence of government policies, which often led to questionable economic decisions and missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. As a nuclear pioneer, the British government viewed civilian nuclear power as a vital means to diversify the country's energy mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Early Development and Government Control

After successfully exploding its first atomic bomb in October 1952, becoming the third country to do so, Britain sought to harness its nuclear development knowledge for civilian benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This period was marked by optimism, with scientists believing civilian nuclear energy could revolutionize Britain's energy industry, which was heavily dependent on coal as North Sea oil and gas had yet to be discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

In 1953, Prime Minister Churchill announced the creation of a new public agency to manage all of the country's nuclear development efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. A year later, the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. At its inception, the UKAEA held monopoly control over all nuclear research and development (R&D) in the UK and served as the de facto source of nuclear information for political decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This contrasts with the United States, where private entities like General Electric and Westinghouse also participated in nuclear R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Military Influence on Reactor Design

The initial nuclear reactors in the UK, established in the late 1940s and early 1950s, were built with military needs in mind to produce military-grade plutonium and other radioactive materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. While these reactors could generate power, their economics were unfavorable for civilian use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The British military's decision to build air-cooled graphite reactors, due to safety concerns and sourcing issues with pure water for light water reactors, had [[technological_decisions_and_their_impacts_on_british_nuclear_program | far-reaching consequences]] for the civilian nuclear power industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. These designs generally had lower thermal efficiency, meaning less electricity generated for a given fuel cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Post-Suez Crisis Expansion and Economic Concerns

In 1954, the UKAEA drafted a plan to build a series of nuclear power stations, aiming for 1,700 megawatts by 1965, based on the Calder Hall design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Calder Hall was commissioned in October 1956, with Queen Elizabeth II highlighting the harnessing of atomic power for the common good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

The Suez Canal Crisis in 1956, a "diplomatic blunder and national humiliation," cast significant uncertainty on global oil supplies and Britain's access to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Spurred by public opinion, the incoming Harold Macmillan administration emphasized the need for energy independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This political environment was "perfect" for advancing nuclear power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Consequently, the UKAEA expanded their nuclear power program to 5,000-6,000 megawatts, or about 19 stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Despite concerns about economics, the British electricity industry did not oppose the plan due to overwhelming political support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

In 1957, the reorganization of the British electricity industry led to the creation of the Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB), which controlled electricity generation and the national grid in England and Wales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The CEGB began to push back against the UKAEA's nuclear rollout, pointing out nuclear's economic uncompetitiveness against cheaper coal and oil, as the effects of the Suez Crisis on oil prices did not last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Even with optimistic estimates, nuclear power cost 25-40% more than coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Pressures from the CEGB and Treasury eventually forced the government to scale down and delay the Magnox program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

[!WARNING|Magnox Program Overruns]
The post-Suez expansion was rushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Key early [[technological_decisions_and_their_impacts_on_british_nuclear_program | technical decisions]] for the Magnox rollout were made by a few individuals without much consideration for economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. As a result, the Magnox program overran its early estimates by 10-20% in cost and took 40% longer than planned, not including decommissioning, higher interest rates, and R&D costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The decision to use five different consortiums to build the power plants resulted in each station being unique, lacking standardization and missing out on economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Rising interest rates also significantly impacted these capital-intensive projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

The gas-cooled design originated from the British military, making it better for plutonium production than economic power generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. While the UKAEA argued this was a feature—selling plutonium to the military—the market for plutonium crashed, rendering this strategy ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Despite the overruns, the Magnox program did establish the UK as a nuclear energy pioneer and its stations performed well operationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## Second Generation (AGR) and Political Pressure

In April 1964, the UK government launched a second-generation nuclear program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, proposing another 5,000 megawatts of nuclear plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The CEGB was tasked with deciding between continuing with the British gas-cooled Magnox-style reactor or adopting an American light water design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The UKAEA advocated for their gas-cooled design, while the CEGB was skeptical due to past design limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

The UK government aimed to export its native reactor designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, but the international community was increasingly adopting American water-cooled designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. The new Labor government was also sensitive to military procurement decisions, having recently cancelled a British aircraft in favor of an American one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Although the CEGB was supposed to have autonomy, the government clearly had a preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

When the nuclear-skeptic CEGB director Sir Christopher Hinton retired, the CEGB's attitude towards gas-cooled reactors shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. The CEGB controversially chose a tender from Atomic Power Constructions, a financially struggling consortium that proposed a highly speculative design based on doubling the rods from the original gas-cooled design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. The UKAEA and CEGB justified this by claiming the gas-cooled Dungeness plant would produce energy 7% cheaper under "British conditions" than American designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

[!WARNING|The Flawed AGR Choice]
In May 1965, the Advanced Gas Cooled Reactor (AGR) was officially recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Power Minister Fred Lee declared it "the greatest breakthrough of all time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. However, the AGR was "flatly the wrong choice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, based on unrealistic assumptions and models stretched beyond capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. The consortium collapsed in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The "British conditions" argument relied on faulty assumptions: capital costs were underestimated, and the assumption of continuous operation (on-load refueling) for AGRs was unproven at full scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. When tried, it caused severe vibrations and fuel element breakage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

By 1967, it was clear the AGR design was not ready, presenting immense engineering challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. The higher operating temperatures needed for improved thermal efficiency led to corrosion of the fuel cladding and cracking of the graphite moderator, requiring costly re-engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. Dungeness B, the first AGR, finally started generating power in 1983, 18 years after work began, and did not reach full capacity until 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. The AGR debacle cost the country an estimated 2.1 billion pounds in 1975 currency, equivalent to about 20 billion pounds today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

These rounds of power station construction resulted in economically uncompetitive stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. The [[influence_of_military_and_heavy_industry_on_soviet_economic_policy | coal industry]], facing decline, became the nuclear industry's biggest critic, offering a dissenting voice to the UKAEA's optimistic estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>.

## Thatcher's Privatization and Nuclear's Fate

Despite the AGR failure, the oil crises of the 1970s and other events reminded the British of the need for an energy mix including nuclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. The UK government again sought new stations and eventually chose American water-cooled reactor designs over the AGR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. By this time, public faith in the nuclear industry had waned due to years of delays and broken promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

In 1979, Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government came to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. Thatcher personally supported nuclear energy, valuing its lack of greenhouse gas emissions, its role as a hedge against the coal industry, and admiring the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Initially, her administration sought to reduce [[government_intervention_in_technology_industries | government involvement in energy policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>, believing nuclear power was cheaper than other methods and would thrive under market liberalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. New build plans for pressurized water reactors began, with Sizewell B as the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.

After two terms, Thatcher aimed to privatize the £37 billion electricity supply industry, promising to secure its nuclear future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. However, the UK's 11 completed nuclear plants (9 Magnoxes, 2 AGRs) and 6 ongoing projects were not economically competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. Falling oil prices, the breaking of the coal workers' unions, and the rise of gas-fired power stations created a challenging market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. Furthermore, the aging Magnox reactors faced immense decommissioning and waste disposal costs, estimated at £600 million each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.

[!INFO|Withdrawal from Privatization]
As the government began breaking up the CEGB, it became evident that no private shareholder would take on these nuclear liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. In late 1989, the entire nuclear portfolio was withdrawn from privatization, a "national humiliation" and an admission that decades of favorable cost estimates were false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. Two new state-owned companies, Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear Limited, were created to manage the stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

Work on Sizewell B continued, but plans for three other water-cooled reactors were cancelled due to the Treasury's refusal to support them, despite Thatcher's belief in nuclear as a tool against global warming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. This largely marked the end of the indigenous nuclear power industry in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

## Later Privatization and Current Status

Over the next few years, the two state-owned companies improved AGR reactor performance and implemented new management practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. They also negotiated fixed prices for waste disposal with British Nuclear Fuels Limited, removing financial uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. As a result, their reputation and financial performance improved, leading to the eventual privatization of seven newer AGR stations into British Energy in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. The Magnoxes were hived off for future decommissioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

Despite this, British Energy later suffered financial troubles in 2002, requiring a £650 million bailout by the British government, and was eventually acquired by a French power company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

The UK's decision to stick with the gas-cooled route, perhaps overvaluing its indigenous origin, is seen as a mistake that crippled the industry for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. By contrast, France abandoned its gas-cooled designs and developed a thriving export business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>.

As of this writing, Sizewell B remains the last completed nuclear power station in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. After a long hiatus, the UK is looking to re-engage with nuclear power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. In 2010, the government announced a series of new third-generation nuclear power stations, with the Chinese state-owned enterprise China General Nuclear Power Group contributing funding and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. The first, Hinkley Point C, is slated for completion in 2027 at a cost of £25 billion, 50% higher than its original 2016 budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. The challenge for the UK's nuclear energy industry remains its structural inability to compete with gas-fired and coal plants on the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>.

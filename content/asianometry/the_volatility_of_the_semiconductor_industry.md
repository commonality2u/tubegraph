The semiconductor industry is characterized by its high volatility, with booms often following busts rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Even in normal times, conditions are unpredictable, with semiconductor shipments capable of soaring 70% one year and crashing 40% the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## The Business Cycle

Currently, the industry is navigating a significant chip shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. However, with many companies racing to build or expand their fabs, there's an anticipation of this shortage turning into a glut potentially sooner than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The dynamics of demand and supply are central to understanding these cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Demand Dynamics and Challenges

Effective planning can forecast capacity and avoid shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. For instance, Foxconn's chairman noted that large customers have proper precautionary planning, limiting the impact of recent shortages on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

However, accurate forecasting is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. End users typically do not buy microchips directly in large quantities; instead, vendors purchase chips to integrate them into consumer goods like PCs and smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. These chips have a short shelf life, with new products constantly threatening to render current iterations obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Missing an annual launch cycle, as AMD experienced in the mid-2000s, can have severe consequences for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Foundry customers frequently desire rapid production and shipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Their concern about securing stock in uncertain times can lead to "double booking" orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. TSMC Chairman Mark Liu attributed double booking as a significant reason why the current shortage might not be as severe as it appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. He cited legitimate reasons for this, including [[Impact of the pandemic on semiconductor supply chain | the pandemic]] and recent [[Global semiconductor supply chain and geopolitical tensions | China-America trade tensions]], with the latter being a larger ongoing concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

Demand is also heavily influenced by the [[Impact of macroeconomics and geopolitics on semiconductor demand | broader macro-economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Consumers buy fewer electronics when economic times are challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Historically, three downturns in the semiconductor business cycles were linked to oil shocks in 1975, 1982, and 1991, and another to the Asian Financial Crisis of 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Despite current discussions of shortages, in March 2020, the stock market was down 25%, and experts predicted a global economic collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Companies then focused on cutting expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. However, stimulus packages and money printing led to an unexpectedly rapid economic rebound in Q3 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

A 2005 study indicated that semiconductor downcycles are triggered more by surges in semiconductor inventory levels and [[global_investments_in_semiconductor_fabs | fab capacity]] (over-supply) rather than a decrease in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Supply Dynamics and Over-supply

Foundries and semiconductor companies are aware of the business cycle, but the industry's nature and economics compel them towards expansion until collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

[[Challenges in semiconductor manufacturing | Building a fab]] requires substantial capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Moore's Law observes that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Less known is Moore's Second Law, or Rock's Law, which states that the cost of semiconductor tools doubles every four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. These tools constitute 75% of a fab's total cost, driving prices upward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. For example, a leading-edge fab cost $1 billion in 2000, $3 billion in 2005, and TSMC's N5 fab cost around $17 billion in 2020, with its next-generation N3 process fab estimated at $19.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Foundries must invest billions before they can even compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

Fabs begin losing value quickly, similar to a new car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. While fab construction costs are largely fixed, the marginal cost of producing another chip is almost negligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This incentivizes foundries to produce and sell as many chips as possible to amortize their fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

Consequently, supply can exceed demand, causing prices to collapse and profits to diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Despite this, foundries are incentivized to sell every chip they can make, even if it only generates a small gross profit, to contribute to their survival costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Industry leaders like TSMC and Samsung prioritize market share over profitability, refusing to mothball capacity to prevent competitors from gaining ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Their massive economies of scale allow them to drive market prices down to their survival price, which is significantly lower than that of other industry players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

This leads to intense downcycles that eliminate lower-performing companies through bankruptcy or buyouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Supply then re-balances with demand, and the cycle resets, awaiting the next chip shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## Government Subsidies and Their Impact

There's a global trend of governments investing in fabs. China has a $20 billion semiconductor plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, President Joe Biden included $50 billion in his stimulus plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, and the EU is allocating 145 billion euro for a 2-nm cutting-edge fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

In the US, proposed legislation includes the CHIPS Act and the American Foundries Act, which would establish an R&D fund and a 20-40% tax credit for semiconductor production equipment acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The tax credit's effects are seen as short-term (3-5 years or one fab generation), while the R&D fund is expected to have longer-lasting effects, particularly in fostering public-private partnerships like the one that created EUV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

While acknowledging the value of national sovereignty and government investment in high-priority areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, there's also a strong belief that commercial ventures should be self-sustaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Subsidies, by design, create distortions, aiming to bring more manufacturing to the USA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. While 40% subsidies can achieve this, the question remains whether subsidized fabs can stand on their own without perpetual government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Continued subsidies would likely face increased scrutiny once current political pressures, like automaker chip shortages, subside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Current Global Fab Build-out and Future Concerns

Currently, there is a significant global build-out of fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Examples include:
*   TSMC's Arizona fab, which has been under development for a year and might be upscaled from its original plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   Samsung's negotiations for a major investment in its Austin fab, involving tens of billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   Smaller, second-tier foundries are also expanding or upgrading their capacity, with many press releases from companies without process nodes under 10nm announcing new sites and projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   GlobalFoundries is investing $1.4 billion in expansion and advancing its IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   SMIC is receiving $2.35 billion from the Shenzhen government for a project expected to produce 40,000 wafers a month by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

This flurry of activity represents a substantial increase in capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Once TSMC's Arizona fab is complete, it alone could produce between 25,000 to 100,000 wafer starts per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Combined with other expansions, hundreds of thousands of wafers are expected to enter the market over the next 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

It is irrational to assume this won't impact the market once peak output is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Questions arise about whether consumer demand, particularly with people returning to school and offices, can sustain such a massive increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. The US Department of Defense, for context, buys 1.9 billion semiconductors annually, while a single TSMC Arizona fab at 50,000 wafers a month could theoretically produce 3.5 billion dies in one month alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

The current global build-out is being watched with interest, and the question of how long this boom will last before the inevitable bust remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

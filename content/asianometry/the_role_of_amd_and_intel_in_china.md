Intel and AMD are leading companies in the tech community, primarily known for manufacturing and selling chips based on the x86 instruction set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. China represents a significant market for both companies; in 2020, Intel sold $20 billion worth of processors to China, while AMD sold $2.3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These figures are comparable to or higher than what these companies generate from the United States, highlighting China's massive market presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This significant market interest has led to [[chinas_involvement_in_x86_processor_development | Chinese companies]] developing their own homegrown x86 processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Understanding x86 Processors

X86 refers to a family of instruction set architectures (ISA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. A chip design company utilizes an instruction set, such as x86 or ARM, to implement and create a CPU microarchitecture, which can then lead to a family of chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. While different companies can share instruction sets, their implementations can result in radically different designs and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Intel initially developed and popularized x86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Due to various reasons, including second-source requirements and anti-competitive regulations, Intel had to license x86 to other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. AMD is the most prominent of these licensees, holding a core license that was the subject of many legal battles over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Today, most CPUs for PCs, game consoles, and servers are x86, known for handling compute-intensive tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## China's Drive for Domestic X86 Chips

China's interest in developing domestic alternatives to American technologies stems from several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>:
*   **National Security Concerns** The Edward Snowden revelations about American spying on foreign allies and competitors raised alarm bells globally, leading countries to scrutinize the implementation of American technologies in critical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Competition** The recognition of increasing competition between China and the United States has led to a desire for self-reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **National Pride and Industry Champions** China aims to cultivate homegrown "national champions" in critical industries such as high-speed rail, solar, space, and computer chips, viewing it as a matter of national and patriotic pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Trade Restrictions** The Trump administration's actions to cut off companies like Huawei from access to American technologies reinforced China's fears about relying on foreign tech, spurring the country's push for domestic solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

These factors drive China's desire for domestic x86 chips to supply its massive user base, especially if access to foreign technologies were to be cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Chinese Homegrown X86 Initiatives

Two distinct lineages of x86 homegrown chips are available in the [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | Chinese market]]: Zhaoxin and Haigong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Zhaoxin
Zhaoxin is considered the older of the two lineages, with potentially better future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. They have been releasing CPUs since 2014, marketed as domestically made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Origin**: Zhaoxin is a fabless semiconductor joint venture between the Shanghai municipal government and Via Technologies, a Taiwanese company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Via Technologies acquired its x86 architectural license through the 1999 purchases of Cyrix and Centaur Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Centaur's acquisition led to a patent battle with Intel, which concluded with a 10-year cross-license agreement in 2003, followed by a three-year grace period in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Performance**: Zhaoxin architectures are direct descendants of Centaur Technologies' work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The latest generation, Luchadore, was tested to be about four to eight years behind the latest American x86 designs in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. They generally use less power, reflecting their mobile and IoT roots, making them suitable for China's low-end needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing**: Zhaoxin initially used [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | TSMC]] for fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. For national security reasons, Zhaoxin has been attempting to switch to a mainland alternative like SMIC, which has likely caused delays and performance loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Zhaoxin has also announced intentions to enter the discrete GPU market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Haigong (THATIC)
The second Chinese x86 joint venture initiative came at the behest of AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Origin**: In 2015, AMD formed a joint venture to provide the [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | Chinese market]] with a version of its Zen 1 x86 chips that could be considered Chinese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This venture, collectively called Tianjin Hai Guang Advanced Technology Investment Co. (THATIC), was formed when AMD's stock was low, and the company carried substantial debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Structure**: AMD structured the joint venture to control its intellectual property (IP) while allowing the Chinese to claim the chips as homegrown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The two-layer structure involved:
    *   **Hai Guang Micro Electronics (HMC)**: 51% owned by AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. AMD created IP for a special x86 server chip and handed it off to HMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit Design Company (Haigong)**: AMD only owns 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Technology Transfer Process**: HMC removes sensitive elements from the chip design before passing it to Haigong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Haigong makes its changes, including designing the top-level architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The chip is then returned to HMC/AMD for approval and finalization, then sent to GlobalFoundries for fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. After fabrication, they are given to Haigong for packaging and sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Controversy and Status**: The Wall Street Journal reported on this arrangement, drawing pushback from the semiconductor community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. AMD stated they briefed the U.S. Departments of Defense and Commerce and received a green light, though the Department of Defense reportedly disagreed with the Treasury Department's ultimate approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. AMD informed the U.S. government the chips would be strictly for commercial use, but job postings in China implied they would be used in new exa-scale supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This complex system raises suspicions about inadvertent technology transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. In 2019, THATIC was placed on an entity list, and AMD agreed not to enter into any more technology transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. While THATIC still holds the original IP, AMD has moved on to selling its fourth-generation Zen 3 chips to Chinese consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## [[Future prospects for Chinese semiconductor manufacturing | Future Outlook]] for X86 in China

The [[comparison_of_chinese_and_american_x86_processors | Chinese x86 chips]] from Zhaoxin and Haigong still lag many years behind their American-made competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Intel has indicated it might open up x86 IP to foundry customers with its "Foundry 2.0" announcement, raising questions about whether [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | Chinese fabless companies]] would be allowed to create x86 chips using this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Given the importance of technology transfer to China's national catch-up strategies, Americans may view these developments with alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

However, concerns about the loss of American semiconductor leadership via x86 may be overstated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The x86 architecture is no longer as dominant as it once was, with ARM making inroads into areas traditionally controlled by x86, such as desktops and servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. In China, x86 development remains a niche industry within [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's indigenous semiconductor efforts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Any chips made in this area are primarily for domestic consumption and are unlikely to be exported due to potential litigation and lack of competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

[[the_significance_of_arm_and_riscv_in_chinas_semiconductor_industry | ARM is where it is at today]] for China, with an estimated 95% of computer chips designed in China being ARM-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. RISC-V, a new open-source instruction set, is also gaining traction, backed by major players like Alibaba Cloud and HiSilicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. As long as Intel and AMD's chips remain available on Chinese shelves, consumers are likely to prefer the more advanced foreign options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

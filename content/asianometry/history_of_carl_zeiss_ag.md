Carl Zeiss AG, a Germany-based company, is renowned for its lenses and optics systems used in some of the world's most advanced technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These "optics systems" are massive, multi-component systems vital to the multi-million dollar photolithography machines produced by ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Without Carl Zeiss's contributions, ASML would not be able to provide machines to industry giants like TSMC, Samsung, or Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The company manufactures the optic systems that enable high-energy UV light to etch wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Founding and Early Growth

Carl Zeiss AG traces its origins to 1846 when it was founded by Carl Zeiss, a German scientific instrument maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Born in Weimar, Germany, in 1816, Zeiss was one of twelve siblings in a family of artisans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. In 1846, he established a microscope workshop where he repaired university equipment, made microscopes, and sold scientific instruments like eyeglass lenses and thermometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. His workshop thrived under his meticulous care and quickly expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

A pivotal moment came in 1866 when Zeiss recruited Ernst Abbe, a brilliant 26-year-old physicist from the University of Jena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Abbe's deep understanding of light ray movement through microscope lenses enabled the company to move beyond rudimentary trial-and-error manufacturing, giving them a significant advantage over competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Diversification and Wartime Contributions

Following Carl Zeiss's death in 1888, the company continued its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Ernst Abbe took charge and initiated a series of new business lines to diversify the company's offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Zeiss expanded into measuring instruments, camera lenses, binoculars, telescopes, and other products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This diversification proved crucial, helping the company navigate the economic turbulence of the late 1800s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

By World War I, Carl Zeiss was manufacturing military optics, including binoculars, periscopes, and gun sights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. At that time, they were the world's largest camera maker, but 80% of their revenue stemmed from military products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## [[carl_zeisss_unique_ownership_structure_and_social_impact | Unique Ownership Structure]]

Carl Zeiss AG possesses a unique ownership structure. After Carl Zeiss's death, Dr. Ernst Abbe acquired sole ownership of the company from Carl's son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. He then transferred his ownership to what is now known as the Carl Zeiss Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Abbe enshrined various social reforms within the foundation's guidelines, including health insurance, pensions, profit sharing, equality in hiring decisions, overtime pay, and nine-hour workdays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

The foundation operates without owners or shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Abbe's intention was not to establish a nonprofit, but rather to ensure the company's continued existence after his passing and to allow its employees to share in its economic prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The company was directed to prioritize long-term economic success, with any excess profit invested back into the working population of Jena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This structure resembles a cooperative more than a charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

In the 1930s, the Nazi party attempted to place a representative within the foundation, but the foundation resisted, eventually reaching a compromise where board members nominally joined the Nazi party in exchange for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Post-World War II Division

At the end of World War II, the United States Army occupied Jena in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. As part of a strategy to bring leading German scientists under American control, 130 of Zeiss's top technicians and executives were quickly relocated to Oberkochen in West Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. These key individuals would later rebuild a factory and the company from memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

While initially there was hope for the company to remain unified, in 1947, the Soviet Army shipped 94% of Zeiss's Jena-based equipment and 300 employees back to the Soviet Union as war booty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This equipment later contributed to the founding of the Kiev brand of cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

This led to the separation of Carl Zeiss into two distinct entities:
*   **Zeiss in West Germany:** Initially known as Opton, it later became Zeiss Oberkochen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Zeiss in East Germany:** Often called Zeiss Jena, or VEB Carl Zeiss Jena (VEB standing for state-owned enterprise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

These two companies operated independently for decades, offering similar products and engaging in legal battles over trademark ownership overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. After 18 years, they agreed to split the world, with each side refraining from using the "Zeiss" trademark in the other's half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. West Germany's Zeiss used "Opton" in Eastern Bloc countries, while East Germany's Zeiss used "Osgena" in Western Bloc countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Despite starting with nothing, both companies flourished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Zeiss Jena, in particular, became a flagship East German company, diversifying into new areas including military technology, space technology, and [[carl_zeisss_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | semiconductors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## German Reunification and Modern Structure

With German reunification, Zeiss Jena faced significant challenges, having substantial overlap with its Western counterpart and losing the critical Soviet military market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This was a turbulent economic period, with East German industrial output falling by 51% and three million East Germans losing their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

After years of negotiations, a settlement was reached: the traditional Zeiss company parts (microscopes, medical instruments) from East Germany were acquired by the West German entity, along with the "Zeiss" name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The remaining 6,800-employee diversified firm was renamed Jenoptik and focused on [[carl_zeisss_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | semiconductors]], laser optics, and automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Jenoptik was initially at risk of collapse but was saved by government intervention, which bought 80% of its assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. In 1998, the company conducted a $400 million IPO and remains successful today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

Today, Carl Zeiss AG is a large and sprawling company with four main segments:
*   Industrial Quality and Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
*   Medical Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>
*   Consumer Markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>
*   [[carl_zeisss_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | Semiconductor Manufacturing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>

These divisions provide optical systems for a diverse range of industries, including consumer eyeglasses, cars, medical surgeries, and measuring machines/microscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Carl Zeiss heavily invests in research and development, spending 812 million euros in 2020, which accounted for 13% of its total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Carl Zeiss SMT and Semiconductor Manufacturing

The Carl Zeiss SMT division is crucial to the world's microchip production, with a large portion of chips made using Zeiss technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Carl Zeiss SMT is a [[partnership_between_carl_zeiss_and_asml | joint venture between Carl Zeiss AG]], which holds a majority share, and ASML, which holds a 24.9% stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Its core product is the optics system at the heart of the lithography scanners and steppers produced by ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) Lithography
Carl Zeiss has a long history in deep ultraviolet (DUV) imaging systems, building them for nearly 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. As early as 1874, Carl Abbe himself proposed the concept of a microscope using ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. By 1899, the company successfully developed a quartz lens suitable for UV microscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

In the 1960s, Zeiss began leveraging its microscope techniques to create the first-ever lenses for microlithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Microlithography demands extremely tight control over light distortions across a relatively large area to ensure accurate transfer of IC designs onto silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. To achieve this, Zeiss combined multiple smaller lenses into a single, massive optics system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The unique "double bulge and waist" structure of these multiple lenses helps reduce field curvature, a common optical problem that prevents an entire image from being in sharp focus simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Zeiss adapted its microscope techniques to improve the resolution for projecting IC designs onto wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. A significant breakthrough came in the 2000s with the advent of immersion lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This technique replaces the air gap between the wafer and the stepper with water, allowing ultraviolet light to pass through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. First proposed for semiconductor use by Taiwanese scientist Burn J. Lin, immersion lithography enabled foundries to etch structures as small as 40 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Today, Zeiss's leading products for this technique are the Starlith 1900 series, including the 1900i, which are among the company's best-selling products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The company invested over 450 million euros into a new factory to overcome the substantial engineering challenges in building these optics systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography
[[historical_context_and_industry_efforts_in_euv_advancement | Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography]] represents the next frontier in semiconductor fabrication, a disruptive technology used in today's cutting-edge process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. The new wavelength of EUV light requires radical changes to the optics system because all available materials, including air, absorb high-energy UV light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. This means traditional lenses are not feasible, necessitating an optical system crafted entirely from multi-layer mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

Zeiss began its work on EUV optics systems in 1995 with the initiation of a micro exposure tool, a smaller prototype for the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Collaborating with Lawrence Livermore National Lab and Berkeley Lab in California, they delivered the first prototype in 2003 and refined the design five times over the following years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. In 2015, the first full-field EUV optic system, named the Starlith 3100, was delivered to ASML for integration into their ASML ADT NXE 3100 (Alpha Demo Tool) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

The Starlith is a multi-component system comprising collector optics, aperture illumination optics, a reticle, and projection optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. EUV light from the source first hits the collector, which gathers and projects the light through an aperture into the illuminator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. The illuminator then spreads the light evenly before it reflects off the reticle, which holds the IC chip designs, and is finally projected onto the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. The 3100 model pioneered the core mechanics of the optical system, which were subsequently refined in later versions like the Starlith 3300 and 3400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Today, it is a critical component of EUV-based process nodes at 7 nanometers and below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

## Conclusion

In 2020, Carl Zeiss's [[carl_zeisss_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | semiconductor division]] generated 1.8 billion euros in revenue, growing 12% year-over-year while other divisions experienced declines due to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. It now contributes 30% of the group's business and holds significant strategic importance in German industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. The company's unique ownership structure also deeply connects it to its community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. As a critical strategic partner to ASML, Carl Zeiss is almost unparalleled in its field; competitors like Nikon and Canon, who produce their own optics systems, have not achieved the same success as the [[partnership_between_carl_zeiss_and_asml | ASML-Zeiss collaboration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. The complexity of Zeiss's DUV and EUV optics systems is immense, making it challenging for competitors to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

Germany-based Carl Zeiss AG is a company renowned for manufacturing lenses and optics systems, particularly for advanced technologies like photo lithography machines utilized by firms such as ASML, TSMC, Samsung, and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These optics systems are crucial for etching patterns as wide as a small virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Founding and Early Growth

The company that would become Carl Zeiss AG was founded in 1846 by Carl Zeiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Born in Weimar, Germany, in 1816, Zeiss was a German scientific instrument maker from a family of artisans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. In 1846, he established a microscope workshop where he repaired university equipment, made microscopes, and sold scientific instruments like eyeglass lenses and thermometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. His workshop thrived and expanded under his meticulous care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

In 1866, Zeiss recruited Ernst Abbe, a 26-year-old physicist from the University of Jena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Abbe's contributions on the movement of light rays through microscope lenses helped the company move beyond trial-and-error manufacturing, providing a competitive edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Diversification and Wartime Role

Carl Zeiss died in 1888, but the company continued its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Ernst Abbe took over, initiating new business lines for diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Zeiss expanded into measuring instruments, camera lenses, binoculars, and telescopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This diversification helped the company grow and survive the turbulence of the 1800s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

By World War I, the company was a major producer of military optics, including binoculars, periscopes, and gun sights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. At the time, they were the world's largest camera manufacturer, but 80% of their revenue derived from military products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Unique Ownership Structure: The Carl Zeiss Foundation

The company has a unique ownership structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. After Carl Zeiss's death, Dr. Ernst Abbe acquired sole ownership of the company from Carl's son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. He then transferred his ownership to what is now known as the Carl Zeiss Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Abbe embedded various social reforms into the foundation's guidelines, such as health insurance, pensions, profit sharing, equality in hiring, overtime pay, and nine-hour workdays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The foundation operates without owners or shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Abbe's intention was not to create a nonprofit, but to ensure the company's continued existence after his death and allow employees to partake in its economic success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The company was directed to prioritize long-term economic success, with excess profits invested into the working population of Jena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This structure is more akin to a cooperative than a charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

In the 1930s, the Nazi party attempted to place a representative within the foundation, but Carl Zeiss resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. A compromise was reached where foundation board members became nominal Nazi party members in exchange for the foundation's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Post-WWII Division

At the end of World War II, the United States Army occupied Jena in 1945 but soon withdrew as the city fell within the Soviet zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. As part of a policy to bring leading German scientists under American control, 130 of Zeiss's top technicians and executives were quickly moved to the West German city of Oberkochen, with the board members' agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. These individuals would later rebuild a factory and the company from memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Initially, there was hope for the company to remain unified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. However, in 1947, the Soviet army shipped 94% of Zeiss's Jena-based equipment and 300 employees to the Soviet Union as war booty, which later contributed to founding the Kiev brand of cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

This led to the existence of two separate Zeiss entities:
*   **Zeiss in West Germany:** Initially called Opton, then Zeiss Oberkochen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Zeiss in East Germany:** Often referred to as Zeiss Jena or VEB Carl Zeiss Jena (VEB stands for state-owned enterprise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

These two companies operated separately for decades, producing similar products and battling in overseas courts over trademark ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. After 18 years, they eventually divided the world, agreeing not to use the Zeiss trademark in each other's half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. West German Zeiss used the name Opton in Eastern Bloc countries, while East German Zeiss used "Osgena" in Western Bloc countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Despite starting with nothing, both companies flourished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Zeiss Jena became a flagship company for [[east_germanys_semiconductor_industry_history | East Germany's semiconductor industry history]], diversifying into military technology, space technology, and semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## German Reunification and Aftermath

[[impact_of_german_reunification_on_carl_zeiss | German reunification]] posed significant challenges for Zeiss Jena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. It faced substantial overlap with its Western counterpart and was economically disadvantaged, having lost the critical Soviet military market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The reunification was turbulent, with East German industrial output falling by 51% and three million East Germans losing their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Amidst this, Zeiss Jena negotiated its future with its Western sibling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. A settlement determined that the East German parts of the traditional Zeiss company (microscopes, medical instruments, etc.) would be acquired by the West German part, along with the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The remaining 6,800-employee diversified firm was renamed Genoptics, operating in semiconductors, laser optics, and automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Genoptics was initially in danger of collapse, but the government intervened, buying 80% of its assets and saving thousands of jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. In 1998, Genoptics conducted a $400 million USD IPO and is performing well today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Carl Zeiss AG Today

Today, Carl Zeiss AG is a large, sprawling company with four main segments:
*   Industrial Quality and Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>
*   Medical Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>
*   Consumer Markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>
*   Semiconductor Manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>

These divisions provide optical systems for diverse industries, including consumer eyeglasses, cars, medical surgeries, and measuring machines/microscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Carl Zeiss heavily invests in R&D, spending 812 million euros in 2020, representing 13% of their total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Semiconductor Manufacturing Division (Carl Zeiss SMT)

Carl Zeiss SMT is a joint venture between Carl Zeiss AG (majority share) and ASML (24.9% stake) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Its core product is the optics at the heart of the lithography scanners and steppers manufactured by ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) Lithography Optics

[[evolution_of_lithography_and_optics_systems | DUV (Deep Ultraviolet) lithography]] uses ultraviolet light rays in the 193 or 248 nanometer range and powers the majority of process nodes today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Zeiss has been developing deep ultraviolet imaging systems for nearly 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Ernst Abbe himself proposed the possibility of a microscope using ultraviolet light as early as 1874 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, and by 1899, the company developed a quartz lens suitable for UV microscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

In the 1960s, Carl Zeiss began leveraging its microscope techniques to build lenses for microlithography, marking the first time such lenses were made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Microlithography demands tight control over light distortions across a relatively large space to prevent inaccurate transfer of IC designs onto silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. To achieve this, Zeiss combined multiple smaller lenses into a large optics system, featuring a "double bulge" or "bulge and waist" structure to reduce field curvature, a common optical problem where objects are sharp only within a certain area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Zeiss integrated new techniques from their microscope work to adapt to industry changes and improve the resolution for projecting IC designs onto wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. In the 2000s, the discovery of immersion lithography led to a breakthrough in resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This technique replaces the air gap between the wafer and the stepper with water, allowing ultraviolet light to shoot through water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. First proposed and validated for semiconductor use by Taiwanese scientist Burn Lin, immersion lithography enabled foundries to etch structures as small as 40 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Today, Zeiss's leading products for this technique are the Starlith 1900 series, including the 1900i <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The company invested over 450 million euros into a new factory and overcame significant engineering challenges to build these optics systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography Optics

[[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography]] is the next step in the semiconductor fabrication roadmap and a disruptive technology used in cutting-edge process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Its use of a new wavelength necessitates radical changes to the optics system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. A key challenge is that all available materials, including air, absorb high-energy UV light, making traditional lenses impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Therefore, Zeiss had to design an optics system entirely from multi-layer mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

Zeiss began working on its EUV optics system with the initiation of a micro exposure tool in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Collaborating with Lawrence Livermore National Lab and Berkeley Lab in California, they delivered the first prototype in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. The design was refined five times over subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. In 2015, the first full-field EUV optics system, the Starlith 3100, was delivered for ASML to integrate into their ASML ADT (Alpha Demo Tool) nxe 3100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

The Starlith is a multi-component system comprising:
*   Collector optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>
*   Aperture illumination optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>
*   Reticle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>
*   Projection optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>

Light from the EUV source first hits the collector, which then projects it through the aperture into the illuminator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. The illuminator spreads the light evenly before it reflects off the reticle (containing the IC chips designs) and is finally projected onto the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. The 3100 pioneered the core mechanics of the optical system, which were later refined in subsequent releases like the Starlith 3300 and 3400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Today, this technology is a critical part of EUV-based process nodes at 7 nanometers or lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

The semiconductor division of Carl Zeiss made 1.8 billion euros in revenue in 2020, growing 12% year-over-year while other divisions saw declines due to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. It contributes 30% of the group's business and holds critical strategic importance in German industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. [[carl_zeisss_partnership_with_asml | Carl Zeiss's partnership with ASML]] makes it essentially the sole company of its type, as ASML's competitors, Japan-based Nikon and Canon, produce their own optics systems, an arrangement less successful than the ASML-Zeiss collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The complexity of Zeiss's DUV and EUV optics systems is described as fantastically complicated and difficult to comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

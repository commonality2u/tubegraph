[[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | ASML's]] ascent to become Europe's most valuable technology company, displacing Japanese giants Nikon and Canon, is strongly linked to its strategic partnerships and collaborative approach within the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This collaborative ethos allowed [[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | ASML]] to gain technological leadership and market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Early Foundations and Key Alliances

[[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | ASML]] was established in 1984 as a joint venture between Dutch firms ASM International and Philips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Despite initial financial struggles that led to ASM selling its shares, [[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | ASML]] maintained strong ties with Philips, which remained a significant shareholder and geographically close partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Philips' ongoing support was crucial in helping [[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | ASML]] establish a foothold in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

A cornerstone of [[ASMLs partnerships and collaborations | ASML's]] success is its deep partnership with [[partnership_between_carl_zeiss_and_asml | Carl Zeiss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This "block" of [[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | ASML]], Philips, and Zeiss is often seen as practically unified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Notably, [[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | ASML]] has outsourced all of its optics research and development (R&D) to [[partnership_between_carl_zeiss_and_asml | Zeiss]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This strategic decision allowed [[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | ASML]] to concentrate on other areas of optimization beyond mere optics, leading to innovations like the twinscan system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## Industry Collaboration and Research

Collaboration and R&D played pivotal roles in [[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | ASML's]] success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### Commercialization of EUV Lithography
The industry's collective decision to adopt EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography as the next-generation solution was critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Major chipmakers actively supported [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]] in commercializing this complex technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This collective effort was essential, as practical EUV systems were years behind schedule and significantly over budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The commitment to EUV further widened the technical gap between [[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | ASML]] and its Japanese competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Role of IMEC
The [[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | ASML]]-Philips-[[partnership_between_carl_zeiss_and_asml | Zeiss]] block benefits from strong ties to IMEC (Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre), a semi-governmental non-profit research center in Belgium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. IMEC is recognized as one of Europe's most advanced semiconductor research centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

IMEC's importance lies in two key areas:
*   **Technology Development**: It works closely with both industry and academia to develop new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Cross-Industry Collaboration**: IMEC plays a significant role in fostering cooperation among various companies within the semiconductor industry, facilitating the development of new standards and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This exposure helps [[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | ASML]] understand how its tools are used by customers and how they interact with equipment from other vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

### Collaborative Publications and Customer Interaction
[[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | ASML's]] collaborative nature is evident in the number of joint papers published by the [[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | ASML]]-Philips-[[partnership_between_carl_zeiss_and_asml | Zeiss]] block with chipmakers, toolmakers, and chemical manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. This demonstrates an active engagement with partners across the supply chain, allowing for feedback and shared problem-solving.

## Contrast with Japanese Competitors

In contrast to [[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | ASML]], Japanese competitors Canon and Nikon lacked a similar robust collaborative framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Limited Information Exchange**: Interviews indicate that Japanese companies only exchanged information with long-term external partners, and even then, these exchanges were often limited to addressing serious problems rather than fostering ideas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Weak Industry-Academia Ties**: Ties between industry and academia in Japan were particularly weak compared to Western counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Japanese industry professionals were hesitant to share trade secrets with universities, and professors were not incentivized to see their research applied industrially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This contrasts sharply with Western universities like MIT, Stanford, and Berkeley, which have robust technology licensing organizations to guide and profit from discoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. The key breakthroughs in commercializing immersion lithography, for instance, came from an American researcher at MIT who conducted experiments under industry-standard conditions, a level of collaboration not seen in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

While Canon and Nikon initially rose to prominence in the 1980s partly due to the government-mandated VLSI research project, which forced competitors to collaborate, this level of mandated cooperation did not continue or evolve into organic, sustained industry-wide collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This lack of ongoing, deep collaboration contributed to their inability to keep pace with [[ASMLs rise in the lithography industry | ASML]] during generational shifts in lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

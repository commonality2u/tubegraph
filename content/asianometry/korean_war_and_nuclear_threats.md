During the Cold War, the Korean War played a pivotal role in shaping China's perspective on nuclear weapons, primarily due to the constant threat of American nuclear intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## China's Early Nuclear Concerns

Before the Korean War, with the United States being the sole atomic power, Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party leadership harbored fears of potential American nuclear intervention in the Chinese Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Upon visiting Stalin in December 1949 to negotiate China's entry into the Soviet Bloc, Mao sought assurance of a "nuclear umbrella" over his then-precarious country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The Soviets, having only recently broken the Western monopoly on atomic weapons, were reluctant to explicitly grant such an umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

The original text of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance vaguely stated that in the event of an invasion of one signatory country by a third, the other would "render assistance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Zhou Enlai suggested adding the clause "with all means at its disposal," which the Soviets initially resisted but eventually accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. However, no formal writing ever mentioned nuclear weapons, leaving the interpretation of these clauses open to all parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Nuclear Threats During the Korean War

These ambiguous clauses were soon tested during the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. As American forces approached the Yalu River, the border between North Korea and China, the Chinese leadership became concerned that the Americans might also invade communist China and potentially use nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Despite these fears, Mao Zedong decided to intervene, believing in China's manpower advantage and that the Americans would not risk all-out nuclear warfare with the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Mao's gamble proved correct; the Americans did not use nuclear weapons, though they certainly issued threats to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Post-War "Nuclear Blackmail"

Following the end of the "hot war" in Korea, the United States continued to leverage the nuclear weapons issue against China, which the Chinese leadership termed "nuclear blackmail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

Notable statements included:
*   **John Foster Dulles**, Secretary of State under President Dwight Eisenhower, who stated the Chinese Communist Regime had been "consistently and viciously hostile to the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **General Curtis LeMay**, commander of the Strategic Air Command, who in 1954 remarked there were "no suitable Strategic Air Targets in Korea" but suggested dropping "a few bombs in proper places in China, Manchuria, and Southeastern Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

These comments naturally caused alarm in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### Taiwan Strait Crises and US Alliances

The First Taiwan Strait Crisis in late 1954 and 1955 further heightened tensions. U.S. military leadership recommended the use of nuclear weapons, though President Eisenhower ultimately refrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. In December 1954, the United States and the Republic of China signed a mutual defense treaty, which the Communists rightly believed would embolden the Kuomintang (Gomidan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Impact on China's Nuclear Program

Even if these specific events had not occurred, Mao Zedong and the Communist Party likely would have pursued their own atomic weapon program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. However, this series of crises, particularly the nuclear threats during and after the Korean War, provided a special urgency to China's efforts to develop its own nuclear capabilities, directly influencing the [[development_and_expansion_of_indias_nuclear_program_including_international_relations | Chinese indigenous nuclear weapon development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

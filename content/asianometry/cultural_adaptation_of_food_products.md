Despite the area's cuisine not being particularly known for wheat, Indonesia is the world's second-biggest consumer of instant noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. In 2023, Indonesia consumed 14.5 billion servings of instant noodles, with 99% of its 285 million people having eaten it at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Indomie's Origins and Domestic Success
The [[history_of_instant_noodles_in_indonesia | history of instant noodles in Indonesia]] saw them first popularized by Taiwanese-Japanese entrepreneur Momofuku Ando <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. He pioneered the flash-frying method and founded Nissin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

In Indonesia, the Indomie brand was founded in 1972 by Djajadi Djaja <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The name "Indomie" translates to "Indonesian Noodles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Unlike its competitor Supermi, Indomie sourced its flour locally and more cheaply from Bogasari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

During a rice shortage in the late 1970s, the Indonesian government encouraged the consumption of wheat-based alternatives. Bogasari, a flour milling business, started producing instant noodles and launched marketing campaigns to promote flour-based products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This led to a business problem for Bogasari when rice self-sufficiency returned in the 1980s, leaving them with excess noodle production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

Bogasari launched its own instant noodle brand, Sarimi, which quickly gained 40% of the market due to low production costs and a significant marketing campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. In 1984, Sarimi and Indomie merged to form Indofood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Indofood later acquired Supermi, consolidating the Indonesian instant noodle market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. By 1994, Indofood controlled about 80% of the market, with Indomie holding a 60% share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Indomie initially sold in a soup format, but in 1982, it launched a soup-less dry version called Mi Goreng ("fried noodles"), which became an instant hit due to its ease of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Indofood offers over 110 flavors to accommodate Indonesia's diversity, with Mi Goreng remaining the most popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Indomie is also halal, which is important in the world's largest Muslim population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Its cheap price, ease of cooking, and taste (enhanced by MSG) contribute to its popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Global Expansion: The Indomie Brand in Africa
Indomie's international expansion began in the late 1980s, initially through word-of-mouth as Indonesian foreign workers brought the noodles abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Indofood then formed partnerships with local companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Its halal status aided its progress in the Middle East and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, achieving over 95% market share in Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a> and even operating a factory in Syria throughout its civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

However, Indomie's most significant impact has been in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Nigeria, like Indonesia, is highly diverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Its traditional cuisine blends indigenous carbohydrates like yams and cassava with beans and local meats, and has been influenced by Portuguese and British colonial history, adding elements like tomatoes, curry, potatoes, and chicken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Wheat-based noodles were not part of the traditional Nigerian diet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Yet, in 2023, Nigerians consumed about 3 billion servings of instant noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Indomie's Arrival in Nigeria
The [[indofoods_expansion_into_african_markets | Indofoods expansion into African markets]] began through the Tolaram Corporation, a company founded by Khanchand Vaswani, who had fled British India during Partition and settled in Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Tolaram diversified from textiles into various products and established operations in Nigeria in 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

In 1988, Tolaram started importing Indomie noodles into Nigeria, believing its success in Indonesia could be replicated due to Nigeria's similar young, fast-growing, and urbanizing population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Tolaram initially positioned Indomie as a convenient food for children, targeting busy mothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

However, the launch faced significant cultural challenges:
*   Nigerians were unfamiliar with noodles, initially mistaking them for worms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   They did not know how to cook or eat noodles, being accustomed to eating with their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

To overcome this, Tolaram undertook extensive educational campaigns, hiring people to demonstrate cooking methods in supermarkets, schools, and even during traffic jams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Despite these efforts, sales volumes remained low for the first six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### Localized Production and Flavor Adaptation
Committed to the product, Tolaram decided to localize production to reduce import costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. In 1995, they formed a joint venture with Indofood called De United Foods, gaining rights to manufacture and sell Indomie in West Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. They built their first noodle factory in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

The turning point came in June 2000 with the launch of a new flavor, Onion Chicken, combined with a massive marketing promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. This flavor, along with others like Pepper Chicken and Jollof (a nod to a popular local rice dish), propelled Indomie to become the most popular noodle brand in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. This success, taking 10 years to become profitable and 12 years to reach $10 million in revenue, led to sales doubling annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

Today, there are over half a dozen Indomie plants across Africa, serving Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt, and Eswatini, maintaining dominance despite new competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. This success has launched Tolaram onto a different path, focusing on consumer brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. They have vertically integrated by establishing their own packaging plants, seasoning plants, flour mills, and oil mills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Tolaram also had to "pull in" basic infrastructure like electricity, water, and waste processing due to Nigeria's poor infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

Tolaram's long-term commitment and formidable distribution network (Multipro) have made it an ideal platform for other consumer brands, leading to joint ventures with companies like Kellogg, Arla, and Colgate-Palmolive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. The [[indomie_brand_success_in_nigeria | Indomie brand success in Nigeria]] is a testament to persistent cultural adaptation, localized production, and targeted marketing, turning a foreign food product into a staple.

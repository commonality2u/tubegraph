By 1986, the Soviet Union possessed slightly over 10,000 computers, significantly lagging behind the United States, which had 1.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While the Soviet Union was once the world's third most proficient computing power at the time of Stalin's death, by the 1960s, the computing gap with the U.S. was already years long, becoming undeniable and effectively permanent two decades later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite the Soviet state's belief in science and industrial modernization, plentiful support for research and development, and access to top minds (evidenced by the launch of Sputnik and landing on Venus), the [[soviet_computer_development_history | Soviet computer development history]] faced significant hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Early Challenges and Bureaucratic Infighting

News of the ENIAC, the first general-purpose programmable computer built in the United States in 1946, reached the Soviet Union in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Although much was unknown about its workings beyond its use of vacuum tubes, the Soviets observed the West allocating substantial resources to the computing field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The Soviet government required improved calculating workflows, particularly for its nuclear weapons program, which relied on over 100 "calculator girls" performing daily eight-hour shifts of calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Concerns arose about finding enough personnel for error-free calculations of complex problems like differential equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### The ITMVT and Political Influence

In 1948, the Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Technology (ITMVT) was established within the Soviet Academy of Sciences to explore computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. However, the ITMVT's initial efforts focused on mechanical analog calculating machines due to the political influence of its director, General Nikolai Brevich. Brevich firmly believed that reliable electronic general-purpose computers were impossible in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. During the Stalin era, voicing concerns or opposing party directives was dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Sergey Lebedev and the MESM

Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Sergey Lebedev, director of the Kiev Electro-Technical Institute, learned about American digital computer efforts in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Lebedev, an electrical engineer and World War II hero, recognized the computer's national importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Over two years, he built his own "little calculating machine," the Mali Electrono-Machina (MESM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Despite its ironic name (it had 6,000 vacuum tubes and occupied 60 square meters), the MESM performed its first real calculation in December 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

In late 1949, the MESM was demonstrated to top political leaders, including future Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who was impressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This impression allowed "renegade scientists" at the ITMVT to reach out to Khrushchev, who then authorized the removal of Nikolai Brevich, enabling the ITMVT to proceed with developing a more powerful digital computer, the Bolshaya Electronia (BESM-1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### The BESM-1 vs. Strela Competition

The BESM-1, meaning "large calculating machine," was capable of 8,000 to 10,000 operations per second (8-10 kiloflops), which would have made it one of the world's fastest computers, certainly the fastest in Europe, compared to the UNIVAC I's 1 kiloflop in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

However, the ITMVT struggled to deliver the BESM-1 due to inter-ministerial conflict. The Ministry of Machine and Instrument Engineering had established SKB245 to build differential analyzers (mechanical analog computers). Despite their mandate, SKB245 soon proposed building their own digital high-speed computer, the Strela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The Strela was computationally inferior to the BESM-1 (2 kiloflops vs. 8-10 kiloflops), but its proponents argued its capabilities were sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

With Stalin's blessing, the two institutes competed, hindering BESM-1's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. For example, the ITMVT needed special cathode ray tubes for memory storage, which were only made by SKB245's ministry. They refused to supply the tubes for the BESM-1, forcing the team to use inferior mercury storage tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. A 1951 state commission ultimately chose the Strela over the BESM-1, possibly due to its "flashy lights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. However, actual users soon discovered the Strela's serious issues: frequent breakdowns and inability to solve complex quadratic equations essential for fission development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. By 1955, the head of the Soviet nuclear development effort requested BESM replacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

This early effort highlighted future Soviet issues in building a competitive computer, despite BESM-1 remaining Europe's fastest computer for a few more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The Soviets had developed a first-generation computer as fast as the West's, and arguably better, but the [[innovation_and_industrial_challenges_in_soviet_computer_industry | challenges to scale and distribute technology]] were evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Production and Economic Disparities

While the [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | Soviet and American computing advancements]] appeared neck-and-neck on newspaper headlines, the production level told a very different story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

*   **1959**: The Soviet Union produced computers worth $59 million, while the United States produced $1 billion worth of hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **1964**: The Soviet Union produced 200 million semiconductor pieces, compared to 1.36 billion by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

The Soviet computing industry failed primarily because it could not produce enough good computers fast enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Limitations of the Command Economy

In the Soviet command economy, computers failed to reach their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

*   **Limited Demand**: The Soviet military had some demand, but unlike in the West, where computer-aided automation revolutionized industrial processes like steel making and manufacturing, commercial and industrial demand for computers was not allowed to flourish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This [[influence_of_military_and_heavy_industry_on_soviet_economic_policy | influence of military and heavy industry on Soviet economic policy]] meant a critical lack of broad-based commercial drivers for computing.
*   **Lack of Incentives**: Soviet steel makers, for instance, only needed to meet their production quotas, with no incentives for steel quality or production efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Consequently, Soviet computer makers had little incentive to produce productivity-improving computers, nor to provide necessary training and customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Resource Allocation**: Ministers, failing to see the computer's full potential, were reluctant to risk their quotas by allocating limited resources to computer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This led to factories frequently lacking funding, materials, and skilled personnel. For example, in 1958, the Penza computer plant requested 50 computer experts but received only seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Systemic Distribution Problem**: This was a systemic issue; the country consistently lagged in distributing new revolutionary technologies across its economy, despite pioneering innovations in areas like steel-making and synthetic fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## The Third Generation and the "Copying" Decision

By 1959, the West began transitioning to transistors (second-generation computer technology), which made computers smaller, more reliable, and powerful industrial tools, epitomized by the IBM 1401, which sold over 12,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This spurred development in peripherals and programming paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The Soviets developed their own second-generation computers, notably the Ural series and the BESM-6 (a supercomputer capable of over a million operations per second), entering production in 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. While the Soviets were only two years behind the West in delivering first and second-generation computers, this gap widened with the advent of third-generation computers powered by integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### The IBM System/360 and Soviet Response

In 1964, IBM announced the System/360, a line of computers with backward and forward compatibility that revolutionized the industry and became a massive commercial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. In the Soviet Union, it became clear that future computer demand was immense, and the disjointed domestic industry needed centralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

*   **Public Criticism**: In 1964, *Izvestia* published the first major criticism of the country's computer efforts, highlighting the industry's disjointed nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Two years later, *Pravda* questioned if the Soviet computer industry was ready to meet national economic requirements, concluding, "Unfortunately, we must state that the situation is far from optimistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### The ES Project and the Copying Decision

In 1967, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued Resolution 1184-20 to consolidate its computing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The product was to be the "Unified System" (ES) of third-generation computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This resolution increased the computing manufacturing budget tenfold to three billion rubles by 1975 and mandated the construction of 28 new computer plants, expansion of 22 existing ones, and production of 20,000 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

To build the ES, the two ministries in charge opted to copy the design of the American IBM 360 model to ensure compatibility with 360 software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This decision was highly controversial:
*   **Opposition from Scientists**: Some argued this would make the USSR an "intellectual colony of the West" and felt it was an opportunity to pioneer a new Soviet computing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. One memo stated that copying foreign work would exclude "utilizing our own collective experience" and "bring the development of computer technology in our nation to an end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   **Access Issues**: The U.S. government forbade IBM from exporting 360 systems to the Soviet Union, meaning the Soviets would lack adequate documentation and have to acquire systems through espionage or intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **Missed Alternatives**: The United Kingdom's ICL, a major computer maker, offered to share technology and documentation from their 360-compatible System 4 line of computers in 1968, even committing funds and specialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. This alternative would have allowed 360 software compatibility, learning British programming methods, and retaining some industrial sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **Political Pressure**: Working with ICL would have pushed back the project's delivery date by at least 1.5 years, a politically unacceptable prospect given the existing Soviet-American computer gap, especially in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. The [[impact_of_political_pressure_on_soviet_space_missions | impact of political pressure on Soviet space missions]] and technological projects was significant. Additionally, East Germany had already begun copying the IBM 360, and telling them to change direction would have had negative political consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

This copying decision, documented in meeting notes, had tragic long-lasting consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Several prominent computer scientists resigned in protest, and Sergey Lebedev's efforts to reverse the decision are said to have hastened his death in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

## Long-Term Consequences and the Permanent Gap

The ES project involved over 100 organizations, 46,000 scientists, and 300,000 workers across various Eastern Bloc countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Over 15,000 ES systems were created, with much of the hardware reverse-engineered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. While the ES's 360 compatibility initially accelerated Soviet capabilities, shrinking the [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | computing gap]] from 10-15 years in the mid-1960s to 4-6 years by the 1970s, this short-term gain led to long-term loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

Starting in the 1980s, the Soviet industry struggled to reverse-engineer increasingly complex Western computers, widening the gap once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. The Soviets had lost the native industrial capacity to develop anything new on their own, making the gap permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. Industrial productivity struggled as computers aged and frequently broke down. By 1989, a quarter of all Soviet general-purpose computers were ES-1022s, made in 1974 but copying 1965 technology, making them effectively 24 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

The reliance on foreign technology also caused issues when the U.S. and the West levied export bans during international crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. While some argued that transfers allowed the Soviets to close their gap, the [[impact of Cold War technology race on computing | gap still remained]], and the Soviets never fully closed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

The [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | fall of the Soviet computing industry]] is a story of wasted talents, lost progress, foolish short-term strategic choices made by politicians over scientists, and the inherent limits of centralized planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. It reflects the broader [[challenges_faced_by_the_soviet_economy_in_its_later_years | challenges faced by the Soviet economy in its later years]].

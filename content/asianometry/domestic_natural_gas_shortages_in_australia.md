Australia, despite being the world's leading exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG), occasionally experiences natural gas shortages in its domestic markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This paradox highlights the country's vast size, abundant natural resources, and complex energy politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Uneven Distribution and Infrastructure Challenges
Australia holds significant proven natural gas reserves, estimated at around 3 trillion cubic meters in conventional reserves, potentially reaching 12 trillion cubic meters if unconventional fields like coal seam gas and shale gas are included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. However, much of this gas is unevenly distributed, with nearly 80 percent of conventional resources concentrated in the country's northwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

A major challenge for domestic supply is the difficulty of natural gas transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Australia, a very large country, lacks an integrated nationwide gas pipeline system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Its 47,000-kilometer pipeline network is a patchwork of three largely separate subsystems: the northern, western, and eastern markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Each market relies on its own local natural gas fields and pipeline systems, largely isolated due to physical distance and varying regulatory regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This fragmented system contributes to a significant national energy security problem, as Australia cannot easily transport gas from areas of plenty to areas of urgent need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. For instance, the distance from Dampier in Western Australia to Sydney is approximately 3,202 miles, making a privately built, economically sustainable pipeline unfeasible for private actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

## Historical Policy and the Northwest Shelf Venture
In the 1960s and 70s, new gas field discoveries attracted foreign interest, leading to feelings of economic nationalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. In 1970, Australia's federal government imposed a general export embargo on LNG to prioritize domestic requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

However, the discovery of massive gas reserves in the Northwest Shelf, including Scott Reef, North Rankin, and Goodwin fields (estimated at over 300 billion cubic meters), presented a dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. These discoveries far exceeded Western Australia's domestic needs, making export crucial for the project's viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The existing export ban and government requests for at least 50 percent local ownership (due to resentment of foreign multinational involvement) hindered the A$12 billion project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The Western Australian market alone was too small to justify the massive investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

The Whitlam federal government (1972-1975) proposed building a national pipeline grid and took over an existing pipeline project from Moomba to Sydney in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This project, however, faced political and environmental challenges and took three years to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

Political tides turned in 1975 with a more business-friendly government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. After some changes in ownership that naturally met the 50% local ownership threshold (e.g., Burma Oil selling to BHP), the federal government lifted the export embargo in 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This allowed the Northwest Shelf venture to proceed, initially exporting 50 percent of its gas production, provided domestic requirements were considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Tax benefits were also introduced to facilitate the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The first LNG exports from the Northwest Shelf project began in 1989, primarily to Japan and later China, which together purchase 75 percent of Australia's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

While the Northwest Shelf project significantly benefits Western Australia, providing 64 percent of the state's energy needs, the country's other markets, particularly the eastern market (covering major cities like Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Hobart), face greater supply challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Eastern Market Challenges and Unconventional Gas
Australia's domestic energy demand is growing rapidly, driven by increased industrial demand, with consumption growing at about 0.6 percent annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Despite its relatively small population, Australia ranks 19th globally in electricity consumption per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

The eastern and southern regions of Australia lack conventional natural gas fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. This has incentivized developments in unconventional natural gas, particularly coal seam gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Large deposits of methane are absorbed within coal seams in these regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Historically, this methane, a workplace hazard and potent greenhouse gas, was vented into the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

A coal seam gas boom began in Eastern Australia when BHP achieved commercial production in Queensland's Bowen Basin in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Gas production grew ninefold due to domestic eastern market growth, supported by state governments pushing for a switch from coal to gas, such as Queensland's 2005 gas scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

However, export markets again beckoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. The Queensland state government approved three consortia to build LNG plants and export coal seam gas to Asian markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. The first of these, operated by Santos, came online in December 2014, followed by APLNG in January 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Today, three LNG plants on Curtis Island collectively produce 26 million tons of LNG annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. Eastern Australia's proximity to Asia provides a price advantage for its LNG exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

## Current Situation and Future Outlook
In 2020, Australia briefly surpassed Qatar as the world's leading LNG exporter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. While Australia's role as a reliable natural gas exporter has helped stabilize global energy markets, its domestic markets continue to face significant energy shortages and rising prices, hindering growth and causing political challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

Ideas such as a transcontinental pipeline or a nationwide gas reservation policy are discussed, but there is no single solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Australia's [[challenges_in_transporting_and_distributing_natural_gas_in_australia | natural gas dilemma]] will persist until a coherent nationwide strategy incorporating various solutions can be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by its high volatility, with booms often followed by busts at a rapid pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Even in normal times, conditions are unpredictable; semiconductor shipments can soar 70% in one year and crash 40% the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Currently, the industry is experiencing a significant chip shortage, leading to concerns about a potential future glut as everyone races to build or expand their fabrication plants (fabs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Dynamics of Demand and Supply

Effective planning, including capacity forecasting, can help avoid shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. According to the chairman of Foxconn, large customers generally have proper precautionary planning, limiting the impact of shortages on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

However, actual forecasting is challenging because end-users do not directly purchase microchips in large quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Instead, chips are bought by vendors who integrate them into consumer goods like PCs and smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. These chips have a short shelf life due to the rapid release of new products, which can quickly render current iterations obsolete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Missing an annual product launch cycle, as AMD experienced in the mid-2000s, can have severe consequences for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Double Booking and Macroeconomic Influences

Foundry customers constantly press for quick production and shipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Their desire to secure stock in uncertain times can lead to "double booking" orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. TSMC Chairman Mark Liu identified double booking as a major reason why the current shortage might not be as severe as it appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. He attributes this phenomenon to legitimate reasons such as the pandemic and ongoing China-America trade tensions, with the latter being a larger and more persistent concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Demand for semiconductors is also significantly affected by the broader macro-economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Electronics are consumer items, and consumer purchases of items like iPhones and laptops decrease during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. For example, three downturns in semiconductor business cycles were linked to oil shocks in 1975, 1982, and 1991, and another to the Asian Financial Crisis of 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. In March 2020, the stock market dropped 25%, and experts predicted a collapsing world economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Companies cut expenses and hunkered down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. However, stimulus packages and money printing led to an unexpectedly rapid economic rebound in Q3 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Over-supply as a Cycle Trigger

A 2005 study indicated that triggers for semiconductor down cycles are not primarily decreases in demand, but rather surges in semiconductor inventory levels and fab capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This points to over-supply being more significant than under-demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## The Economics and Costs of Fab Construction

Building a fab requires a substantial financial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Rock's Law and Escalating Costs

While Moore's Law observes that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, less known is **Moore's Second Law**, also called **Rock's Law** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Named after an early Intel investor, Rock's Law states that the cost of semiconductor tools doubles every four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. These tools constitute 75% of a fab's total cost, significantly driving up expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

The cost of leading-edge fabs has dramatically increased:
*   In 2000, a leading-edge fab cost $1 billion, double its 1995 cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   By 2005, this increased to $3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   In 2020, TSMC's leading-edge N5 fab in Tainan cost approximately $17 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   Their next-generation N3 process fab, also in Tainan, is estimated at $19.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

Foundries must invest billions of dollars before they can even begin to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. New fabs start losing value almost immediately after their creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Fixed Costs and Market Behavior

Much of a fab's construction costs are fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. However, the marginal cost of producing an additional chip is nearly zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This incentivizes foundries to produce and sell as many chips as possible to amortize their high fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

When supply exceeds demand, prices collapse, reducing profits for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Despite this, foundries are incentivized to sell every chip they can make, even if it generates only a small gross profit, to contribute to their future survival costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Industry leaders like TSMC and Samsung prioritize market share over profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. They avoid mothballing capacity to prevent business from going to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Their massive economies of scale allow them to drive market prices down to their "survival price," which is significantly lower than that of other industry players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## The Semiconductor Business Cycle

The result of these dynamics is a fierce downcycle that eliminates less efficient companies through bankruptcies and buyouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This process re-balances supply with demand, resetting the cycle and preparing for the next chip shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This cyclical nature is likened to the saying from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms: "The empire, long divided, must unite; long united, must divide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Government Subsidies and Their Effects

There has been significant discussion about [[government_subsidies_and_their_effects_on_the_semiconductor_industry | government subsidies]] to build fabs globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   China has a $20 billion semiconductor plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   President Joe Biden included $50 billion in his stimulus plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   The EU is allocating 145 billion euros for a 2-nm cutting-edge fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

In the US, two key pieces of legislation, the CHIPS Act and the American Foundries Act, are in development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. These would establish an R&D fund and a 20-40% tax credit for acquiring semiconductor production equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The tax credit's effects are expected to be short-term, impacting three to five years or one fab generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The R&D fund, however, is anticipated to have longer-lasting effects, particularly in fostering public-private partnerships like the one that created EUV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

While acknowledging the value of national sovereignty and government investment in high-priority areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, there are also concerns about commercial ventures needing to be self-sustaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Subsidies, by design, create distortions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. While a 40% subsidy can attract manufacturing to the USA, these subsidized fabs must eventually become self-reliant unless subsidies continue indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Renewal of these credits may face increased scrutiny once the current chip shortage resolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Current Global Fab Build-Out

Currently, there is a large [[global_investments_in_semiconductor_fabs | global build-out of fabs]] underway, with fabs considered "super hot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

Examples of major investments include:
*   **TSMC's Arizona fab**: Construction has been ongoing for a year, with whispers of an upscale from the original plan of a small 20,000 wafer fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The completed facility could produce 25,000 to 100,000 wafer starts per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Samsung's Austin fab**: Negotiations are underway for a major investment of tens of billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Global Foundries**: Spending $1.4 billion on expansion and moving up its IPO, possibly to secure capital or for Middle East investors to cash out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **SMIC**: Receiving $2.35 billion from the Shenzhen government for a project expected to produce 40,000 wafers a month by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

Even smaller, second-tier foundries are building out or upgrading their fab capacity, with numerous announcements about new sites and projects, none of which have a process node under 10nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This significant increase in capacity, potentially hundreds of thousands of wafers coming to market in the next 1-2 years, raises questions about whether the market can sustain such demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. The US Department of Defense, for instance, buys 1.9 billion semiconductors annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, but a single TSMC Arizona fab at 50,000 wafers a month could theoretically produce 3.5 billion dies *per month* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. The long-lasting boom of the current semiconductor cycle, widely reported in the media, faces an inevitable bust given this rapid expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

The early years of the Compaq Computer Company were marked by "absolutely insane growth" that remain "the stuff of legends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Founded in 1982, Compaq achieved $111 million in revenue in its first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Following its IPO in December 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, the company's revenue grew to $329 million in 1984, representing 200% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. By its third year, revenue reached $504 million with 53% growth, earning it a spot on the Fortune 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Compaq later hit $1.2 billion in revenue in 1987, achieving this milestone faster than any company in history at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Compaq played a pivotal role in the PC industry, leading an "insurgency of IBM PC clone-makers" against IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This movement eventually "overwhelm[ed] the old lion" and "unlock[ed] the PC standard" for a new generation of manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Engines of Growth

In its early years, Compaq's growth was driven by several key factors:

### Product Innovation and Compatibility
Compaq offered a breakthrough product that was both compatible with, yet differentiated from, the original IBM PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The Compaq Portable, while not a true laptop, could be transported, which the original IBM PC could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. IBM didn't introduce its own portable until February 1984, over a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Combined with a cheaper price, the Portable was a suitable second computer for working professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Compaq also excelled in producing computers compatible with IBM's extensive business software ecosystem, including Lotus 1-2-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This required meticulous "cleanroom" engineering to re-implement the IBM PC BIOS code and maintain fidelity to IBM PC hardware, including the keyboard layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Speed to Market
Compaq's product development cycle was significantly faster than IBM's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. While IBM's process took 12 to 18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, Compaq's "messy and chaotic" approach took just 6 to 9 months, allowing them to bring new technologies to market faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. A classic example is the Deskpro 386, the first IBM PC clone with leading-edge silicon, which launched a full year before IBM offered a similar product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Compaq was also faster than competitors, including IBM, in stocking shelves with products, providing a "compelling alternative" when IBM struggled with demand and frequent stock-outs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Distribution Strategy
Compaq's third major growth engine was its relationship with dealers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Unlike IBM, which sold through its own sales force and retailers, Compaq made retailers its exclusive distribution channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Cofounder and CEO Rod Canion emphasized "Keep the seller sold" and viewed a "dealer done right" as the "best distribution mechanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This saved the company money by not requiring a large sales force and fostered strong dealer loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Salesmen appreciated that corporations had to buy Compaq products through them, unlike IBM where large accounts could go directly to IBM for discounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## The High Point

After launching the Deskpro 386 and leading the [[Compaq's role in the PC clone market|revolt of PC clone makers]] against IBM, Compaq appeared to be thriving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Its instant success was widely admired, with business media praising its ability to select the right products at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. In 1990, Rod Canion was interviewed by Harvard Business Review, which lauded Compaq's consensus-oriented culture and seemingly "counterintuitive notions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. For example, in an industry driven by innovation, Compaq defined innovation as "staying within the boundaries of accepted industry standards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Expanding Despite "Attack of the Clones"

While industry observers noted that price would become "very significant" for PCs due to their modularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> (similar to the [[rise_and_fall_of_the_hard_disk_drive_industry|Hard Disk Drive]] industry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, Compaq continued its growth trajectory. By mid-1985, the PC clone ecosystem had improved to the point where components could be easily assembled, making Microsoft's OS software and Intel's silicon the primary differentiators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The Deskpro 386 inspired numerous competitors like Dell and Gateway, which offered equally powerful but cheaper "super-clones," often through direct selling models that cut out dealer markups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

Despite these emerging pressures, Compaq continued to grow revenues and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. While companies like Apple and [[Sun Microsystems business model and initial success|Sun Microsystems]] struggled against the clones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, Compaq's revenues multiplied fivefold to $3 billion between 1986 and 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

### European Expansion
A significant driver of this sustained growth was the company's European operations, led by Eckhard Pfeiffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Pfeiffer, who joined in 1983, established Compaq's dealer-only structure across the UK and Europe with minimal guidance from HQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This ignited substantial growth in a largely untapped market dominated by IBM, Apple, and Olivetti <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. The British subsidiary was profitable in its first month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Pfeiffer expanded with new subsidiaries across Europe and built a factory in Scotland to manage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. By 1990, over half of Compaq's revenues came from abroad, primarily Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Pfeiffer's Turnaround and Continued Growth

Despite a mini-recession in 1990-1991 and internal debates about strategy under Rod Canion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, Eckhard Pfeiffer's appointment as CEO in October 1991 marked a new phase of intense growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Pfeiffer was seen as having the "intensity, drive, and the execution skill to take on the clones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

His strategy was simple: "Make millions of low-cost PCs, and turn it into a volume game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Price War**: Pfeiffer immediately cut prices across the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **New Products**: In June 1992, he unveiled 16 new products, including the low-cost ProLinea desktop and Contura laptop lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. The cheapest 386 Compaq was 50% cheaper in 1992 compared to 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. The ProLinea desktops quickly became best-sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Expanded Distribution**: Compaq expanded distribution by signing deals with large computer superstores targeting home consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   **R&D Investment**: R&D spend increased to $173 million in 1992, higher in absolute terms than almost any other clone maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

Pfeiffer's strategy led to a "remarkably fast turnaround" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. In 1992, Compaq sold 150% more computers than in 1991, with revenues reaching $4.1 billion (up 25%) and net profits growing to $213 million (up 63%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

The turnaround continued into 1993, with massive volume leading to new efficiencies and cost reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. Factories in Houston, Singapore, and Scotland ran seven days a week to meet demand, and a new factory was established in Shenzhen, China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. In August 1993, Compaq introduced the Presario, an all-in-one computer line for the home and home office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. The Presario, designed for computer novices, became Compaq's new best-selling line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

In 1993, Compaq's revenue jumped from $4 billion in 1992 to $7 billion, with profits hitting $867 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. By early 1994, Fortune magazine praised Pfeiffer's "stunningly complete turnaround" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

## The Boom Years and Market Leadership

The 1990s were a period of "massive run for the PC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. The world PC industry grew an average of 18% annually from 1990 to 1999, with shipments increasing from 24.2 million to 113.5 million units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. Consumer sales were a major contributor, with US household computer ownership rising from 15% to 35% between 1990 and 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>.

Pfeiffer transformed Compaq into a mass-market, volume PC maker, selling products across all price points and functionalities, from $25,000 servers to sub-$1000 laptops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. In 1994, Compaq achieved $10.9 billion in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. The following year, 1995, sales grew to $14.9 billion, allowing Compaq to surpass IBM and Apple and become the world's largest PC maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. This victory in 1995 can be seen as a turning point, marking the end of easy growth in the home and home office PC market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

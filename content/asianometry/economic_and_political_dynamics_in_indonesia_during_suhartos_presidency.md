At its peak, Indonesia's [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] was a $22 billion giant, the country's biggest business group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Its founder, Lim Sol Young (also known as Sudono Salim), was Southeast Asia's richest man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The group's remarkable ascent was largely due to its personal connection with authoritarian leader Suharto, who was a personal friend of Lim and leaned on the company as a core collaborator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Few companies dominated a single country like the [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] did Indonesia, until the [[impact_of_the_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | Asian financial crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Suharto's Rise to Power

Lim Sol Young, born Lin Xiaolian, fled the Sino-Japanese War in 1938 and arrived in Java at age 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. He started as an [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_chinese_businesses_in_indonesia | ethnic Chinese]] trader, initially selling clothes and then starting a coffee grinding business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. During the Indonesian National Revolution (1945-1949), Lim launched a supplies business, smuggling essentials like soap, coffee, sugar, and rice to the Republican Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. It's been suggested he also ran guns and ammunition, though he denies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. In Central Java, Lim impressed soldiers with his diligence and personality, leading to an introduction to Suharto, a logistics officer and cousin of Cilardi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Indonesia gained independence in December 1949 with Sukarno as its first president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Sukarno's early years were challenging for foreign investors and the [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_chinese_businesses_in_indonesia | Chinese ethnic minority]] due to his socialist leanings and suspicion of foreign capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. In 1958, his government seized all Dutch assets in Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Anti-Chinese violence also broke out, fueled by resentment over their business dominance and perceived support for the Dutch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

In 1952, facing discrimination, Lim moved to Jakarta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Suharto, appointed commander of the local division in Semarang in 1956, rekindled his friendship with Lim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Suharto valued reliability, and Lim consistently came through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Over time, Lim became Suharto's go-to person for financial matters, and Suharto became Lim's patron and protector as he rose through military ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

Sukarno's anti-imperialist ideologies brought him closer to the Communists, while his vision of endless revolution neglected the economy, leading to hyperinflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. He steadily lost power, culminating in the chaos of 1965-1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. On September 30, 1965, an attempted coup led to the kidnapping and killing of seven senior military officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Suharto, not targeted, led a Western-backed counter-coup that devolved into mass killings of hundreds of thousands of suspected Communists, [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_chinese_businesses_in_indonesia | ethnic Chinese]], and other leftists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. In March 1966, Sukarno transferred power to Suharto, who declared a "New Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Suharto's "New Order" Economy

Suharto's presidency marked a significant shift in Indonesia's internal and external policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Indonesia ended its undeclared war with Malaysia, dissolved alliances with communist China, and rejoined the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Internally, the government focused on reforming the economy, which suffered from hyperinflation and insufficient revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

Indonesia, with its large population, cheap labor force, and abundant natural resources, rebuilt its tax base and opened up to foreign capital and aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Foreigners were invited to set up light manufacturing facilities for shoes and textiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This development plan led to consistent economic growth throughout Suharto's reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## The Era of [[crony_capitalism_and_its_role_in_building_indonesias_largest_business_empire | Crony Capitalism]]

The new economic growth under Suharto also brought opportunities for corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. The military and business community had been closely intertwined since the 1950s, when military commanders partnered with local businessmen (known as *kukong*, Hokkien for "boss") to raise funds, offering favors and concessions in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This relationship strengthened after Suharto came to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

Suharto crafted a [[crony_capitalism_and_its_role_in_building_indonesias_largest_business_empire | crony capitalist]] political pyramid that collected rents on a broad range of economic activities, flowing upwards to himself and his elite circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The government partnered with economic cronies in the private sector to achieve its goals, granting them preferential benefits to execute these goals and generate profits for redistribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. Suharto ensured a separation of economic and political power, making his [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_chinese_businesses_in_indonesia | Chinese business partners]] dependent on him for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

### The Rise of [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] as a Crony Example

Lim, initially one of Suharto's *kukong*, quickly became the biggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

*   **Cloves**: In 1966, the government granted Lim one of two exclusive licenses to import cloves from Africa, a critical ingredient for Indonesia's *kretek* cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Lim received a small percentage of profits, with the majority going to a slush fund owned by the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This provided crucial early funds for Lim to expand into more lucrative businesses like food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Flour and Instant Noodles**: Indonesia was introduced to wheat by the United States in 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. In the late 1960s, Lim partnered with Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok to open flour mills, founding Bogasari Flour Mills in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Bogasari quickly received a monopoly for wheat import, milling, and distribution in Western Indonesia, covering 80% of the country's population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This was immensely profitable, with 25-35% profit margins, especially as Indonesians warmed to wheat products like [[history_of_instant_noodles_in_indonesia | instant noodles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Again, 26% of the company's profits were designated to foundations headed by Suharto and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]]'s food business later expanded to form Indofood, a multi-billion dollar conglomerate producing [[history_of_instant_noodles_in_indonesia | instant noodles]], biscuits, milk, and chips, and controlling 90% of the Indonesian [[history_of_instant_noodles_in_indonesia | instant noodle]] market by the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Cement**: Following Indonesia's first five-year development plan (Repelita) to build domestic cement capacity, Suharto directed Lim to enter the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. With Taiwan's Tuntex Group, [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] built a massive cement complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. During the 1970s oil export boom, Lim built one of the world's biggest cement companies, controlling 60% of Indonesia's total cement production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. When oil prices tumbled in 1984, Suharto ordered the government to purchase 35% of what is now PT Indocement, effectively bailing out Lim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Banking**: Lim had purchased a small knitting company with a banking license in the 1950s, which he renamed Bank Central Asia (BCA) and moved to Jakarta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. BCA remained small until 1975 when Lim recruited Mukhtar Riady, who had built Peninbank into Indonesia's largest private bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Riady transformed BCA by targeting customers of Lim's empire and overhauling its systems, making it Indonesia's biggest private bank in just three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

By the end of the 1970s, [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] had grown from 3 companies in 1957 to about 54 companies in six fields: trading, automobile manufacturing, property and construction, finance, and natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. By 1986, there were over 225 Lim-affiliated businesses, making nearly a billion dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. An 1989 estimate counted over 350 companies affiliated with Lim, many of which were monopolies or near-monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

## Economic Challenges and Suharto's Decline

By the 1990s, Suharto, in his 70s, was becoming out of touch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. His children began flexing their political muscles, elbowing out trusted advisors, and their incompetence and self-interest started to turn public opinion against the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. An infamous example was in 1990 when Suharto created a single clove monopoly for his youngest son, Tommy, who ran the industry into the ground, necessitating a $350 million bailout from Bank Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Lim and his family, sensing this change, began diversifying investments offshore through First Pacific, a financial services company founded in Hong Kong in 1981, making foreign investments that didn't rely on political relationships with Suharto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

The oil export boom of the 1970s dried up in 1985, prompting the government to pass reforms to ease import and export regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. Initially, these reforms helped shift the economy away from oil and gas revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. However, in 1994, non-oil exports sputtered as investors, like [[postwar_economic_reforms_in_japan | Japan]], pivoted from Indonesia to China, which was experiencing rapid growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. The Indonesian government responded with more reforms, removing limits on foreign investment and opening new sectors, though protections remained for sectors dominated by Suharto's children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. This seemed to work, with foreign investment rebounding and GDP growth reaching about 8% annually in the following years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

During this period, the [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] experienced its greatest expansion, growing at 40-50% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. By 1996, independent analysts estimated Lim's total revenues across all his companies to be $22.8 billion, constituting 4% of Indonesia's total GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. In 1997, Lim's net worth reached $4 billion, making him the world's 68th richest man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

However, this boom was built on short-term external debts, doubling from $70 billion in 1990 to $140 billion by mid-1997, mostly borrowed by the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

## The [[impact_of_the_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | Asian Financial Crisis]] and Suharto's Fall

When Thailand floated its currency in July 1997, it triggered a contagion across Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. Indonesia's rupiah was floated in August, losing over 30% of its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. This devaluation deeply affected Indonesian banks, including [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]]'s BCA, as their foreign-denominated debt soared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. Intense competition from banking reforms in 1989 and high non-performing loans meant many small banks became insolvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

In October 1997, 16 commercial banks closed, leading to bank runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. Rumors led to a run on BCA, costing $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. The IMF intervened with a $33 billion bailout package in October 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. This bailout came with stringent economic reform conditions, including disassembling state and private monopolies, cutting subsidies on basic goods, and further opening up the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.

While Indonesia's GDP grew 4.6% in 1997, it contracted by 13% in 1998, with construction shrinking by 37% and manufacturing by 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. Millions lost their jobs, and food and living costs skyrocketed due to the weak currency and drought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. The IMF reforms directly targeted monopolies often dominated by Suharto's cronies and family, hitting his supporters at a critical time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. Suharto resented these foreign-imposed conditions, stating: "We have 30 years experience building a strong Foundation. Then in six months it collapses, not because of an external crisis but because there is manipulation of our currency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

Relations with the IMF deteriorated, leading them to withhold payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>. In May 1998, mass riots erupted in response to fuel subsidy cuts, targeting [[challenges_and_controversies_faced_by_ethnic_chinese_businesses_in_indonesia | ethnic Chinese]] and their businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. A massive pro-democracy student demonstration demanded Suharto's resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. Abandoned by his cabinet members, Suharto resigned on May 21, 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

## Aftermath for [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] and Suharto's Legacy

Lim's home was attacked and set on fire during the riots, and his son, Anthony Salim, had to pay bribes to evacuate the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. BCA and other [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] companies suffered damage, but the real blow came from the bank's association with a government crony, leading to a "titanic run" on BCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. BCA collapsed, forcing the central bank to take over it and its $5 billion in debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.

With a new president and political environment, the massive and largely insolvent [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Empire]] began to break apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. Anthony Salim negotiated a settlement, handing over stakes in over 100 Indonesian businesses, like Indocement and Indomobile, to repay the $5 billion bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. Crucially, [[the_rise_of_salim_group_and_its_connections_with_suhartos_regime | Salim Group]] managed to retain a 50.1% share in their food company, Indofood, and moved these holdings offshore to the family's First Pacific financial company in Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. Indofood has since become one of the world's biggest food companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.

Lim never returned to Indonesia after 1998, dying peacefully in Singapore in 2012 at age 95, with an estimated net worth of $655 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>.

Suharto's governance brought substantial economic benefits, with 32 years in power seeing 7% annual economic growth and the development of agricultural and manufacturing bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. However, the "dark side" of this growth was who it enriched: Suharto, his cronies, and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

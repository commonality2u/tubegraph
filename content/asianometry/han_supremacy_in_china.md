From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Han ethnic supremacy has become an emerging point of concern on China's internet and in cultural backwaters. This attitude, though potentially dismissible as fringe, represents real people expressing their views and is considered a serious problem due to its widespreadness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">00:00:01</a>.

## Defining "Han" and the Supremacist View
Defining "Han" is a complex question, similar to defining "white" in America, where historically, groups like Italians and Irish were not initially considered white, but times change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">00:00:31</a>. Han ethnicity is a constructed bundle of different items, subject to the times and current era, rather than a distinct nationality, ethnicity, or race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">01:00:00</a>. Factors like adherence to Confucian values or certain rites contribute, making it an "I know it when I see it" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">01:10:00</a>. The existence of groups like the Hakka and Cantonese further illustrates this nuanced identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">01:20:00</a>.

In contrast, Han supremacists dispense with this nuance, viewing "Han-ness" as a single, mono-race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">01:28:00</a>. According to one supremacist site's constitution, "Han people are the core race in China" and "the interests of the Han race are one in one with those of China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">01:34:00</a>. They describe the Han as having five thousand years of direct racial inheritance and possessing some of the "purest blood in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">01:43:00</a>.

However, the reality is that Han people are genetically a deeply intermixed breed, having mixed for generations as they migrated across China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">01:54:00</a>. The speaker states that Han people are "a race of interbred mongrels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">02:09:00</a>.

## Historical Context and Political Evolution
For over the past 1,000 years, China has been ruled longer by foreigners than by members of its own Han people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">02:16:00</a>. Han nationalism played a significant role in toppling the Qing Dynasty and establishing both the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">02:21:00</a>. Centuries of ethnic minority rule by the Manchu people "grated against the Han majority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">02:33:00</a>. Chinese elites seeking power would rail against the "furry and horned Manchu people," attempting to unite the "pure Han race" against their enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">02:37:00</a>.

When the ROC came to power, Sun Yat-sen recognized that continued feelings of [[comparisons_of_ethnocentrism_in_china_and_the_united_states | Han supremacy]] would eventually divide the country, especially as other World War I-era empires with significant minority populations (like Russia and Austria-Hungary) were splitting up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">02:49:00</a>. Consequently, Sun Yat-sen and the Guomindang party founders promoted racial harmony as a core tenet of ROC rule, personified by the five-colored flag and the principle of "five races under one union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">03:09:00</a>. Despite this, [[comparisons_of_ethnocentrism_in_china_and_the_united_states | Han ethnocentrism]] persisted, leading to the suppression of ethnic minorities and major social problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">03:30:00</a>.

### Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Ethnic Minorities
The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) drew significant support from China's ethnic minorities who were disillusioned with their standing in the ROC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">03:39:00</a>. These minorities disproportionately supported the Communist Party, becoming one of their critical constituencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">03:47:00</a>. Mao Zedong personally held strong views on the value of China's ethnic minorities.

> "All through the ages, the reactionary rulers, chiefly from the Han nationality, sowed feelings of estrangement among our various nationalities and bullied the minority peoples. Even among the working people, it is not easy to eliminate the resultant influences in a short time. So we have to make extensive and sustained efforts to educate both the cadres and the masses in our proletarian nationality policy, and make a point of frequently reviewing the relationship between that Han nationality and the minority nationalities. If the relationship is found to be abnormal, then we must deal with it in earnest and not just in words." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">04:01:00</a>

The PRC pays significant attention to [[ethnic_minority_policies_in_china | ethnic minority]] and racial harmony issues for both ideological and practical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">04:45:00</a>. While not known for gender equality, the CCP has done an admirable job of finding and promoting high-performing cadres from [[ethnic_minority_policies_in_china | ethnic minorities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">04:54:00</a>.

In the 1950s, the CCP helped create and codify China's [[ethnic_minority_policies_in_china | ethnic minorities]], sending teams to locate, classify, and protect non-Han ethnic cultures, which resulted in the creation of 56 separate nationalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">05:06:00</a>. The People's Congress then crafted a series of [[ethnic_minority_policies_in_china | affirmative action policies]] and preferential treatment to help China's minorities achieve an even level with the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">05:24:00</a>.

Some of these benefits include:
*   Regional [[ethnic_minority_policies_in_china | ethnic autonomous states]] within China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">05:33:00</a>.
*   Dedicated museums, parks, schools, events, and authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">05:39:00</a>.
*   Preferential treatment in China's national testing exam (gaokao), where minorities in western China might need 200 points compared to 500 for Han people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">05:43:00</a>.
*   An exemption to the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">05:55:00</a>.
*   Similar policies are reflected in Taiwan, where members of recognized aboriginal tribes receive similar benefits in their college exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">06:01:00</a>.

## Resentment and the Rise of Han Supremacist Movements
These [[ethnic_minority_policies_in_china | affirmative action policies]] were introduced to address significant existing gaps between ethnic minorities and the Han majority in areas like income, wealth, and employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">06:11:00</a>. However, these policies have not successfully closed those generational gaps and have largely cultivated resentment from the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">06:33:00</a>.

Han Chinese view themselves as the crucial drivers of the Chinese nation and its glorious history, but feel they have not been treated equally to ethnic minorities; in fact, they are often seen as "part of the problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">06:44:00</a>.

Such views have found strong adherence in darker corners of the Chinese internet, with dozens of Han culture forums and websites emerging in China, Taiwan, and the overseas Chinese diaspora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">07:01:00</a>. A famous one, "Han Net," which is now closed, advocated for the revitalization of certain aspects of Chinese Han culture while rejecting others for their non-Han origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">07:12:00</a>.

For example, netizens "cringed" at the idea of China encouraging the wearing of Qing-era Manchu clothing like the *chi pao* or *makwa* (horse jacket) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">07:24:00</a>. Instead, they advocated for the *hanfu* clothing worn before what they called "alien rule" or the Manchu conquest of the Ming Dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">07:34:00</a>. The *hanfu* movement went mainstream largely because the clothes were considered "cute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">07:44:00</a>. For many, it remained just "nice cosplay" or a way to connect with their culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">07:50:00</a>. However, the *hanfu* movement and other sites promoting Han culture eventually served as a "gateway drug" for "harder versions of [[comparisons_of_ethnocentrism_in_china_and_the_united_states | Han supremacism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">07:59:00</a>.

### Historical Revisionism Against the Manchu
[[Comparisons of Ethnocentrism in China and the United States | Han ethnocentrists]] hold a special dislike for the Manchu people, vigorously fighting to revise views of the Qing and Ming dynasties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">08:05:00</a>. They paint the Qing Dynasty and its Manchu leaders as bloodthirsty, claiming they rolled back the Ming Dynasty's progressive advancements, stole Han wealth, butchered them, and made China a "backwards country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">08:16:00</a>. They argue this allowed the West to move ahead and eventually invade, portraying the Manchu as "colonists" akin to the British in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">08:31:00</a>. They cite historical records of countless deaths related to the Qing conquest of the Ming Dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">08:38:00</a>.

However, the Qing conquest of the Ming Dynasty was a long, complicated series of wars, often involving Han fighting against Han <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">08:48:00</a>. Boiling it down to "bad Manchu victimizing innocent Han" is seen as hijacking history for specific purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">08:57:00</a>. This historical revisionism, which often devolves into "insane Manchu conspiracy theories," does not follow regular rules of logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">09:08:00</a>. The goal is to reject the celebration of some 300 years of China's history and pin its decline on a foreign race, thereby absolving the Han of blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">09:25:00</a>.

### Criticism of Affirmative Action and Demographic Shifts
The CCP's [[ethnic_minority_policies_in_china | affirmative action policies]] receive legitimate grief and online criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">09:44:00</a>. Critics perceive a "quiet deal" where ethnic minorities receive special privileges in exchange for not attempting independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">09:53:00</a>. The two policies causing the most resentment are the preferential national examination thresholds and the exemption to the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">10:01:00</a>.

The one-child policy exemption has led to an increase in the proportion of [[ethnic_minority_policies_in_china | ethnic minorities]] in China from 3% in 1949 to 8% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">10:13:00</a>. While Han Chinese still number 1.2 billion, Han supremacists view this as the Han people being the "only country in the world with the people conducting their own self-destruction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">10:22:00</a>. This, combined with easier *gaokao* thresholds for minorities, creates a perception that "there are more ethnic minorities running around and they are dumber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">10:39:00</a>.

Incidents of ethnic violence, such as the late 2000s riots in Urumqi, also bring out the worst of the Han supremacists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">10:52:00</a>. They complain that ethnic minorities can attack Han people or rob them, and authorities will keep letting them do it "in the name of national unity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">11:04:00</a>.

## Parallels with the United States and Future Challenges
Racial issues are a challenge for any government with minority and majority populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">11:17:00</a>. While China is often seen as a "one-race monolith," ethnic minority problems cause significant challenges for the Chinese government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">11:25:00</a>.

Parallels can be drawn to the United States:
*   **Inclusive School of Thought:** In China, this advocates for acceptance into Chinese society and even the Han race if one practices Confucian values and rites, believing "China is a nation of many races and we are all in this together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">12:27:00</a>. In the US, it's about expanding the definition of "American" to be more inclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">11:56:00</a>.
*   **Darker School of Thought:** In China, this advocates for an inherent gap between Han people and "barbarians" (a label with deep historical significance), arguing that other races are "born barbarians" and assimilation is a "fool's errand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">12:45:00</a>. In the US, darker schools of thought argue for America's success being built on Christianity and exclusively Christian values, or even for American white ethnocentrism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">12:07:00</a>.

These issues are not limited to China, with sites appearing in America, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other places where Chinese people live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">13:07:00</a>. However, the problem is most troubling in areas with significant Han majorities and substantial minority populations, such as China and Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">13:21:00</a>.

The Chinese government has attempted to dodge these internal concerns and foster cross-ethnic unity by creating a feeling of "us of China versus them of the West," promoting anti-foreign sentiment to suppress [[comparisons_of_ethnocentrism_in_china_and_the_united_states | Han supremacism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">13:32:00</a>. While this tactic might work in the short term, its long-term health is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">13:51:00</a>. The speaker views [[comparisons_of_ethnocentrism_in_china_and_the_united_states | Han supremacism]] as a serious and widespread problem, noting that it's easy for government officials, many of whom are Han, to be seduced by such a creed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">14:24:00</a>.

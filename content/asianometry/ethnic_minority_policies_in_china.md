Han ethnic supremacy is an emerging concern on China's internet and cultural platforms, though it's important not to dismiss it as mere chatter, as these are real views expressed by real people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Defining "Han" and Historical Context

The definition of "Han" is complex and subject to the times, similar to how the definition of "white" has evolved in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Han ethnicity is not a distinct nationality, ethnicity, or race, but rather a "constructed bundle of different items" grouped together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Adherence to Confucian values and certain rites can contribute to this definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The existence of groups like the Hakka and Cantonese further illustrates this fluid definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

In contrast, Han supremacists simplify "Han-ness" as a single, mono-race, claiming Han people are the "core race in China" with "five thousand years of direct racial inheritance" and "purest" blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The interests of the Han race are deemed "one in one with those of China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. However, Han people are genetically "a deeply intermixed breed," having migrated and mixed for generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

For over a thousand years, China has been ruled longer by foreigners than by Han people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. [[Deng Xiaoping's leadership and its influence on Chinese foreign policy | Han nationalism]] played a role in toppling the Qing Dynasty and establishing both the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Centuries of rule by the Manchu people grated against the Han majority, with elites railing against them to unite the "pure Han race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Republic of China's Approach to Ethnic Harmony

When the Republic of China (ROC) came to power, Sun Yet-sen recognized that continued Han supremacy would divide the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. He observed other World War I-era empires with significant minority populations, like Russia and Austria-Hungary, splitting apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. To avoid a similar fate for Qing-era China, Sun and the Kuomintang party promoted racial harmony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This was symbolized by the five-colored flag of the Republic of China and the principle of the "five races under one union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. While the ROC sometimes advocated for a single unified Chinese race, [[comparisons_of_ethnocentrism_in_china_and_the_united_states | Han ethnocentrism]] remained a lingering issue, leading to the suppression of ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Ethnic Policies

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) gained support from China's ethnic minorities who were disillusioned with their standing in the Republic of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. These minorities became a critical constituency for the CCP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Mao Zedong personally held strong views on the value of China's ethnic minorities, acknowledging that Han nationality rulers had historically "sowed feelings of estrangement" and "bullied the minority peoples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. He emphasized extensive education for cadres and masses on proletarian nationality policy to eliminate these influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

The PRC pays significant attention to ethnic minority and racial harmony issues for both ideological and practical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Despite not being known for gender equality, the CCP has "done an admirable job of finding and promoting high-performing cadres from ethnic minorities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Codification and Affirmative Action

In the 1950s, the CCP helped create and codify China's ethnic minorities by sending teams to locate, classify, and protect non-Han cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This resulted in the creation of 56 separate nationalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The People's Congress then crafted a series of affirmative action policies and preferential treatment to help China's minorities achieve an "even level with the Han majority" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

These benefits include:
*   Regional ethnic autonomous states within China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   Dedicated museums, parks, schools, and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   Preferential treatment in China's national testing exam (*Gao Kao*), where minorities in western China, for example, might require only 200 points compared to 500 for Han people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   An exception to the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Some of these policies are also reflected in Taiwan, where recognized aboriginal tribes receive similar college exam benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

These policies were introduced due to significant income, wealth, and employment gaps between ethnic minorities and the Han majority, similar to those between white and black Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Challenges and Resentment

Despite these policies, the generational gaps persist, and they have largely succeeded in cultivating resentment from the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Many Han perceive themselves as the crucial driver of the Chinese nation and its history, yet feel they are not treated equally to ethnic minorities, and are even seen as part of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

The two policies causing the most grievance among netizens are the national examination preferences and the exemption to the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. The one-child policy exemption has increased the proportion of ethnic minorities in China from 3% in 1949 to 8% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. To Han supremacists, this is seen as "self-destruction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The easier thresholds for national examinations contribute to a perception that there are more ethnic minorities who are also "dumber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

Incidents of ethnic violence, such as the late 2000s riots in Urumqi, also fuel anti-minority sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Complaints arise that authorities are lenient towards ethnic minorities involved in attacks or robberies in the name of national unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Han Supremacism and Historical Revisionism

Such views find strong adherence in dark corners of the Chinese internet, with dozens of Han culture forums emerging in China, Taiwan, and the overseas Chinese diaspora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. These groups advocate for the revitalization of certain aspects of Han culture while rejecting others for their non-Han origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. For instance, they promote [[the_hanfu_movement_and_cultural_revitalization | Hanfu]] clothing worn before the Manchu conquest of the Ming Dynasty, rejecting Qing-era attire like the *chi pao* or *makwa* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. While the [[the_hanfu_movement_and_cultural_revitalization | Hanfu Movement]] went mainstream partly due to the aesthetic appeal of the clothes, it also served as a gateway to "harder versions of Han supremacism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Han ethnocentrists hold a special dislike for the Manchu people, vigorously revising views of the Qing Dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. They portray the Qing Dynasty and its Manchu leaders as bloodthirsty, claiming they rolled back Ming Dynasty advancements, stole Han wealth, butchered Han people, and made China a backward country, thus allowing the West to invade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This historical revisionism aims to "reject the celebration of some 300 years of China's history" and pin its decline on a "foreign race," absolving the Han of blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

## Parallels and Government Strategy

There are parallels between China's ethnic issues and those in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Both nations, founded on ideals of binding different peoples together, face challenges in living up to those values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. In China, one school of thought advocates inclusiveness, suggesting that individuals can be accepted into Chinese society or even the Han race by practicing Confucian values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This view promotes China as a "nation of many races" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. However, a darker school of thought advocates for an "inherent gap between the Han people and the barbarians," arguing that other races are "born barbarians" and assimilation is futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

This problem is most troubling in areas with significant Han majorities, particularly in China and Singapore, which are the only Han-majority countries with substantial minority populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. In China, the government has attempted to dodge these concerns and foster cross-ethnic unity by creating an "us of China versus them of the West" mentality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. By encouraging an "acceptable level of anti-foreign energy," the government aims to suppress feelings of Han supremacism, though the long-term health of this tactic is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

Han supremacism is a serious problem due to its widespread nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. It is easy for those in power, who may themselves be Han, to be seduced by the idea of belonging to a "supreme race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

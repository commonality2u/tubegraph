Sri Lanka, once known as Ceylon, has had its economic development closely studied for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Recent events have added a "bitter new page" to its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Post-Independence Strengths and Early Challenges

When Sri Lanka gained independence from the British in 1948, after over 150 years as a colony, it possessed several advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>:
*   **Strategic Location** The island held a strategic trading port location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure** It had suffered no infrastructure damage from World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   **Social Indicators** The country ranked well in education and population health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   **Political Stability** Sri Lanka was a democracy with universal suffrage, pointed to as a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Export Economy** It inherited a highly productive export economy, specializing in tea, rubber, and coconuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

In 1950, Sri Lanka's Gross National Product (GNP), adjusted for purchasing power parity, was higher than that of India, Pakistan, Thailand, and even [[the_impact_of_historical_legacies_on_south_koreas_economy | South Korea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. By 1960, its per capita gross income of $141 was significantly higher than Thailand's ($96) and Indonesia's ($50), and on par with [[the_impact_of_historical_legacies_on_south_koreas_economy | South Korea]]'s ($156) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. An advisor in the late 1950s noted that the country's main challenge would be maintaining its high living standards across a growing population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The development plan initially focused on expanding agricultural exports through infrastructure in less populated dry zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

However, this promising start hid underlying issues, including a dangerous mix of flammable ingredients and fateful policy choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Ethnic Tensions and Early Policy Shifts

Sri Lanka has historically been a multi-ethnic nation, primarily dominated by the Sinhalese (majority Buddhists, speaking Sinhala) and the Tamils (Hindus, speaking Tamil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. These groups are geographically concentrated, with Sinhalese largely in the southwest and north-central provinces (about 75% of the population) and Tamils in the northern and eastern provinces (about 13% of the population) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Their relations have historically been tense, with devastating consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The 1948 Sri Lankan constitution was not based on broad-based consensus among ethnicities but rather discussions between Sinhalese elites and colonial administrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, failing to address minority concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

The first general election brought the conservative United National Party (UNP) to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Facing challenges from the left-wing Lanka Sama Samaja Party, the UNP implemented expensive food subsidies (funded by booming commodity prices from WWII and the Korean War) and disenfranchised Indian Tamils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. When the Korean War ended in 1953, commodity export revenues crashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The government had to raise rice prices and other public service costs, leading to widespread protests known as the "Hartal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This event forced the prime minister's resignation and led to the UNP losing the 1956 general election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

The new government in 1956 marked a worsening of relations between the Sinhalese and Tamil communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Political parties abandoned multi-ethnic stances, and Sinhala was instituted as the country's only official language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Shift to [[sri_lankas_import_substitution_policies_and_their_impact | Import Substitution Policies]]

Economically, the new government imposed import restrictions on consumer goods to conserve foreign currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The state then established monopolies to fulfill these import demands domestically, marking a shift to [[sri_lankas_import_substitution_policies_and_their_impact | import substitution policies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

While such policies have a place (e.g., [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | Taiwan]], [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | South Korea]], and Japan used them for industrialization, particularly in heavy and specialty chemical industries in the 1970s), their success depends on context and a larger economic strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Earlier attempts at [[sri_lankas_import_substitution_policies_and_their_impact | import substitution]] in [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | Taiwan]] and [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_korea_s_economic_landscape | South Korea]] in the 1950s (targeting textiles and fertilizers) failed to achieve growth rates, did not increase foreign exchange reserves, and led to corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

In Sri Lanka, wide-ranging [[sri_lankas_import_substitution_policies_and_their_impact | import substitution policies]] led to inefficiencies as the government tried to manage everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Domestic products became more expensive, and import demand shifted from finished goods to raw materials, making the economy vulnerable to price shocks in raw goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

By the 1970s, Sri Lanka transformed from a relatively open, market-based economy into one of the most closed non-communist economies in the world, leading to a dramatic slowdown in economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. By 1977, Sri Lanka's per capita income was only $200, a mere $60 increase from 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. For comparison, in 1977, [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | South Korea]]'s per capita income was $820, Malaysia's $930, Thailand's $420, and Indonesia's $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

The country's "crown jewel," its plantation economy, fell into disarray due to government threats of nationalization (which occurred in the 1970s), leading to declining foreign investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. The government also became the employer of last resort, doubling its share of GDP from 1961 and providing over 50% of manufacturing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This scenario, which favored Sinhalese elites in employment and education policies, bred radical ideologies among minority Tamil youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Reforms and Opening Up (1977-2007)

The slow economic growth eventually built political will for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. In 1977, a new government came to power, attempting reform and opening up the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The regime aimed to attract foreign investors and establish a labor-intensive export development economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Policies included:
*   Establishing free trade zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   Guarantees against nationalization without compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   Devaluing the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   Attempting to limit state participation in the wider economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   Reducing the rice subsidy, a long-standing taboo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

This was a prime opportunity, as Sri Lanka was opening up before China and many other Asian nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. The international community praised the shift and provided unprecedented foreign aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Growth surged from 2.9% a year before 1977 to 6% annually between 1977 and 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Garment exports grew from 2% to 16% of total exports, and tourist numbers more than doubled, nearly tripling foreign exchange earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

However, the 1977 election also brought Tamils to power on a platform for an independent Tamil state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The government failed to properly calibrate for the initial downsides of liberalization, which hit the poorest hardest through inflation, removal of food subsidies, and lifting trade protections on farmed goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Money from subsidies and foreign aid was wastefully funneled to loss-making state-owned "zombie companies" and questionable mega-[[effects_of_debt_and_infrastructure_projects_on_sri_lankas_economy | infrastructure projects]] like a new capital city and a house-building program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

These worsening conditions, coupled with the government's authoritarian tactics against Tamil protests, ignited a cycle of violence and retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Tamil militant wings consolidated into the LTTE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. In July 1983, an LTTE attack led to a brutal anti-Tamil pogrom ("Black July"), plunging the country into chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The LTTE, supported by the Tamil diaspora, established a de facto state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The brutal civil war, though with pauses, would not end until 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Despite the civil war, the government continued its opening-up policies, aiming to build a labor-intensive export industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Some loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs) like textile mills were privatized or closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This reform drive continued even after a new center-left government, the People's Alliance, took power in 1994, moderating its populist platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

Manufacturing gained prominence, ending the historical dependence on plantation agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Garments, rubber-based products, and gems became top manufactured exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Sri Lanka's textile and garment industry became globally competitive, attracting major customers and evolving into multinationals themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

During the civil war, the economy grew at about 5% annually, and poverty declined from 29% in 1995 to 15% in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. However, the war caused missed opportunities; for example, Motorola and Harris Corporation departed to Malaysia in the 1980s due to political instability, a significant loss considering Malaysia's electronics industry today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

## Post-Civil War Boom and Underlying Fragilities (2007-Present)

In 2007, a new administration led by Mahinda Rajapaksa came to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. His government, with support from countries like China, launched a massive military campaign that finally defeated the LTTE in 2009, bringing peace to the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. This decisive victory allowed the president to consolidate power, expanding executive powers through constitutional amendments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

Facing high energy prices and the global financial crisis, the government emphasized its role in "guiding the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. In 2012, it reimposed export tariffs on tea and rubber to encourage domestic processing, marking a reversal from 30 years of trade liberalization and opening up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

Despite this turn away from liberalization, the five years after the civil war's end saw strong economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>:
*   GDP grew 7% a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   The stock market boomed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   Per capita income grew from about $1,000 in 2004 to $3,200 in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
*   Inflation fell from 22% in 2008 to 3.17% in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   Unemployment halved from 8% in 2004 to 4% in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
*   Poverty rates declined from 15% to 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

By 2019, Sri Lanka had become an upper-middle-income country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

### Unsustainable Growth and Growing Debt

However, this boom masked unhealthy growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. The main drivers were not sustainable:
*   **Debt-Fueled Projects** 70% of the real GDP increase from 2004 to 2013 came from debt-fueled major public sector construction and [[effects_of_debt_and_infrastructure_projects_on_sri_lankas_economy | infrastructure projects]], rather than labor-intensive manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
*   **Fiscal Deficits** Sri Lanka regularly ran fiscal deficits, repeatedly breaching agreements with the IMF, and its annual debt-to-GDP ratios steadily increased after 2012, hitting nearly 87% in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. This was further fueled by a massive tax cut under President Gotabaya Rajapaksa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
*   **Questionable Investments** Mega-projects like the Colombo Port City project (part of China's Belt and Road Initiative) had questionable economic viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. The location was far from war-torn regions but close to the government's power base, and projects showed signs of corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. (Notably, only about 10% of Sri Lanka's total debt is owed to China; the majority is to international bond markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.)

Meanwhile, traditional economic drivers were sidelined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>:
*   **Manufacturing Decline** Manufacturing's share of GDP peaked at nearly 20% in the early 2000s but trended downwards to 15% thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Growth in manufacturing focused on the domestic sector (food, beverage, tobacco) rather than export-oriented industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Vietnam, embarking on manufacturing later, surpassed Sri Lanka in market share among developing countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Remittances** Domestic dissatisfaction led many Sri Lankans overseas for work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. The UN estimated nearly 2 million Sri Lankans work abroad, with 100,000-200,000 more leaving annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. Their remittances became a major economic driver, representing 68% of the economy and the second-biggest earner of foreign income after exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. In 2019, $6.7 billion in remittances covered over 85% of the country's foreign exchange shortfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

## Impact of the [[impact_of_the_covid19_pandemic_on_sri_lankas_economic_crisis | COVID-19 Pandemic]]

The shift from manufacturing to debt-funded [[effects_of_debt_and_infrastructure_projects_on_sri_lankas_economy | infrastructure]] supported by remittances reduced Sri Lanka's resilience to external shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, which arrived with the [[impact_of_the_covid19_pandemic_on_sri_lankas_economic_crisis | COVID-19 pandemic]] in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

Key economic drivers were significantly impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>:
*   **Exports** Garment, tea, and rubber exports to locked-down countries quickly declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Expected export earnings of $18.5 billion for 2020 fell to $11 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   **Remittances** Foreign remittances drastically declined due to lockdowns affecting workers abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Tourism** The tourism industry, Sri Lanka's third-biggest foreign exchange earner, was severely hurt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Following suicide bombings in 2019 and the pandemic, tourism plummeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. In 2018, 2.5 million tourists generated $5.6 billion; in 2020, only half a million tourists came, and earnings declined by 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

With its major foreign currency generators crippled, the government turned to [[sri_lankas_import_substitution_policies_and_their_impact | import substitution]] (e.g., for fertilizer) to preserve foreign reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. This led to domestic shortages, power cuts, rationing, and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. The Sri Lankan rupee saw a substantial drop in value against the US dollar since March 2022, worsened by extensive money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.

The economic hardship has been a long time coming, with [[impact_of_the_covid19_pandemic_on_sri_lankas_economic_crisis | COVID-19]] serving as the final push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. The way out of the crisis requires coherent political leadership, restructuring debt, returning to economic reform, and improving relations with the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

The [[Australia-ASEAN Power Link project | Australia-ASEAN Power Link]], also known as the "Sun Cable," is a mega-project aiming to transmit renewable solar energy from Australia to Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This initiative addresses Singapore's high reliance on natural gas, with 95% of its electricity currently derived from burning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, and its limited space for expansive solar or wind farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Project Scope and Design

The Sun Cable project proposes a 10-gigawatt capacity solar farm spanning 12,000 hectares in Australia's Northern Territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Solar panels will be prefabricated within Australia and assembled on-site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

The generated electricity will first travel 500 miles (800 kilometers) to Darwin, contributing to the city's renewable energy goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The remainder will be exported to Singapore via an intercontinental 2,300-mile (3,700-kilometer) High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) underwater power line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. To meet overnight demand, a battery storage system near the solar farm is planned to store excess power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The estimated cost for the farm and battery storage is around $7 billion USD based on current estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The project remains in its planning stages, with details subject to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Technology

Power transmission typically uses either Alternating Current (AC) or Direct Current (DC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. While AC systems are dominant today due to their efficiency and affordability with transformers for voltage step-up/step-down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, they face significant efficiency losses over long distances, partly due to the "skin effect" where current flows more densely at the cable's surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

HVDC systems were developed to overcome these shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
They involve converters and inverters to transform AC power to DC for transmission and back to AC for consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Although HVDC terminal equipment is expensive and complex, it provides substantially better economics for long-distance power transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The "breakeven distance" where DC becomes more cost-effective than AC is approximately 62 miles (100 kilometers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

For the Sun Cable's 3,200-kilometer length, HVDC is estimated to have about 10% electrical loss, while an equivalent HVAC line would likely exceed twice that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. HVDC is ideal for undersea infrastructure where intermediate substations are impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Challenges of Subsea Cable Implementation

Laying subsea cables involves two main considerations: minimizing overall length and avoiding deep trenches or steep slopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. While most existing subsea power cables are laid in shallow depths (<0.6 miles or 1 kilometer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, the proposed Sun Cable route will encounter waters over a mile deep in a 700-mile (1,200-kilometer) section south of East Timor at the Timor Trough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

The most economical and technically practical route would start from Darwin, cross the Timor Sea south of East Timor to Indonesia, pass through Indonesia (between Bali and Lombok or Lombok and Sumbawa), and then run up the Java Sea to the Changi area of Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

In busy waterways like the Java Sea and Singapore Strait, engineers will likely need to trench or bury the cable 2-5 feet (0.6-1.5 meters) deep to protect it from fishing nets, boat anchors, and other potential damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

A significant challenge is the limited manufacturing capacity for HVDC cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The Sun Cable project requires two cables of 3,200 kilometers each, which is more than the total annual output of all HVDC cable manufacturers in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This necessitates setting aside 3-5 years and additional investment to build up manufacturing capacity from multiple global manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Financing and Economic Implications

The subsea cable portion of the Sun Cable project is projected to cost approximately $5.6 billion USD, with $4.6 billion specifically for the cable itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Including the solar farm, the total project cost is likely to exceed $10 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

Seed funding for the privately-owned Sun Cable corporation has come from Australian billionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. However, the full funding will likely require multi-decade service agreements with the entity purchasing the power, similar to Basslink's 25-year agreement with Hydro Tasmania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Lessons from Basslink
Basslink, an existing Australian HVDC cable connecting Tasmania to Victoria, provides valuable lessons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Commissioned in 2006, it suffered a six-month outage less than ten years later, leading to a $30 million USD fine after arbitration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Such incidents highlight the importance of robust planning and maintenance for large-scale infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## Broader Opportunities and Future Prospects

Once fully deployed, the Sun Cable is projected to provide up to 20% of [[singapore_reliance_on_natural_gas_for_electricity | Singapore's energy needs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. The opportunity extends beyond Singapore, as [[economic_and_renewable_energy_implications_for_australia_and_southeast_asia | Southeast Asian countries]] are estimated to see a 65% expansion in energy demand from 2015 to 2040, primarily from fossil fuels without clean energy alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Indonesia, through whose waters the cable passes, might also sign on to receive electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

For Australia, the project represents a new energy export paradigm, moving beyond its traditional dependence on mining and petroleum exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Australia's Northern Territory, larger than Egypt but sparsely populated, is one of the most solar-irradiated areas globally, offering significant renewable energy potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. This project could strengthen relationships with Southeast Asian countries and diversify Australia's export economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.

The project is currently scheduled to come online around 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

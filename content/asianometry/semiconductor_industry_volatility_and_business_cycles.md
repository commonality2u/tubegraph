The semiconductor industry is characterized by its high volatility, with booms rapidly following busts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Even in normal times, conditions are unpredictable, with shipments capable of soaring 70% in one year and crashing 40% the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The current period is marked by a significant chip shortage, which may soon transition into a glut as new fabs are built or expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Dynamics of Demand and Supply

Effective planning, capacity forecasting, and shortage avoidance are ideal scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. However, [[challenges_in_semiconductor_forecasting_and_supply_chain | actual forecasting is challenging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. End users do not directly purchase microchips in large quantities; instead, vendors buy them to integrate into consumer goods like PCs and smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Semiconductor chips have a short shelf life due to rapid product obsolescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Missing an annual product launch cycle, as AMD experienced in the mid-2000s, can have severe consequences for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Foundry customers are always eager for immediate production and shipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Double Booking

Concerns about securing stock in uncertain times can lead to customers "double booking" orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. TSMC Chairman Mark Liu identified double booking as a major reason why the current shortage might not be as severe as it appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. He attributes this behavior to legitimate reasons such as:
*   The [[impact_of_the_pandemic_on_semiconductor_supply_chains | COVID-19 pandemic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
*   Recent [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_semiconductor_industry | China-America trade tensions]], which are considered a more significant and ongoing concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>

### Macroeconomic Impact

Demand for semiconductors is heavily influenced by the greater [[impact_of_macroeconomy_on_semiconductor_demand | macro-economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Electronics are consumer items, and purchases like iPhones and laptops decrease during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Examples of past downturns in the semiconductor business cycle include:
*   Oil shocks in 1975, 1982, and 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
*   The Asian Financial Crisis of 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>

In March 2020, as the stock market fell and experts predicted an economic collapse, companies cut expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. However, stimulus packages and money printing led to a faster-than-anticipated economic rebound in Q3 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Over-supply as a Trigger

A 2005 study indicated that [[challenges_in_semiconductor_forecasting_and_supply_chain | semiconductor down cycles are more often triggered by surges in inventory levels and fab capacity]] rather than a decrease in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This suggests that over-supply, rather than under-demand, is a primary driver of busts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Economics of Semiconductor Manufacturing (Supply Side)

Foundries and semiconductor companies are aware of the business cycle, but the industry's economics compel them to aggressively expand until the market collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### High Cost of Fabs and Equipment

Building a fab is extremely expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Moore's Law**: An observation that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit doubles every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Rock's Law (Moore's Second Law)**: States that the cost of semiconductor tools doubles every four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. These tools constitute 75% of a fab's total cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

The cost of a leading-edge fab has escalated dramatically:
*   2000: $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   2005: $3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
*   2020: TSMC's N5 fab in Tainan cost approximately $17 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>
*   Estimated cost for TSMC's next-generation N3 fab in Tainan: $19.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>

Foundries must invest billions before they can even begin to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. While much of the fab construction cost is fixed, the marginal cost of producing an additional chip is negligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This incentivizes companies to manufacture and sell as many chips as possible to amortize these fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Market Dynamics and Consolidation

When supply exceeds demand, prices collapse, and profits decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Despite this, foundries are incentivized to sell every possible chip to generate even a small gross profit for future survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

Major industry players like TSMC and Samsung prioritize market share over immediate profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. They avoid mothballing capacity to prevent business from going to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Due to their massive economies of scale, they can drive market prices down to their survival price, which is significantly lower than that of other industry participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

This leads to fierce downcycles that eliminate lower-performing companies through bankruptcies and buyouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Subsequently, supply re-balances with demand, and the cycle resets, awaiting the next chip shortage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Government Subsidies and Their Impact

There is growing international discussion and action regarding government subsidies for fab construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   China has a $20 billion semiconductor plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   President Joe Biden's stimulus plan includes $50 billion for semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   The EU is allocating 145 billion euro for a 2-nm cutting-edge fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

In the US, two significant pieces of legislation are being considered:
*   **The CHIPS Act**
*   **The American Foundries Act**

These acts aim to establish an R&D fund and provide a 20-40% tax credit for the acquisition of semiconductor production equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. While the tax credit's effects are likely short-term (3-5 years or one fab generation), the R&D fund is favored for its potential longer-term impact, especially in fostering public-private partnerships like the one that created EUV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

While acknowledging the value of national sovereignty and government investment in high-priority areas, concerns exist about commercial ventures needing to be self-sustaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Subsidies inherently create market distortions, the very intention of their existence, by encouraging more manufacturing in the USA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. For these subsidized fabs to be sustainable, they would eventually need to operate without ongoing government support, which would likely lead to increased scrutiny once the immediate crisis (like the auto chip shortage) passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## Current Fab Build-out and Future Outlook

Currently, there is a large build-out of fabs globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   TSMC is constructing its Arizona fab, with whispers of an upscaling from the original 20,000 wafer plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   Samsung is negotiating a multi-billion dollar investment to expand its Austin fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   Smaller, second-tier foundries are also building or upgrading their fab capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This includes Global Foundries spending $1.4 billion on expansion and moving up its IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   SMIC is receiving $2.35 billion from the Shenzhen government for a project expected to produce 40,000 wafers per month by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

This represents a significant increase in capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. For example, TSMC's Arizona fab alone could produce 25,000 to 100,000 wafer starts per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Combined with other expansions, hundreds of thousands of wafers will enter the market over the next one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

It is unlikely that the demand for tens of millions of chips created over the past year (e.g., from PC or crypto mining) will persist at the same level as people return to school and offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Furthermore, government demand, such as the US Department of Defense's 1.9 billion semiconductors per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, would be dwarfed by the theoretical output of a single large fab (e.g., TSMC Arizona producing 3.5 billion dies a month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

The current semiconductor boom, widely reported in the news, raises questions about its longevity and the inevitable bust that follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

For decades, Fujifilm and Eastman Kodak dominated the silver-based photographic film industry, clashing for market dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, the sudden arrival of digital photography annihilated this industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While Fujifilm was hit hard, it managed to emerge as a larger, transformed company, a stark contrast to [[kodaks_failure_to_adapt | Kodak's failure to adapt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Fujifilm's survival hinged on its ability to transition away from its core business, a strategy rooted in its initial emphasis on developing its own technology and investing heavily in R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Early Diversification and Strategic Foresight

Fujifilm was founded in 1934 as a subsidiary of Dai Nippon Celluloid Company, Japan's first cinematic film manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Unlike its competitors, it chose to produce photographic film internally, hiring a German Emulsion specialist to develop its own technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This internal development of technology became a key part of its culture and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Producing color photographic film, which requires near semiconductor-quality control due to its complex 20-layer structure, further enhanced its technical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Fujifilm's diversified business lines provided early warnings of impending market shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **X-ray Imaging**: In 1981, Fujifilm released a product for diagnostic x-ray imaging, replacing x-ray film with a photosensitive plate. This led to the Fuji Computed Radiography product in 1983, which is still in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Plate Making for Publications**: The digitization of plate making for publications like magazines raised concerns among sales managers like Shigataka Komori, who worried about a future without film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

Recognizing the challenge, Fujifilm appointed Minoru Onishi as its new president in 1980, who introduced a three-pronged strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>:
1.  **Pioneer Digital Imaging**: Produce original digital imaging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Fujifilm developed its own imaging sensors and released its first digital camera, the DS-1P, in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
2.  **Extend Analog Film Life**: Milk the analog "cash cow" by improving film image quality to prolong the business's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
3.  **Build New Business Lines**: Develop businesses entirely outside of digital photography or analog photographic film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

From the mid-1980s, [[fujifilms_diversification_strategy | Fujifilm's diversification strategy]] included investments in peripheral businesses like inkjet and optical discs, and new ventures based on core photographic film manufacturing technologies, such as cancer pharmaceuticals in collaboration with a Nobel Prize-winning scientist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Despite the core business's continued success and high profits in the 1980s, which sometimes interfered with diversification efforts, the company persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## Vision 75: A Bold Reinvention

By 2001, global demand for color film began to decline rapidly, at a rate of 20% to 30% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This was largely due to the widespread proliferation of the CMOS image sensor, which became affordable and integrated into mobile phones by 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

In 2004, with its core business imploding, CEO Shigataka Komori announced "Vision 75," a plan to guide the company beyond its roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
1.  **Strategic Reforms**: Fujifilm undertook significant cost-cutting measures, including spending $1.8 billion to cut 15,000 jobs, close factories, and cancel distribution partnerships starting in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.
2.  **New Profitable Growth Businesses**: While still committed to preserving the culture of photography by continuing film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, Fujifilm realized that digital cameras alone wouldn't replace the revenue and profit generated by film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. This led to a comprehensive transition to entirely new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

## Leveraging Core Technologies for New Markets

Many of Fujifilm's new markets grew directly from the sophisticated technologies developed for its film business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>:

*   **Fujitac (TAC Celluloids)**: Color film is composed of multiple photosensitive layers on a base. In the 1950s, Fujifilm produced triaxatate (TAC) celluloids for its film bases, known for their high transparency and smooth surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Fujifilm began selling TAC for various industries, but it found significant success as a protective covering for polarizing layers in LCD screens, becoming a billion-dollar business by the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

Inspired by Fujitac's success, Fujifilm reviewed all its laboratory technologies and identified six priority businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>:

1.  **Digital Imaging**: Focused on high-end digital cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
2.  **Optical Devices (Fujinon)**: Producing lenses for broadcast television and security cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
3.  **Specialty Chemicals/Materials**: Expanding on the Fujitac business, these lines serve the solar panel, touch panel, and semiconductor industries, even producing photoresists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
4.  **Graphics**: Items for digital printing and in-house inkjet technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
5.  **Documents**: Primarily through its Fuji Xerox joint venture, providing printers and office copier solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. By 2021, this division, renamed Fujifilm Business Innovation, became the company's largest business line, accounting for 30% of total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
6.  **Healthcare Business**: This represents the "ultimate expression of their commitment to survival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. Beyond x-ray film products, Fujifilm also sold endoscopes, ultrasonic devices, and healthcare imaging systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. Starting in 1996, the company significantly increased its patent applications for pharmaceutical products and medical care equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

    Fujifilm diversified into skin care, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. This seemingly random expansion had a strong crossover with photography film production expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>:
    *   **Emulsions**: Suspending one substance in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
    *   **Oxidation**: The process of aging photos and chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
    *   **Collagen**: The major ingredient of gelatin, used for making film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
    Fujifilm augmented its R&D with selective acquisitions, including several medical imaging companies in 2006 and Toyama Chemical in 2008 for nearly $1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

## Outcomes

For its 2008 fiscal year, Fujifilm reported its highest sales in history at 2.8 trillion yen (approximately $27 billion USD), a 100% increase from 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. By 2008, imaging products like digital cameras, which once accounted for 54% of company revenues, had shrunk to just 19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

While the business faced challenges from the 2008 global financial crisis and the strengthening Japanese Yen, leading to plateaued revenues since 2015, Fujifilm's outcome is vastly better than that of Kodak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. From 2005 to 2010, Kodak's sales declined by nearly 50%, while Fujifilm's sales grew almost 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

The key difference was that while Kodak was a consumer brand with a strong technology base, Fujifilm began as a technology company that happened to sell to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. When consumer businesses vanished, Fujifilm found it easier to return to its roots and leverage its chemical and precision chemical manufacturing expertise to diversify into new businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. Fujifilm continues to keep "film" in its name as an indication of where its technological expertise originated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

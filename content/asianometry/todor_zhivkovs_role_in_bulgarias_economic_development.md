Todor Zhivkov assumed leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party after Stalin's death in 1953, ruling for 35 years until 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. His relatively moderate rule provided the [[the_rise_and_fall_of_the_bulgarian_computer_industry | People's Republic of Bulgaria]] with unprecedented political and economic stability throughout his tenure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Vision for Economic Modernization

Zhivkov's economic policy for Bulgaria concentrated on producing machinery and tools for heavy industries such as mining, energy, and metallurgy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. He greatly admired the Japanese economy and desired for Bulgaria's economic development to follow a similar path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. He believed Japan's top two industries were heavy industry and electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. In his memoirs, he expressed his long-held dream and "weakness" for electronics, viewing it as Bulgaria's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

> "...that's what I've been dreaming about for years. Those who have interacted with me know that electronics was my weakness... I saw it as our future." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>

## Patron of the Electronics Industry

Zhivkov's vision directly influenced the extraordinary [[the_rise_and_fall_of_the_bulgarian_computer_industry | rise of the Bulgarian computer industry]] and its related electronics sector.

### Supporting Early Computing
Bulgarian scientists began studying Soviet cybernetics and the economic potential of computers in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Following a Soviet recommendation in 1956 for socialist countries to establish their own computing centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, Zhivkov's government received this message positively. Over the next two years, efforts were made to raise funds and recruit staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. In 1961, the Council of Ministers approved the creation of a new computing center within the Mathematical Institute, renamed the Mathematical Institute with Computing Institute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### The ELKA Calculator
In April 1965, the ELKA 6521, Bulgaria's first transistorized, all-electronic desktop calculator, was demonstrated before Zhivkov and the entire Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. With their approval, the calculator was exhibited internationally at the INFORGA-65 show in Moscow the following month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### Unified System of Computers
Zhivkov's government was instrumental in Bulgaria's participation in the "Unified System of Computers," a collaborative effort by the Soviet Bloc countries beginning in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. As a founding member of the Intergovernmental Commission on Computing Technology (IGCCT), Bulgaria, thanks to Professor Ivan Popov's efforts, secured an important role in the system's production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Bulgaria was assigned to produce some of the most valuable items among the 105 planned devices: memory disks, magnetic memory tapes, and a processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

To achieve this, Zhivkov's government supported Popov's initiatives to arrange technology transfer agreements with Western companies like Fujitsu for memory tape designs and to copy IBM's disk drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This support extended to the simultaneous construction of seven new plants for manufacturing various components for the Unified System computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. This strategic positioning granted Bulgaria a virtual monopoly on hard disk drives within the Eastern Bloc, which proved highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Margins on these exports were reportedly almost 200-300% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Along with a favorable Soviet oil re-export deal, these electronics exports significantly buoyed the Bulgarian economy throughout the volatile 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### Popov's Removal
Despite Ivan Popov's critical role in building Bulgaria's computer industry to unprecedented successes, his blunt political style led to his downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. In 1974, during debates for a new Five Year Plan, Popov proposed building mainframes in direct competition with the Soviet Union and East Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Zhivkov personally called Popov to his office, asking for a compromise. When Popov refused, Zhivkov removed him from the Politburo and exiled him as ambassador to Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

### Pravetz Computers
Zhivkov's influence is also seen in the production of Pravetz PCs. After the IMKO-2 personal computer was developed, its production was moved to a new factory in Pravetz, Zhivkov's hometown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. The commercial variant was subsequently named the Pravetz-82 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Decline and Downfall

In the late 1970s, the Bulgarian government ceased investing in microelectronics, potentially due to military and heavy industry economic priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This hampered Bulgaria's ability to compete, as its semiconductor industry faced limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. A potential technology collaboration with the American company Rockwell, which could have bolstered Bulgaria's semiconductor capacity, was blocked by Soviet authorities who feared it would bring Bulgaria too close to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. This decision, occurring under Zhivkov's rule, was a devastating blow to the future of the Bulgarian semiconductor industry, leading to reliance on imported chips for sophisticated computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

Todor Zhivkov lost power in November 1989, after a botched assimilation drive against the country's ethnic Turkish minority led to widespread opposition and the loss of Soviet support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. He resigned at the behest of senior Communist Party members, ending his 35-year rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. He passed away a few years later at 86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.

## Conclusion

Zhivkov's vision of transforming Bulgaria into "another Japan" by focusing on heavy industry and especially electronics brought the country tantalizingly close to this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. Under his leadership, Bulgaria's electronics industry became an export powerhouse, employing over 11% of all Bulgarian workers by 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. In 1989, Bulgaria alone exported more computers than all other Eastern Bloc countries combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, and was the sole COMECON country manufacturing hard disk memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

However, the [[the_impact_of_soviet_influence_on_bulgarias_technology_sector | Soviet link]], which was Bulgaria's biggest customer and source of its valuable computer parts monopoly, ultimately became a major handicap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. It necessitated copying Western technology, which restricted exports outside the Bloc, and prevented closer ties with the West, thereby capping Bulgaria's technological progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. After Zhivkov's fall and the subsequent collapse of the Soviet Union, the [[the_rise_and_fall_of_the_bulgarian_computer_industry | once-formidable Bulgarian computer industry collapsed]] rapidly, demonstrating the intertwined fate of Zhivkov's economic development strategy with the Soviet system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

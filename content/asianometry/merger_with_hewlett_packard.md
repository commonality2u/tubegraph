## Hewlett-Packard's Context Leading to the Merger
By the year 2000, Hewlett-Packard (HP), an iconic electronics giant, sought to reinvent itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>. Founded in 1939, HP was among the world's largest companies, ranking 13th on the Fortune 500 with $48 billion in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. While known for calculators and its profitable printer business, HP had ventured into the PC market in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. However, the commoditization of the PC business in the late 1990s impacted HP similarly to [[Challenges Faced by Compaq in the PC Market | Compaq]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

After seven years, CEO Lew Platt stepped down in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. Platt was praised for preserving the "HP Way," the company's unique culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. However, critics argued he prioritized "other stuff" over performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. Platt was also concerned about the rapid, unstable growth fueled by the commodity PC business, recognizing the need for new, profitable growth areas, possibly in the burgeoning internet industry or services, inspired by Lou Gerstner's turnaround of IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

To spearhead this transformation, HP's board selected Carly Fiorina, a fast-rising, hard-charging sales executive from Lucent Technologies, as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. Fiorina's mandate was to be an agent of change, leading HP into new businesses like information system services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. In September 2000, she made an $18 billion bid to acquire PriceWaterhouseCoopers' consulting arm, aiming to add its 31,000 information system consultants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. However, investors opposed the deal, leading to its collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

## Compaq's Situation Pre-Merger
For [[Challenges Faced by Compaq in the PC Market | Compaq]], 2000 was a difficult year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>. The bursting Dotcom bubble not only devastated DEC's high-end internet server businesses (which [[Compaqs Acquisitions and Their Impact | Compaq]] had acquired) but also flooded the market with excess PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>. Faced with these challenges, [[Compaq's Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]]'s board asked CEO Michael Capellas to explore a possible merger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>.

## The Merger Agreement
Fiorina and Capellas first met in mid-2000 at an e-marketplace consortium meeting for selling computers online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. Both being first-time CEOs attempting to turn around rigid commodity PC makers, they quickly bonded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>. A few months later, Fiorina contacted Capellas regarding [[Compaq's Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] licensing HP's Unix variant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. Capellas, in turn, promptly inquired if HP was interested in acquiring [[Compaq's Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

On September 3, 2001, Labor Day, HP agreed to acquire [[Compaq's Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]] in a stock swap valued at approximately $25 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. Carly Fiorina was slated to continue as CEO of the combined entity, which boasted combined revenues of $87 billion, nearing IBM's $90 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a>.

## Rationale and Reaction
On its merits, the merger was not inherently a bad idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. The two companies had complementary product lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. With only 15% of HPâ€™s PCs being shipped directly to customers, the company could benefit from [[Compaq's Business Strategies and Innovations | Compaq]]'s growing direct sales programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. Additionally, the merger was projected to yield about $4 billion in savings, primarily through slashing 15,000 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

However, investors and competitors were largely unimpressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>. The announcement led to a $13 billion loss in market capitalization for the two companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. One institutional investor remarked it was like "taking two stones and tying them together to see if they float" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. [[The decline and acquisition of Sun Microsystems | Sun Microsystems]]' President Edward Zander commented, "When two sick companies combine, I'm not sure what you get" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. Michael Dell noted the difficulty of such large mergers, seeing it as a "compelling" opportunity for Dell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:19">[00:31:19]</a>.

## Internal Battle and Aftermath
The acquisition process deteriorated into a personal battle between Fiorina and Walter Hewlett, the son of HP cofounder Bill Hewlett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. Walter Hewlett argued that HP was overpaying and should "stick to its knitting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. After a frantic, national election-like cross-country campaign, Fiorina secured shareholder approval for the merger by the slimmest of margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. She then rapidly commenced the integration of the two companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>.

Despite the initial chaos, the deal ultimately performed well for shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>. Fiorina was fired by the Board in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. Her successor, Mark Hurd, cut $3.5 billion in costs, laid off 15,000 jobs, clarified management roles, and grew the combined company to over $110 billion in revenues within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>. Soon after the acquisition, HP began phasing out the [[Compaq's Rise and Early Success | Compaq]] brand, though it persisted on some low-end computers until 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.

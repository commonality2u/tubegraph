India's economy is largely service-based, but the pharmaceutical sector stands out as a significant exception with an intensifying growth trend in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. As of 2020, India possesses the world's third-largest pharmaceutical industry by volume and the eleventh largest by value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It is currently the world's largest provider of generic drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, with the United States relying on India for 40 percent of its generics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. In 2020, India's pharmaceutical exports exceeded imports by $16 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, and these exports meet the strict standards and regulations of many countries worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Early Challenges and Foreign Dominance

The narrative of India's pharmaceutical industry begins with its independence in 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. At this time, millions of Indians lacked access to basic drugs, and the nation's drug industry was almost entirely controlled by foreign entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Eight of the top ten pharmaceutical firms were Western multinationals, primarily from the UK, France, and Germany, collectively holding a 90 percent market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Domestic Indian companies largely focused on marketing and distributing foreign drugs rather than developing their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Consequently, nearly every drug consumed in India had to be imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Domestic drug prices were among the highest globally, as 99 percent of these drugs were protected by patents, making them accessible only to the wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## The Patent Act of 1970: A Turning Point

To address this over-reliance on foreign drug imports, the Indian government made several attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. In 1954, they established Hindustan Antibiotics Limited (HAL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, followed a few years later by Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited (IDPL) in cooperation with the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

A pivotal moment occurred in the 1960s when British pharmaceutical company ICI Pharmaceuticals developed Propranolol, a high blood pressure medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Its high cost made it unaffordable for use in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. An Indian company named Cipla began manufacturing a generic version for the Indian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. When ICI complained, Cipla's R&D head, Yusuf Hamid, justified his actions to then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Gandhi recognized the merit of his argument and urged parliament to modify drug patent laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This led to the passing of the [[impact_of_the_patent_act_of_1970_on_drug_accessibility | Patent Act of 1970]], which revitalized the Indian pharmaceutical industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Goals and Impact of the 1970 Act
The Patent Act of 1970 had two main objectives: to ensure low-cost access to drugs and to foster the development of an indigenous Indian pharmaceutical industry, encouraging import substitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Unlike India's prior patent laws (last updated in 1872 and rooted in British IP law), which protected products, the 1970 Act introduced a new system that protected the *process* rather than the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This meant that if a different process was used to create the same drug, it could be patented in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

Additionally, the act set time limits on these process patents, typically five to seven years after filing, significantly shorter than the 15 years under the old law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The Indian patent office also gained the authority to force patent holders to license their patents at a reasonable rate if they were not being used in a socially beneficial way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

This new system opened vast opportunities for the Indian pharmaceutical industry, making it possible to reverse-engineer popular drug imports for the Indian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Reverse Engineering and Import Substitution
Following the 1970 Act, the number of firms in India's pharmaceutical industry more than doubled between 1970 and 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Initially, domestic companies primarily engaged in reverse engineering, studying the steps to make a drug and making slight modifications to the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. As a former planning director noted, early "R&D" was essentially reproducing and optimizing existing patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

This approach, while seemingly derivative, enabled domestic companies to gain significant competency in pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. By the end of the 1980s, Indian pharmaceutical companies could manufacture almost any new molecule without needing access to the original innovator's recipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The time lag between the introduction of original innovations and Indian generics steadily narrowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. For example, India's first generic ibuprofen appeared six years after its 1967 global market debut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. For ciprofloxacin, introduced globally in 1986, Indian domestic firms had a generic version in just three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. By 2006, Indian companies supplied 95 percent of the country's drugs, marking the success of its import substitution policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Drawbacks and Fragmentation

Despite its success, the 1970 patent law had drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. The industry it fostered was high in volume but low in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. With low barriers to entry and minimal capital needed to start a drug firm, the number of pharmaceutical companies in India reached around 16,000 by 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Surviving companies focused on producing as many molecules as possible at the lowest cost, leading to extremely low margins and vast overcapacity, requiring massive scale for profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The industry became highly fragmented, with up to 100 brands for a single molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Without resources, incentives, or protections for it, the domestic industry did not invest significantly in R&D and produced few new drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. By the 1990s, about 40 percent of Indian drug production was for export, but these were mostly low-value products, limiting access to more valuable markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## The TRIPS Agreement and Industry Transformation

In 1992, India signed the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), a major milestone for the Indian pharmaceutical industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This agreement required the Indian government to amend its patent policies to align with international trade standards, including recognizing product patents and granting exclusive marketing rights to new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

The signing of TRIPS was highly controversial, dividing the domestic industry into camps favoring and opposing more stringent IP protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. The opposition argued against strong IP rights due to concerns about knowledge transfers and their past negative impact on the Indian populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Ultimately, the pro-IP camp prevailed, and India was given until 2005 to prepare its drug industry for these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. The government gradually implemented the necessary changes, such as the exclusive marketing rights amendment to the 1970 patent law in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

From 1992 to 2005, the industry underwent a monumental shift, moving away from its decades-old successful model towards a new, more profitable one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

### Adaptation Strategies Post-TRIPS
Indian pharmaceutical firms adapted to these changes in various ways:

*   **Investment in R&D and Drug Discovery**: A few firms, including Ranbaxy, DRL, and Wockhardt, decided to invest in R&D to climb the value chain and enter the drug discovery business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. From 1956 to 1987, the Indian pharmaceutical industry discovered only 13 new drug compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. From 1991 to 2005, that number was seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Prior to 1992, R&D spending grew at 4.9 percent annually, but after 1992, it accelerated to 6.6 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Indian institutions' pharmaceutical drug patents in India increased significantly, from 9 (1990-1994) to 48 (1995-1998) and then to 227 (1999-2002) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The government encouraged R&D with schemes like the founding of government bodies in 1995 to coordinate academic and commercial areas and a pharmaceutical R&D support fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Diversification into Adjacent Fields**: Many firms pursued R&D in drug-adjacent fields like drug delivery, which is less technically demanding than drug discovery but still challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.
*   **Strengthening Other Value Chain Parts**: Some companies expanded and strengthened other parts of the value chain, such as marketing and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Strategic Collaborations**: Other companies formed strategic collaboration deals with multinationals. For example, Zydus Cadila entered partnerships with companies in France, Cuba, Switzerland, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Biocon, a biopharmaceutical company in Bangalore, also signed deals with large companies like Novartis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Biocon's joint venture with the Cuban Center of Molecular Immunology helped them develop the first new monoclonal antibody treatment by an Indian pharmaceutical company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Mergers and Acquisitions**: Some firms decided to scale up through mergers and acquisitions with companies operating in different parts of the value chain to match the size of Western multinationals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

## Global Export Success and Challenges

[[global_export_strategy_of_indian_generic_drugs | India's pharmaceutical companies]] had long aimed for the export market, but TRIPS significantly accelerated this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Once the industry met its IP regulation responsibilities, the global market became accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Today, India's generics industry is highly internationally competitive, benefiting from lower costs and expertise gained from competing in the intense domestic market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. A favorable generic drug regulatory environment, such as the U.S. Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984, which eased FDA approval for generic drugs, also contributed to this success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

Companies like Dr. Reddy's Laboratories saw their export ratio of overall revenue increase from 53 percent (2000-2005) to 74 percent (2012-2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Marksans Pharma's export intensity grew from 21.2 percent (2000-2005) to 97.5 percent (2012-2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. The entire industry's export intensity grew at an average rate of about 13 percent after the 2005 TRIPS implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, becoming nearly eight times its size since then, with sales to North America, Africa, and Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

### Dependency on China for APIs
One significant concern for the Indian pharmaceutical industry despite its export success is its [[indias_dependency_on_china_for_active_pharmaceutical_ingredients | concurrent dependence on China for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. These are the most crucial raw materials for finished drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. India relies on China for 70 percent of its API imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, with imports of Chinese APIs, especially antibiotics, tripling since 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. India used to produce these domestically but lost market share in the 1990s when Chinese products entered at 40 percent cheaper rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. Even today, despite higher Chinese labor costs, a price gap of about 20 percent remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

This industrial weakness became particularly evident in 2020 during China's lockdowns, which caused stock shortages and export restrictions of certain ingredients for virus medicines to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Geopolitical tensions between the two countries further highlight the need for the Indian industry and government to implement new import substitution policies for these active ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

## Conclusion

India's pharmaceutical success has not gone unnoticed globally. Ironically, as India shifted away from process-based patents, other countries began adopting similar approaches to lower drug costs and reduce multinational control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. The industry's current standing is a direct result of the "removal and re-application of these IP rights," serving as a prime example of market-driven reform spurred by environmental changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. India's approach, characterized by adapting based on what was right for them rather than rigid ideology, demonstrates a pragmatic "crossing the river by touching the stones" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Despite remaining concerns, India's pharmaceutical industry is poised to play a crucial role in addressing global health issues in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

In 1999, Nvidia coined the phrase "General Processing Unit" or GPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. This marked a significant shift in their vision, as they began popularizing the concept of general purpose computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Nvidia envisioned new applications for GPUs beyond just video game graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>, a vision that would come to fruition in the years that followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

Humans require fresh water, which is an ever-present challenge to obtain, despite oceans covering over half of the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The problem is that seawater is too salty for consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | Desalination]] is the process of removing salts from salty sea and brackish water to produce fresh water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This goal is simple, but the [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | technologies]] are complicated and [[Energy Sources for Desalination | energy intensive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Historically, these processes have often been powered by burning fossil fuels like oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Desalination Technologies

Modern desalination plants utilize one or more of three primary [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | technologies]]: Multi-Stage Flash (MSF), Multi-Effect Distillation (MED), and Reverse Osmosis (RO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Industrial-scale plants frequently combine multiple [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Thermal Processes: MSF and MED

[[Desalination Technologies and Processes | MSF]] and [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | MED]] are thermal processes that use heat to evaporate seawater into a pure vapor, which is then condensed back into water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

*   **Multi-Stage Flash (MSF)**: Invented in the early 1950s, [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | MSF]] systems involve a brine heater that first heats seawater into a vapor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This vapor is then fed through 10 to 30 chambers where pressures are rapidly reduced, causing rapid evaporation or "flashing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | MSF]] is a reliable, easy-to-operate, and highly scalable industrial process, crucial for producing water for entire cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. It is the most widely used industrial [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | desalination technology]], particularly common in the coastal deserts of the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The world's largest desalination plant, the Ras Al-Khair Power and Desalination Plant in Saudi Arabia, is an [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | MSF]] plant, generating one million cubic meters of water per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Multi-Effect Distillation (MED)**: This thermal process involves multiple stages, or "effects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Saltwater is sprayed onto steam-filled hot tubes in one stage, and the heat causes the water to evaporate into steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This steam is then fed into the next stage, creating a heat reuse cycle that makes [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | MED]] very efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Membrane-Based Processes: Reverse Osmosis (RO)

[[Desalination Technologies and Processes | Reverse Osmosis]] (RO) is a membrane-based methodology that uses electricity to push saltwater through a semi-permeable membrane made of cellulose or nylon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. High pressures are applied, allowing water to pass through the membrane while salts are caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Other membrane-based [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | technologies]] include electrodialysis, which is typically only suitable for brackish water without pre-treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Energy Efficiency Comparison

[[Desalination Technologies and Processes | Reverse Osmosis]] processes are generally more [[Trends in desalination and energy consumption | energy efficient]] than thermal processes, excluding pre-processing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   Thermal processes require about 10 to 15 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per cubic meter of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | RO]], by comparison, needs about 5 kWh per cubic meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

However, thermal processes are highly scalable and offer more reliable operation, not requiring the extensive pre-treatment that [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | RO]] does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. In [[Water scarcity and desalination in the Gulf region | Middle Eastern countries]], where [[Energy Sources for Desalination | energy]] is plentiful, [[Trends in desalination and energy consumption | energy efficiency]] has historically been a secondary concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## The Case for Nuclear Desalination

[[Desalination Technologies and Processes | Desalination]] is an [[Energy Sources for Desalination | energy intensive]] process, with much of its demand currently met by burning fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The considerable [[Environmental and economic impacts of desalination | environmental damage]] caused by this has led to interest in nuclear [[Energy Sources for Desalination | energy]] as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Historical and Current Nuclear Desalination Projects

Kazakhstan and Japan were the first countries to build dedicated nuclear desalination plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

*   **Kazakhstan (BN-350 reactor)**: In 1973, a sodium-cooled BN-350 reactor on the east coast of the Caspian Sea supplied electricity and nuclear heat to a desalination plant 12 kilometers from its host city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The reactor's heat powered the first stage of an [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | MED]] desalination system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The system operated without reports of sodium leakages or abnormal operations throughout its lifetime, generating 40,000 cubic meters of water per day until its decommissioning in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Japan (Ohi Nuclear Power Station)**: In 1978, Japan commissioned a nuclear desalination plant with the Ohi Nuclear Power Station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Its [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | MSF]] system could generate 1,300 cubic meters of potable water daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Since then, Japan has added nine more nuclear desalination plants, many of which remain in operation today without issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Other Countries**: Pakistan, India, and China have also developed their own nuclear desalination plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## [[Economic Considerations of Desalination | Economic Considerations]]

The [[Economic Considerations of Desalination | cost of desalinated water]] varies significantly based on plant design, type, and location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   A low-capacity [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | RO]] plant desalinating brackish groundwater can range from three to five dollars per cubic meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   Modern industrial [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | RO]] plants in Florida, with capacities up to 100,000 cubic meters per day, achieve costs slightly over 50 cents per cubic meter, with potential for even greater capacities at similar costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This efficiency has led to faster recent adoption of [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | RO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   In [[Water scarcity and desalination in the Gulf region | Gulf countries]], where thermal [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | desalination technologies]] are used due to abundant [[Energy Sources for Desalination | energy]], capacities regularly exceed 100,000 cubic meters per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

The single biggest [[Economic Considerations of Desalination | cost]] for desalination plants is the initial capital investment, with millions spent on construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Nuclear [[Energy Sources for Desalination | energy]] plants have even higher capital [[Economic Considerations of Desalination | costs]] due to significant upfront building expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

Aside from capital, the largest operating [[Economic Considerations of Desalination | cost]] is [[Energy Sources for Desalination | energy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Doubling the [[Economic Considerations of Desalination | cost]] of oil can increase water [[Economic Considerations of Desalination | costs]] by 70%, posing a significant issue due to oil's volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. In contrast, nuclear [[Energy Sources for Desalination | energy]]'s operating [[Economic Considerations of Desalination | cost]] is very stable, as uranium fuel [[Economic Considerations of Desalination | costs]] have little impact on water [[Economic Considerations of Desalination | costs]] once the plant is operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## System Integration

Most existing nuclear desalination systems cogenerate power and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The integration method depends on the [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | desalination technology]] used:

*   **For [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | Reverse Osmosis]]**: Generated electricity directly powers the [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | desalination]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This is relatively straightforward and efficient, often leaving power to spare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **For Thermal Processes**: The reactor generates steam, which first goes into a turbine for electricity generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This steam is then routed from the turbine to a heat exchanger to heat saltwater for [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | desalination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Most existing nuclear power reactors are large pressurized water reactors (PWRs) with over 1000 megawatt capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, but smaller reactors are being investigated for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. A nuclear plant typically has a lifespan of about 40 years, longer than a desalination plant's 25 to 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Thermal [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | desalination]] processing tubes need re-tubing every 10 to 20 years, and [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | Reverse Osmosis]] filters require regular replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## [[Environmental Impact and Safety of Nuclear Desalination | Environmental Impact and Safety]]

Safety is a critical concern, especially given public perception challenges from incidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

The biggest risk specifically related to nuclear desalination is the threat of radioactive contamination of the water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This is particularly relevant for plants using thermal [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | desalination technologies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

*   **Tritium Contamination**: The primary concern is tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen naturally produced in all reactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Tritium is highly permeable, diffuses through many physical barriers, cannot be filtered, and reacts with water to form tritiated water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Its primary health concern is cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Regulatory thresholds for tritium vary widely (e.g., 100 becquerel per liter in the EU to 30,000 in Finland), and drinking tritium is considered 25,000 times more hazardous than breathing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Mitigation Strategies**: Engineers build barriers, typically at least two loops (e.g., steam generator and a heat exchanger), between the primary reactor coolant and the seawater brine being desalinated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Pressure differentials are applied and monitored in these circuits to prevent leaks and detect unusual discrepancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Track Record**: Experience in Japan, the United States, and Kazakhstan shows that nuclear desalination consistently generates water with tritium levels below international and country-mandated regulatory limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. For example, Kazakhstan's BN-350 plant had a maximum tritium level of six becquerel per liter in its desalinated water, while Japanese systems show merely 0.5 becquerel per liter in their secondary loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. These levels are below naturally occurring tritium levels found in rainwater in Seattle (11.1 becquerel per liter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

### Other [[Environmental Impact and Safety of Nuclear Desalination | Environmental Impacts]] of Desalination

Beyond nuclear safety, other [[Environmental Impact and Safety of Nuclear Desalination | environmental issues]] relate to [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | desalination]] operations themselves:

*   **Impact on Marine Life**: Desalination plants take in ocean water, posing a threat to marine and sea life such as fish larvae, eggs, and plankton, which can be swept up by the plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Studies have shown that 10% to 30% of fish embryos can be affected, leading to past plant shutdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Mitigation for Marine Life**: Engineers attempt to mitigate these impacts with slower volume intake rates, nets, and other barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. These issues and solutions are not specific to nuclear desalination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

Atmosphere-wise, nuclear desalination appears to be [[Environmental Impact and Safety of Nuclear Desalination | environmentally benign]], with issues often outweighed by the significant secondary benefit of not burning fossil fuels for drinking water production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

## [[Challenges and future directions in desalination | Future Directions and Benefits]]

Various countries are actively pursuing nuclear desalination projects:
*   **Trialing Feasibility**: Argentina and Egypt are trialing the feasibility of the [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Russia**: Russia has explored adding desalination capacities to their floating nuclear power plants, which are repurposed boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **South Korea**: South Korea has integrated desalination capacity into their SMART reactor, a smaller, safer experimental reactor, producing about 40,000 cubic meters of water a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **China**: With significant [[Water scarcity and desalination in the Gulf region | water scarcity concerns]], China views nuclear desalination as highly sensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. As of 2020, China had about 115 desalination facilities, mostly industrial, but all powered by coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. Their first commercial nuclear desalination project at the Hongyanghe Nuclear Power Plant generates 10,000 cubic meters a day, with other projects proposed in Ningde and Haiyang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

Many countries already have nuclear power plants located near saltwater sources for cooling, making cogeneration of power and water economically attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. While solar and wind power desalination projects are advancing, nuclear desalination offers reliably high amounts of potable water at a low operating [[Economic Considerations of Desalination | cost]], provided it is done safely and correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

Nuclear desalination is capable of water-led growth for societies and economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. It allows for more water-intensive agriculture, reduces tensions and conflicts over limited surface waters, and prevents the burning of fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. While other renewable [[Energy Sources for Desalination | energies]] for desalination should be explored, the cost-benefit calculations of nuclear desalination are compelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

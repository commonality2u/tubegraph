By 1986, the Soviet Union possessed just over 10,000 computers, while the United States had 1.3 million, highlighting a significant and undeniable gap in computing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Although the Soviet Union was the world's third most proficient computing power at the time of Stalin's death, by the 1960s, the U.S.-Soviet computing gap was already years long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Early Computing Efforts and the Emergence of a Gap

The Soviet state supported science and industrial modernization, with plentiful backing for research and development in hard sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. They had top minds, having launched Sputnik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> and landed on Venus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

In 1948, news reached the Soviet Union about the ENIAC, the first general-purpose programmable computer built in the United States two years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. While the Soviets knew little about ENIAC's workings beyond its use of vacuum tubes, and many dismissed it as propaganda, they observed the West investing heavily in this new field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The Soviet government required improved calculating workflows, particularly for the nuclear weapons effort, which relied on over 100 "calculator girls" working daily eight-hour shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Concerns arose about finding enough people to perform error-free calculations, such as differential equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Initial Soviet Response and Challenges
In 1948, the Soviet Union established the Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Technology (ITMVT) within the Soviet Academy of Sciences to explore computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. However, ITMVT's initial efforts focused on mechanical analog calculating machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This direction was influenced by its director, General Nikolai Brevich, who believed reliable electronic general computers were impossible in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Voicing concerns against party directives during the Stalin era was dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Sergey Lebedev and the MESM
Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Sergey Lebedev, director of the Kiev Electro-Technical Institute, learned about American digital computer efforts in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Lebedev, an electrical engineer and World War II hero, recognized the computer's importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Over two years, he built his "little calculating machine," the Mali Electrono-Machina (MESM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Ironically named, the MESM used approximately 6,000 vacuum tubes and occupied 60 square meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. In December 1951, MESM performed its first real calculation, solving 585 possible values for a probability distribution function for an artillery weapons calculation table, requiring 250,000 calculations and two and a half hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### The BESM-1 and Internal Competition
The MESM impressed political leaders, including future Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This gave "renegade scientists" at ITMVT the leverage to depose Nikolai Brevich and proceed with a new, more powerful digital computer: the Bolshaya Electronia (BESM-1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The BESM-1, meaning "large calculating machine," was capable of 8,000 to 10,000 operations per second (8 to 10 kiloflops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. It would have been one of the world's fastest computers, and certainly Europe's fastest, compared to America's UNIVAC 1, which managed only about one kiloflop in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

However, ITMVT struggled to deliver the BESM-1 due to [[impact_of_bureaucratic_infighting_on_soviet_technological_advancements|bureaucratic infighting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The Ministry of Machine and Instrument Engineering had established SKB245, initially for mechanical analog differential analyzers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. SKB245 soon proposed its own digital high-speed computer, the Strela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Though computationally inferior to BESM-1 (two kiloflops vs. 8-10 kiloflops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, Strela's supporters bizarrely argued its capabilities were sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

With Stalin's blessing, the two institutes competed, harming the BESM-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Near completion, ITMVT needed cathode ray tubes for memory storage, but the only ministry producing them was SKB245's ministry, which refused to supply them, forcing the BESM-1 team to adopt inferior mercury storage tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. A 1951 state commission chose Strela over BESM-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. However, actual users soon discovered Strela's frequent breakdowns and inability to solve complex quadratic equations needed for fission development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. By 1955, the head of the Soviet nuclear development effort requested BESM-1 replacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

The BESM-1 remained Europe's fastest computer for a few more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. While the Soviets succeeded in developing a first-generation computer as fast as the West, and arguably better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, the true challenge lay in production.

## The Production Gap and Systemic Issues

Despite early innovation, a significant gap emerged in production.
*   **1959**: The Soviet Union produced computers worth $59 million, while the United States produced $1 billion of computer hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **1964**: The Soviet Union produced 200 million semiconductor pieces, far behind the 1.36 billion produced by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

This [[innovation_and_industrial_challenges_in_soviet_computer_industry|production failure]] was more relevant than any hostile ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing|Soviet command economy]] hindered the computer's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. While the Soviet military had some demand for computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, the West saw titanic commercial and industrial demand driven by computer-aided automation in industries like steel making and manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

Soviet steelmakers, focused on meeting quotas, had no incentive for efficiency or quality beyond that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Consequently, Soviet computer makers lacked incentives to produce productivity-improving computers or provide necessary training and customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Ministers, failing to see the computer's full potential, were reluctant to risk their quotas by allocating resources to computer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This meant factories struggled to receive funding, materials, and talent; for example, in 1958, the Penza computer plant requested 50 computer experts but received only seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This systemic issue meant the country lagged in distributing new revolutionary technologies across its economy, despite being pioneers in areas like steel-making and synthetic fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Second and Third Generation Computers

### Second Generation: Transistors
In 1959, the West began transitioning from vacuum tubes to transistors, leading to second-generation computer technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The transistor's reliability and smaller size transformed the computer from a scientific curiosity into a powerful industrial tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The IBM 1401, known as the "Model T of computers," sold over 12,000 units, replacing older punch card technologies and spurring development of new peripherals and programming paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

The Soviets also developed their own second-generation computers, including the Ural series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. The true flagship was the BESM-6, the Soviet Union's first supercomputer, capable of over a million operations per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Entering production in 1967, it saw extensive use and led to new software and multi-program operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. By then, however, Americans were already moving to third-generation technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The Soviets were two years behind the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### Third Generation: Integrated Circuits and the Widening Gap
The gap widened with third-generation computers, powered by integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. In 1964, IBM announced the System/360, a complete line of computer hardware with backward and forward compatibility, revolutionizing the industry and becoming a massive commercial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

In the Soviet Union, it became clear that demand for future computers was nearly limitless, and the domestic industry needed to consolidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Criticisms mounted, with Izvestia in 1964 and Pravda in 1966 highlighting the disjointed efforts and asking if the industry was ready to meet national economic requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

### The Decision to Copy and its Consequences
In 1967, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued Resolution 1184-20 to consolidate its computing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The product, the Unified System (ES), aimed to be a series of third-generation computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. The resolution increased the manufacturing budget tenfold to 3 billion rubles by 1975, directing the construction of 28 new plants and the expansion of 22 existing ones, with a target of 20,000 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

To build the ES, ministries opted to copy an American IBM 360 model's design for software compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This was controversial, with some arguing it would make the USSR an "intellectual colony of the West" and hinder future indigenous innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. The US government also forbade IBM from exporting 360 systems to the Soviet Union, meaning the Soviets would lack documentation and rely on [[role_of_espionage_in_soviet_and_american_nuclear_programs|espionage]] or intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

An alternative was offered by ICL, the UK's largest computer maker, in 1968, proposing to share technology and documentation from their 360-compatible System 4 line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. This offered 360 software compatibility while retaining some industrial sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. However, working with ICL would delay the project by at least one and a half years, a politically difficult prospect given the existing Soviet-American computer gap, especially in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Furthermore, East Germany had already begun copying the IBM 360, making a change in direction politically inconvenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

The decision to copy had tragic, long-lasting consequences for the [[soviet_computer_development_history|Soviet computing industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Several prominent computer scientists resigned in protest, and Sergey Lebedev's attempts to reverse the decision are said to have hastened his death in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

Over 100 organizations, 46,000 scientists, and 300,000 workers across Eastern Europe helped develop the ES, creating over 15,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Much of the ES hardware was reverse-engineered, though Soviet disk storage solutions and peripherals fell short of Western alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. While 360 compatibility did accelerate Soviet software capabilities, with CIA estimates in the 1970s suggesting the gap shrank from 10-15 years to 4-6 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, this short-term gain led to long-term loss. By the 1980s, the Soviet industry struggled to reverse-engineer increasingly complex Western computers, widening the gap once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The Soviets lost the native industrial capacity to develop new technology, making the gap permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

Industrial productivity suffered as 1970s-era computers aged and frequently broke down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. By 1989, a quarter of all Soviet general-purpose computers were ES-1022s, manufactured in 1974 but based on 1965 technology, meaning they were 24 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Linkage to foreign technology also caused issues when the United States and the West levied export bans on advanced technologies during international crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. While some argued that allowing Soviets access to American technologies would help them close the gap, the gap persisted despite technology transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

The decline of the Soviet computing industry was a story of wasted talents, lost progress, foolish short-term strategic choices made by politicians over scientists, and the inherent limits of [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing|centralized planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

The rivalry between [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | TSMC]] and [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] in the advanced semiconductor foundry business has been marked by dramatic events, including the defection of key talent and intense technological competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Liang Mong Song: A Brilliant but Difficult Talent

Liang Mong Song was considered one of [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC's founding geniuses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, described as unquestionably brilliant but scathingly difficult to work with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. He rose through [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC's]] ranks for nearly two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

After graduating from Taiwan's National Cheng Kung University (NCKU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, Liang pursued graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, under Professor Hu Chen-ming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Professor Hu, a [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] legend, was one of the company's first technical hires and later its Chief Technology Officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Hu was instrumental in bringing the FinFET to market, a transition in which Liang, a FinFET specialist, played a critical role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Liang earned his PhD and worked at AMD for over a decade, accumulating over 180 semiconductor patents and publishing more than 350 technical papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. In 1992, at age 40, he joined [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC's]] R&D department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, joining other brilliant semiconductor minds returning to Taiwan, including Professor Hu, Chiang Shang-yi (future CTO), Rick Tsai (future CEO of [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]], now CEO of MediaTek), Douglas Yu (now a [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] distinguished fellow), and [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | Morris Chang]] himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Key Technical Achievements at TSMC
These executives helped [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] make technically challenging decisions, allowing them to surpass rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. One such move was the adoption of copper interconnects in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Although IBM had invented and patented copper interconnects in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC's]] R&D team rejected IBM's licensing offer, believing their technology was inadequate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Instead, [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] invested heavily to create their own implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Within a year, a six-person team, including Liang Mong Song and led by Chiang Shang-yi, developed their own 130-nanometer process node with copper interconnects, shipping wafers in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:05:08]</a>. This allowed [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] to overtake IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Liang received the 2003 Outstanding Scientific and Technological Worker Award for this achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Liang was named on nearly 500 [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] patents and was compensated handsomely, earning over $21 million USD in stock and cash over 17 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Personality and Internal Strife
Despite his brilliance, Liang's strict and rigorous personality led to frequent clashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. He was likened to Lu Bu, a mighty Chinese general known for his ferocity and betrayal of allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

In 2005, [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | Morris Chang]] retired as CEO, replaced by Rick Tsai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This triggered a shuffle, and when Senior R&D VP Chiang Shang-yi retired, Liang expected to fill a new R&D leadership position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. However, Chiang chose Jack Sun, a rival with a broader view of [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC's]] operations and better collegial relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

[[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] transferred Liang to a new "Beyond More or More" initiative focusing on trailing-edge foundry capabilities like MEMS and advanced packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Liang, whose obsession was with the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, viewed this as a banishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. His resentment grew, leading him to "start a rebellion against his brothers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Liang's Defection to Samsung
In February 2009, Liang resigned from [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. His resignation agreement included a two-year non-compete clause with a significant financial payout held back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. He initially stated he would teach at National Tsing Hua University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

However, in October 2010, six months into his non-compete, he took a visiting scholar position at Sungkyunkwan University in Korea, which has a close association with [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:12:00]</a>. [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] Electronics, having become a world leader in memory chips and displays, aimed to "bring down [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:27]</a>.

Starting around 2009, [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] rapidly gained ground in the process node race, advancing through 45nm, 32nm, and 28nm nodes in just two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:47]</a>. Despite repeated denials from Liang about working for [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, he officially joined them in July 2011 as Executive Vice President of [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] Foundry and Technical Director of [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] LSI, bringing 10 to 20 [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] engineers with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:31]</a>.

## The Node Race and Market Impact
Upon Liang's arrival, [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] had been focusing on a 20nm process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Liang, highly motivated to beat his former employer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, pushed [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] to directly jump from 28nm to 14nm, adopting FinFET technology concurrently â€“ a monumental three-generation leap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:58]</a>.

In 2015, [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] announced their successful 14nm process node, coming online ahead of [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC's]] 16nm process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:20]</a>. This "stunning move" broke [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC's]] near-monopoly in advanced semiconductor foundries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:29]</a>.

[[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] leveraged its first FinFET implementation to attract [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:39]</a>:
*   **Qualcomm**: Announced a billion-dollar deal for [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] to produce its high-end mobile chips, a significant blow as Qualcomm had previously used [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   **Apple**: [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC's]] most valuable customer, Apple, which had first worked with [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] for its A8 chip in 2014, decided in 2015 to split production of its A9 chip (for the iPhone 6s) between [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] and [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:16:19]</a>.

In January 2015, [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | Morris Chang]] publicly admitted, "Yes, we are a bit behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:35]</a>.

## Legal Battle and TSMC's Retake
In November 2011, [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] filed a lawsuit in Taiwan against Liang, alleging he broke his non-compete agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:39]</a>. This lawsuit lasted over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:46]</a>.

Liang initially prevailed in the first trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:46]</a>. However, [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] appealed, and in the second trial, presented evidence that:
*   Liang's lectures at Sungkyunkwan were to [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] employees and took place on [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung's]] campus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:11]</a>.
*   Technical analyses showed [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung's]] 45nm, 32nm, and 28nm chips became "very technically close" to [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC's]] after 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:28]</a>.
*   Liang used a [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] email address as early as 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:38]</a>.

The judge ruled in favor of [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]], a decision upheld by the Taiwan Supreme Court, mandating that Liang could not work for [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] until after the end of 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:53]</a>.

The lawsuit and the court's decision likely impacted [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung's]] manufacturing progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:19:07]</a>. In 2015, [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] encountered issues with their Apple A9 chips, which showed higher temperatures and potentially lower battery life than their [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:24]</a>.

In response, [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | Morris Chang]] galvanized [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] into a massive R&D effort to reclaim node leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:36]</a>. Apple's next chip, the A10, became a [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] exclusive, and this trend has continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:47]</a>. As of this writing, [[tsmc_founding_and_key_influencers | TSMC]] remains the leading semiconductor foundry, with [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] in second place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:54]</a>.

## Liang's Subsequent Move to SMIC
In 2017, after his [[comparative_strategies_of_semiconductor_companies_like_tsmc_samsung_and_intel | Samsung]] contract ended, Liang moved to SMIC (Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation) in mainland China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:21:04]</a>. He demanded to hand-pick a team of 200 Taiwanese and South Korean engineers, which SMIC complied with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:47]</a>.

At SMIC, Liang became co-CEO, focusing on leading-edge processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:32]</a>. He significantly improved SMIC's 28nm yield rates from 60% to over 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:51]</a>. He also advocated for multi-generational jumps, leading the company to achieve a 95% yield on 14nm and 12nm nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:23]</a>. Efforts to purchase an [[comparison_of_asmls_products_with_competitors | ASML]] EUV machine were blocked by the US government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:37]</a>. Liang continues to push for 7nm nodes using older DUV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:53]</a>.

## The Human Element
The story of Liang Mong Song highlights that in the semiconductor industry, despite talk of million-dollar EUV machines, it is ultimately the people who are most important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:38]</a>. The industry is described as a "twisted and ruthless one," where top companies employ various strategies to maintain their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:22]</a>.

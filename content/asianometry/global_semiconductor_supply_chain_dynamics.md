A frequently discussed topic, especially in Taiwan, is the notion that America is attempting to "steal" [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This concern gained traction following local elections in Taiwan and the impending startup of [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] Arizona in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The speaker, who has family ties to Taiwan and America, addresses these anxieties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]]'s Arizona Project

[[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] began work on its new production facility in Arizona in May 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Initially, there were comparisons to the Foxconn Wisconsin scenario, though this concern has since subsided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

The initial plan for the Arizona facility was to produce N5 chips, representing the most advanced node [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] had attempted to bring outside Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. People in Taiwan initially took comfort in two factors:
*   **Small Scale**: The Arizona site was relatively small, projected to produce about 20,000 300mm wafers per month, compared to Taiwan's four gigafabs, which can produce over 100,000 wafers per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Technological Lag**: N5 was not expected to be the leading edge by the time the factory came online in 2024, as N3 was presumed to be operational by then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### New Developments and Expansions

Leading up to its December 2022 tool-in ceremony, [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] made several new announcements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>:
1.  **N4 Process**: [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] would bring its N4 process to Arizona, an upgrade to the N5 line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
2.  **Second Arizona Factory**: An additional $28 billion investment over three years was announced for a second Arizona factory, which would be equipped with N3 technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. N3 is expected to enter high-volume production by 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Despite these expansions, [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] reportedly remains committed to keeping its most advanced nodes (N2 and N1, planned for production by 2026) in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
3.  **Global Expansion**: Discussions are ongoing for expansion into other countries, including a specialty N28 plant in Japan's Kumamoto prefecture and potential plans in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

These developments mark a departure from [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]]'s long-standing norm, championed by leaders like Morris Chang, of keeping all operations, especially the most advanced, in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This shift is understandable given its impact on [[challenges_in_semiconductor_forecasting_and_supply_chain | people in Taiwan]], making them nervous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Reasons for [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]]'s Overseas Moves

The core drivers behind [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]]'s expansion are a confluence of demand and financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Customer Demand and Apple's Influence

As a commercial entity, [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] operates in close communication with its customers, foremost among them Apple, which accounts for about 25% of its total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Apple is the primary customer funding the rollout of advanced chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]]'s rise is directly linked to Apple's decision to shift from Samsung for chip production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that the company plans to source from the Arizona plant starting in 2024 and potentially from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. If Apple demands sourcing from the U.S. and the economics work, [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] will comply to avoid losing Apple to competitors like Samsung or Intel, who are also building massive new facilities in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Samsung has a $17 billion plant in Taylor, Texas, and Intel has a $20 billion plant in Columbus, Ohio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### US Government Incentives and Competition

These large build-outs are incentivized by the $50 billion in subsidies allocated by the CHIPS Act of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Strategically, [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] should take these subsidies to reduce the funding available to Intel and Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Debunking the "Stealing [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]]" Narrative

The claim that America is "stealing" [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] or its technology requires careful examination.

### No Forced Technology Transfer

Unlike typical technology transfer situations that involve joint ventures with indigenous companies or specific requirements for local content and knowledge transfer, no such conditions have been imposed on [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]]'s US operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] maintains full ownership of its fabs, a consistent practice except for one instance in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The risk of an executive defecting to start a rival company, like Richard Chang, is inherent to the industry and not specifically altered by an Arizona fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Scale of Investment: Taiwan vs. Overseas

Claims that America has "stolen" or caused "massive loss" to Taiwan's manufacturing base by taking "all" or "a lot" of its manufacturing are difficult to support with current information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

#### Capital Expenditure

[[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]]'s capital expenditure was approximately $36 billion in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The $28 billion investment in the second Arizona Fab, spread over three years until 2026, amounts to about $9 billion per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This represents 25% to 30% of the proposed annual capital expenditure, meaning the majority of the company's spending will still occur in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

#### Wafer Shipments

In 2021, [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] shipped 14.2 million 300mm equivalent wafers, projected to be 15 to 16 million in 2022 (around 1.3 million per month), with an estimated 75% to 85% produced in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The Arizona fab, upon starting production in 2024, will produce around 20,000 300mm equivalent wafers per month, which is less than 1/50th of current annual production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Even with the planned expansion to 50,000 wafers per month by 2026, it will still not be enough to shift the balance significantly without five to ten times more investment, which the current subsidies cannot provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

#### Ongoing Taiwan Investments

Despite the press attention given to the Arizona facility, [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] is simultaneously managing at least five other major build-outs within Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>:
*   New phases for existing Taiwanese fabs, including expansions in Tainan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   New N2 plants in Baoshan and potentially Taichung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   Future plans for an N1 plant in the Longtan District of Southern Taoyuan City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   A Kaohsiung Fab, originally planned for N28 and N7, which is proceeding with N28 construction despite weak N7 demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

Taiwan remains [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]]'s greatest asset, and the company has no choice but to go "all in" on Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Competing on Intel's home turf without this focus would be a recipe for failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## The Myth of US Semiconductor Self-Sufficiency

The assumption that the Arizona Fab makes America self-sufficient in silicon is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Focus on Leading Edge vs. [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | Trailing Edge]] Chips

The Arizona Fab will produce leading-edge N4 and N3 chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. However, the majority of the world's most industrially important semiconductors—those found in refrigerators, airplanes, and cars—are not leading-edge, but rather [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | trailing edge]] chips (e.g., 130nm, 65nm, N28) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. These chips are high in volume but low in price, constituting the majority of [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]]'s volume but a minority of its revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

### Taiwan's Broader Semiconductor Ecosystem

America's focus on leading-edge manufacturing overlooks Taiwan's extensive contributions across the broader semiconductor supply chain.

#### Other Foundries

Taiwan is home to other significant semiconductor foundries beyond [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]], each with specialty processes:
*   UMC (number three largest foundry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>
*   PowerChip (seventh) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>
*   Vanguard (eighth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>

#### Packaging, Assembly, and Test (OSAT)

Taiwan holds leading positions in other crucial parts of the chip supply chain, such as wafers, packaging, assembly, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. America's position in global packaging, assembly, and test capacity is notably weak (3% market share compared to 10% in fabrication) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. While the U.S. might have a chance in advanced packaging (which is expensive and mostly for high-performance computing), there is no significant government funding or facilities for conventional packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

Taiwan hosts three of the world's five largest outsourced semiconductor packaging, assembly, and testing (OSAT) companies, including the largest, ASE Group, along with SPIL and Powertech Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. These companies, operating massive fabs like those in Kaohsiung focusing on conventional packaging, are vital and often underrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Duplicating this entire global supply chain would be immensely expensive, potentially economically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

### Human Capital and Management

The vast majority of the managers running the fabs, including C-suite personnel and thousands of hard-to-replace individuals involved in R&D, operations, and [[challenges_in_semiconductor_forecasting_and_supply_chain | supply chain]] management, are located in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Losing this "brain" would severely cripple the "hands" of the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Taiwan's leadership in semiconductor manufacturing, electronics assembly, and specialty plastics is the result of billions of dollars and 50 years of industrial development, which cannot be replicated by a single new fab in Arizona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## Systemic Risk and the Future

The [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_semiconductor_industry | China-Taiwan scenario]] presents a systemic risk that extends beyond a few companies in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. A portfolio cannot be protected simply by investing in Intel stock instead of [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | TSMC]] stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. For the foreseeable future, this risk and its wider repercussions cannot be hedged against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. The status quo, broadly supported by the Taiwanese population, has been beneficial for all involved, and its continuation is hoped for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

The current [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI boom]] is driving tech giants worldwide to construct massive data centers, which are well-known for their significant [[impact_of_data_centers_on_energy_consumption | energy consumption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, their substantial [[water_usage_in_data_centers | water usage]] is also a critical concern, as energy and water needs are closely linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. A data center with 15 megawatts of IT capacity can use an estimated 80-130 million gallons of water annually, equivalent to the consumption of three hospitals or two 18-hole golf courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Types of Data Centers

Data centers vary widely in size and function, from small closet-sized setups to custom-built facilities spanning entire football fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. They are typically classified by floor space, the number of servers, or their power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The largest facilities, known as "hyperscale," typically have around 5,000 servers and span 10,000 square meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Operators like Google and Meta use these for global applications such as Gmail or Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

[[energy_efficiency_in_ai_data_centers | Energy efficiency]] in data centers is measured by Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), calculated by dividing the total energy delivered by the energy consumed by ICT equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. A PUE of 1.0 is the most efficient, meaning all energy goes to ICT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Hyperscale data centers tend to have lower PUEs (e.g., Google and Microsoft claim 1.1 or 1.2), while smaller data centers might have a PUE of 2.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This difference is largely due to more efficient [[cooling_systems_in_data_centers | cooling systems]] in hyperscale facilities, which can include modeling airflows or employing liquid cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Cooling Systems

Almost all electricity consumed by a data center is converted into heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Electronic equipment, such as hard disk drives (requiring ~45°C) and solid-state chips (up to 85°C), must be kept cool to prevent damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. [[cooling_systems_in_data_centers | Cooling systems]] maintain stable temperature and humidity, primarily using air or liquid cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Most data centers use air cooling with a raised-floor system where cold air from a Computer Room Air Conditioner (CRAC) is directed into cold aisles, absorbing heat from servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Hot air rises and is then recirculated through fluid heat exchangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. A common system uses two fluid loops: a process loop (often water and glycol) that takes heat from the data room, and a water-based condenser loop that transfers heat to the outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Cooling towers then cool the water in the final loop by evaporation, with about 1% of water evaporating for every 10 degrees Fahrenheit of cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This evaporated water must be replaced with make-up water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Energy Usage and Indirect Water Consumption

Direct cooling is one way data centers use water, but an even larger, indirect impact comes from energy generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. In 2022, data centers accounted for 1% to 1.3% of global electricity consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Thermoelectric power generation (coal, natural gas, nuclear), which boils water to spin turbines, is water-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. A Berkeley National Laboratory study found that water usage for energy generation can be 2-3 times greater than the water directly consumed by [[cooling_systems_in_data_centers | cooling systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. While evaporative cooling towers consume thousands of gallons of water, switching to air conditioning systems would indirectly use even more water due to higher power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Corporate Water Usage and Water Scarcity

Major tech companies report significant water consumption:
*   **Google** used approximately 4.3 billion gallons of water for cooling in 2022, with 25% coming from reclaimed wastewater or seawater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Digital Realty**, a real estate investment trust specializing in data centers, reported that 36% of their water came from municipal non-drinkable sources in 2022, and roughly half of their consumption was in water-stressed areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **AWS**'s 2022 Sustainability Report noted that 20 of their global data centers, including 16 in Virginia, use recycled water for cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Microsoft** aims to be water positive, sponsoring projects that replenish more water than they consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

The majority of water directly withdrawn for cooling by these companies often comes from drinkable local water supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. With 40-50% of the global population living in water-scarce areas and data centers needing to be near population centers, this adds a competing demand for water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Arizona, a leading state for data center development due to sun, cheap land, and low natural disaster risk, also experiences drought conditions and relies heavily on the Colorado River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Meta, for example, plans to fund water restoration projects in the Colorado River basin and use long-term storage credits to avoid drawing from municipal water supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Water-Saving Cooling Solutions

### Free Cooling
"Free cooling" utilizes natural environmental conditions to cool data centers without extensive HVAC systems or large amounts of evaporating water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Direct free cooling involves bringing outside air indoors, but this requires dehumidification, air filtration, and cleaning to protect electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Studies in Europe and Australia show that direct free cooling can cut energy consumption by 5.4-7.9% and up to 60% in certain regions, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Cold climates offer significant advantages, making Nordic countries attractive for data center investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

### Waterside Free Cooling
Data centers near cold water bodies can use "waterside free cooling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Google's Hamina data center in Finland, a converted paper mill, uses fresh seawater from the ocean for cooling via an existing two-loop system, ensuring the seawater does not mix with the internal fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### Heat Recapture
Another strategy is "heat recapture," where waste heat from data centers is recovered and reused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This heat (35-45°C from air-cooled centers) can be used for desalinating water, pre-heating water in thermoelectric plants, direct power generation, or district heating for homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Space and water heating account for about 6% of America's total energy consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Challenges include the limited distance heat can be efficiently moved and the lack of existing district heating infrastructure in many cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. If adopted, heat recapture would likely lead to more widespread use of liquid cooling, as liquid is more efficient at capturing and transferring heat than air, which also improves processor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

### Optimizing Temperature Ranges
The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends data center temperatures between 15°C and 32°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Raising a data center's temperature by even 1-2 degrees can offer significant financial benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Google has shown some data centers can operate at higher temperatures, though contradictory results exist regarding hard drive performance in cooler conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## The AI Boom's Impact on Demand

The ongoing [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI boom]] is rapidly increasing data center demands for energy and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Microsoft's water consumption jumped 34% from 2021 to 2022, likely due to ChatGPT and other generative [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI]] products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Bob Blue, CEO of Dominion Energy, noted a shift from typical 30-megawatt data centers to individual requests for 60-90 megawatts or greater, and large campuses requiring 300 megawatts to several gigawatts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. SemiAnalysis projects that [[impact_of_data_centers_on_energy_consumption | data center energy consumption]] will reach 4.5% of global energy generation by 2030, implying a proportional increase in [[water_usage_in_data_centers | water usage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Next-generation GPU products, like Nvidia's B100, are becoming more power-hungry, further intensifying power and [[water_usage_in_data_centers | water consumption]] for training and deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## Conclusion

The future of compute and [[ai_and_ai_chip_boom | AI]] will require substantially more electricity and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. This demand extends from semiconductor fabrication, where facilities like TSMC consume a growing share of national energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, to the operational phase in data centers, which generate significant heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. To address these challenges, future data centers must rapidly adopt a combination of free-cooling, waste heat recovery, and renewable energy sources like solar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. This transition is crucial for both sustainability and economic viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

Northeast England, once a powerhouse of heavy industry, struggled to identify its next growth sector after the decline of traditional industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This region, a first-level within England, is the least populated with under 2.7 million residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Historically, it has faced significant economic challenges, including the lowest median gross annual earnings in England and the highest proportion of the population claiming income support as of 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Its unemployment rate in 1995 was 9.1%, 50% higher than the rest of the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The area's long-standing dependence on heavy industry and coal mines, coupled with post-World War II nationalization policies that restricted new manufacturing industries, left it vulnerable to de-industrialization in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The defeat of the miners' strike in 1984-1985 further exacerbated job losses as cheaper imported coal made local mining unprofitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

By the 1990s, Northeast England felt marginalized in the global economy and believed London did not care about its economic plight, especially when compared to Scotland, which received substantially more public spending via the Barnett formula to attract multinational companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This context explains why the prospect of a [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductor manufacturing]] facility resonated so strongly with the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Siemens' Investment in North Tyneside

In 1995, the German company [[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens]] Semiconductor pledged over a billion pounds for a [[the_economics_and_costs_of_building_semiconductor_fabs | semiconductor fab]] in North Tyneside, bringing immense joy to the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This investment was considered the UK's biggest inward investment to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:14">[07:14:14]</a>.

### Motivation and Selection

[[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens]], an old German company, had enjoyed a comfortable, profitable position in its home country, supported by the German government through policies like the Bundesbank's requirement that firms produce equipment in Germany, primarily benefiting Siemens and SEL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Siemens leveraged these domestic profits to diversify internationally, including into the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

However, deregulation trends in the US and UK by the 1980s forced [[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens]] to become more competitive, international, shareholder-friendly, and market-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The global [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductor industry]] was thriving, driven by the release of Windows 95 and the rise of mobile phones, which boosted demand for computers and semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. The industry grew 29% in 1993, 32% in 1994, and 42% in 1995, with a staggering $30 billion invested in new fabrication facilities ("fabs") in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

[[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens]] Semiconductor, initially an in-house producer for other company divisions, began competing for its own customers in the 1990s, focusing on niche markets like ASICs for telecommunications, mobile phones, and automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Sales grew 40% annually in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. By 1994, Siemens was the world's 12th largest semiconductor maker, but with only 1.9% global market share compared to 7% in Europe, it sought international expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This led to a plan to triple chip sales and enter the top 10 rankings, which included establishing [[the_economics_and_costs_of_building_semiconductor_fabs | fabrication plants]] outside Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

In 1995, [[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens]] approached the Invest in Britain Bureau to discuss a UK wafer [[the_economics_and_costs_of_building_semiconductor_fabs | fabrication facility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The proposed fab, an exact copy of their successful Dresden facility, was estimated to cost 1.1 billion British pounds (785 million USD) and directly create 2,000 new jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Other potential locations included Ireland, Austria, Israel, Singapore, and Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

North Tyneside met [[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens']] criteria:
*   **Skilled workforce**: Available technician-level people willing to work shifts, and educated electronics and computing graduates from local universities or nearby Scotland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Low costs**: Salaries were 50% lower than in Austria or Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Infrastructure**: Excellent water and power infrastructure, with the government offering a direct connection to the national grid â€“ a first for a private company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Geological stability**: Required for sensitive semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Government support**: Local development agencies actively courted [[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens]] officials, offering ample government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. UK public support totaled 64 million pounds (45 million USD), though not all was used, coming in the form of tax exemptions, grants, and job training subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. While Ireland and Austria offered more lavish support (Austria offered 120 million pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, the UK offer was considered a good investment due to [[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens']] global reputation and the opportunity to establish the area as a [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductor]] destination, attracting suppliers and potentially sparking an entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Fujitsu had already built a Northeast England [[the_economics_and_costs_of_building_semiconductor_fabs | fab]] in 1989 with a subsidy three times larger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The UK government also saw an opportunity for [[technology_transfer_and_economic_implications | technology transfer]] and to replace semiconductor imports from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

[[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens]] ultimately chose the UK to commit to its growing market, where revenue grew 25% annually from 1985 to 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Siemens was the UK's 13th largest R&D investor and third largest in electronics, employing 10,000 workers across a dozen manufacturing sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### Construction and Initial Excitement

Hours after the deal was announced, local job centers were inundated with inquiries, with one center taking 4,000 calls in three hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The North Tyneside [[the_economics_and_costs_of_building_semiconductor_fabs | fab]] was built in phases to quickly capitalize on favorable industry conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Construction was rapid, with contractors breaking ground before the land was even owned, and using innovative steel frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. The fab was completed in just 376 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

Phase one, producing 16-megabyte DRAM memory units with a 0.35-micron process, began in May 1997, just a year and a half after breaking ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Phase two was planned for more advanced 64-megabyte memory units using a 0.25-micron process, aiming for 20,000 wafer starts a month and meeting the full 2,000 job requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Queen Elizabeth II toured the facility, declaring that the North Tyneside fab brought the country to the forefront of [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductor manufacturing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## The Collapse of the Siemens Fab

Despite the initial optimism, the plant never had a chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. In 1997, [[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens]] delayed phase two, and in July 1998, announced the entire facility would close by year-end, having been open for less than two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### Reasons for Closure

The North Tyneside [[the_economics_and_costs_of_building_semiconductor_fabs | fab]] was always on thin ice, primarily due to the immensely volatile DRAM market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. DRAM chips are cheap commodities, competing on price with little differentiation, and are easier to [[the_economics_and_costs_of_building_semiconductor_fabs | fab]] quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. The market is dominated by competitors, especially in Asia, with South Korea holding 40% market share and excelling in technical mastery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

[[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens]]' decision to equip the fab with older 16-megabyte memory technology was perilous; it was already going out of date by 1995, while German plants were producing 64-megabyte units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The aim was to produce older modules at a profit in a cheaper location to maximize ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

The [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductor market]] crashed in 1998, particularly in memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The price per megabyte plummeted from $27 to $4 by the time the Tyneside plant opened in 1997, and further to just $2 by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Chips that sold for $50 in 1995 were selling for just $1 in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. South Korean giants, affected by the Asian financial crisis, flooded the market to stay afloat, causing industry-wide profit collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

[[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens]] Semiconductor, which made a 109 million deutsche mark profit in the year ending September 1997, crashed to a stunning loss of 1.2 billion deutsche mark (722 million USD) by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. The semiconductor division's loss was "especially appalling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

To cut costs, [[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens]] closed the UK plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. Economically, the North Tyneside fab lacked scale, operating at only a third of the capacity of the company's Dresden plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Furthermore, it had no strong internal or external backers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. [[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens]] would not touch its German or Austrian plants, and its US, French, and Taiwanese plants were joint ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. The pro-British management within [[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens]] who championed the plant's construction lost their jobs, including the CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. The new CEO was "very pro-Germany" and implemented cost-cutting measures, refocusing on core markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

The exit was financially messy, costing nearly a quarter of a billion dollars to close, representing 45% of the division's projected loss that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. [[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens]] also had to pay back government grants, likely over 15 million pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. In August 1999, [[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens]] Semiconductor was spun off into Infineon Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

## Economic Aftermath and Subsequent Attempts

The closure of the Siemens fab meant the loss of hundreds of jobs. For a few months, rumors circulated about potential buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. In September 2000, semiconductor firm Atmel emerged, paying [[reasons_behind_siemens_semiconductor_plant_closure | Siemens]] 25 million pounds ($35 million USD) for the facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Atmel produced higher-value semiconductor products, avoiding mass commodity memory, and announced plans to invest 700 million pounds ($800 million USD) to retool the plant for flash memory and microcontroller circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. These markets were more stable than DRAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

However, the dot-com crash in 2001 impacted Atmel, which lost 31 million pounds ($45 million USD) and saw revenues decline by 23% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. The company laid off 26% of its workforce (2,600 people) and interrupted its Northeast England investment plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. While Atmel initially considered a new commitment to the fab, in 2006 it adopted a "fab light" model, leading to the sale of four fabs, including North Tyneside, in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. TSMC bought the production equipment, and the empty buildings were sold off, marking the final end of the [[rise_and_fall_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_in_northeast_england | semiconductor dream]] for the site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

## Broader Economic Consequences

The North Tyneside fab closure was not an isolated event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. 1998 alone saw the loss of 3,400 manufacturing jobs in Northeast England, with factories belonging to Electrolux and Pringle also closing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Crucially, the Fujitsu fab, which opened in 1989, also closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

The underlying "curse" of the local economy was its lack of native corporate leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. All these factory jobs were provided by companies from elsewhere that had little attachment to the place and favored their homelands when financial crises struck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. This highlights the [[economic_impacts_of_focusing_on_services | economic impacts of focusing on services]] over nurturing indigenous manufacturing leadership.

## Current Status and Future Outlook

Today, the former [[the_economics_and_costs_of_building_semiconductor_fabs | fab]] facility has been transformed into the Cobalt Business Park, hosting government offices, call centers, and regional offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

While North Tyneside and the rest of Northeast England have not returned to their past glory days, there are "green shoots" in the renewable energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. Renewable energy companies have begun investing in the region, and a growing wind industry is emerging, with projects like the Darker Bank wind farm poised to be one of the largest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This offers some [[future_prospects_and_renewable_energy_investments_in_northeast_england | positive future prospects]] for a region that has faced prolonged [[historical_economic_challenges_in_northeast_england | economic challenges]].

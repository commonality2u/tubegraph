The global financial crisis of 2008 had a profound and detrimental impact on the [[container_shipping_industrys_global_significance | shipping industry]], particularly exacerbating vulnerabilities within major carriers like [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]].

### Initial Impact and Industry Volatility
After the global financial crisis, freight rates for [[container_shipping_industrys_global_significance | shipping]] crashed dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The [[container_shipping_industrys_global_significance | shipping industry]] is highly susceptible to "whiplash issues" due to the significant fluctuations in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Demand is closely tied to macroeconomic factors like the health of the world economy, seasonality, and random shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Supply, however, is much less adjustable; liners' options for growing or shrinking capacity are not flexible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]]'s Miscalculated Expansion
Despite a recovery in 2007-2008 after several tough macroeconomic years, [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] saw an opportunity to grow and decided to invest in the future by purchasing a new round of mega-ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This decision proved to be ill-timed, as they ordered at the exact wrong moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. By November 2008, just two months after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] had committed to orders for nearly a quarter million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) worth of ships, a 40% increase in their fleet size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

### Shipping Overcapacity Crisis
The "Titanic economic slowdown" that followed the global financial crisis of 2008 sparked a severe [[container_shipping_industrys_global_significance | shipping]] overcapacity crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Trade between the United States and Asia declined by 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Major market leaders also suffered significant losses: Maersk lost $2 billion, and CMA CGM lost $889 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This oversupply cycle takes years to resolve, leading to continuous losses and soaring debt for companies in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

### [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]]'s Financial Deterioration
[[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]]'s debt escalated dramatically, from approximately 195 billion Korean Won ($165 million USD) in 2012 to 440 billion Won ($375 million USD) by 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. To manage this debt, [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] began stripping itself of its most profitable assets, including domestic and overseas terminals, liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker ship divisions, and its bulk [[container_shipping_industrys_global_significance | shipping]] division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Ultimately, only the volatile container [[container_shipping_industrys_global_significance | shipping]] line remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

### Government Intervention and Bailout Decisions
In 2016, Korea Development Bank (KDB), [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]]'s largest creditor, demanded 700 billion Won ($615 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] could only raise 500 billion Won ($440 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. This led to a critical decision point for the [[south_koreas_economic_strategies_for_shipping_industry | Korean government]] regarding a potential bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

Other countries had provided significant bailouts to their [[container_shipping_industrys_global_significance | shipping]] lines during the post-crisis period:
*   Denmark lent $6 billion to Maersk in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   Germany lent $1.8 billion to Hapag-Lloyd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.
*   France lent $660 million to CMA CGM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
*   China gave $9.5 billion to Cosco and China Shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

However, the [[south_koreas_economic_strategies_for_shipping_industry | Korean government]], through KDB, also had to deal with another troubled line, Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. While HMM was able to restructure its chartering contracts, cut debt, and receive capital injections, [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. The government's decision not to bail out [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] echoed the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. After years of supporting the industry as a core national interest, the [[south_koreas_economic_strategies_for_shipping_industry | Korean government]] decided it would no longer do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

In contrast, Taiwan's government bailed out its two container [[container_shipping_industrys_global_significance | shipping]] lines, Evergreen and Yang Ming, in late 2016, recognizing the nation's reliance on [[container_shipping_industrys_global_significance | shipping]] firms for economic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

### Consequences of [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]]'s Collapse
[[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]]'s insolvency in August 2016 caused widespread chaos in the global [[container_shipping_industrys_global_significance | shipping]] market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. One hundred fifty-nine companies found themselves unable to retrieve their cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] stopped paying terminal fees, leading to $4 billion worth of goods being stranded at sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. This included critical Korean export goods, as [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] transported 40% of Samsung's electronics and 20% of LG's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Walmart alone had 3,000 containers stranded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. The collapse also led to the annihilation of tens of thousands of shipyard jobs in both Korea and the Philippines, where [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] owned the Subic Bay Shipyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

Ultimately, [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]]'s demise stemmed from a working capital crisis, compounded by unprofitable chartering practices and the lack of financial backing from its sibling companies after the founder's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. The global financial crisis exposed these vulnerabilities and highlighted the precarious nature of the [[container_shipping_industrys_global_significance | shipping industry]] in the absence of government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. With over 1.3 trillion Korean Won ($1 billion USD) in charter fees owed, [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] declared bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>, with its last ship sold for demolition in March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

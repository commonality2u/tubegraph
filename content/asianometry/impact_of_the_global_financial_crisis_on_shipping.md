The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008 had a profound and lasting impact on the [[container_shipping_industry_dynamics | shipping industry]], leading to widespread overcapacity, crashing freight rates, and significant financial distress for major carriers worldwide.

## Hanjin Shipping's Downfall

Hanjin Shipping, once South Korea's largest container shipping line, experienced severe difficulties following the GFC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The company had been the fourth biggest container line globally in 2016, operating 97 ships and calling on 90 different ports in over 35 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, after the crisis, freight rates plummeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

In the midst of the crisis, Hanjin Shipping made a critical misstep by investing in a new round of mega-ships, following industry leaders like Maersk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. This decision proved to be ill-timed, as orders for nearly a quarter million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU), a 40% increase in their fleet size, were committed by November 2008, just two months after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

The "Titanic economic slowdown" that followed the GFC sparked a global shipping overcapacity crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Trade between the United States and Asia declined by 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. This led to significant losses across the industry, with Maersk losing $2 billion and CMA CGM losing $889 million in that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

Hanjin Shipping's debt soared from approximately $165 million USD in 2012 to $375 million USD by 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. To manage this debt, Hanjin began selling off its most profitable assets, including domestic and overseas terminals, liquefied natural gas tanker ship divisions, and bulk shipping divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Eventually, only the volatile container shipping line remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## Government Bailouts and Their Absence

In 2016, Korea Development Bank (KDB), Hanjin's largest creditor, demanded 700 billion Korean Won (approximately $615 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Hanjin could only offer 500 billion Won ($440 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

Despite other countries bailing out their shipping lines – Denmark lending $6 billion to Maersk in 2011, Germany lending $1.8 billion to Hapag-Lloyd, France $660 million to CMA CGM, and China providing $9.5 billion to Cosco and China Shipping – the [[korean_governments_decision_on_shipping_bailouts | Korean government decided]] not to bail out Hanjin Shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. This decision was influenced by KDB also dealing with Hyundai Merchant Marine, which managed to restructure its contracts and inject capital from its ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Hanjin, however, could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

The Korean government's decision not to provide a bailout, echoing the sentiment of avoiding "taxpayer money to corporate Fat Cats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, marked a shift from its long history of supporting the industry as a core national interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

## Consequences of Hanjin's Insolvency

Hanjin's August 2016 insolvency caused global chaos in the shipping market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   **Stranded Cargo:** 159 companies found their cargo unable to be moved, with $4 billion worth of goods stranded at sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This included critical Korean export goods, as Hanjin shipped 40% of Samsung's electronics and 20% of LG's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Walmart alone had 3,000 containers at sea or in terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.
*   **Supply Chain Disruption:** Hanjin stopped paying terminal fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, forcing companies like Walmart to purchase additional shipyards to store empty containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
*   **Job Losses:** The collapse annihilated tens of thousands of shipyard jobs in both Korea and the Philippines, where Hanjin owned the Subic Bay Shipyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.

In contrast, Singapore, facing a similar decision with its national champion container line Neptune Orient Lines (NOL), opted to divest itself of the industry, selling NOL to French operator CMA CGM for $2.4 billion USD shortly before Hanjin's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. The Taiwanese government, however, bailed out its two container shipping lines, Evergreen and Yang Ming, in the fourth quarter of 2016, recognizing the industry's importance to national economic development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

Ultimately, Hanjin Shipping's demise was due to a working capital crisis exacerbated by poor chartering practices, leaving it with unprofitable ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. The GFC intensified these issues, and without a "rich sibling company" to provide an undeclared bailout, unlike in 1986 when Korean Air stepped in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, and without government backing, the company declared bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. The last ship belonging to Hanjin Shipping was sold for demolition in March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

The People's Republic of Albania was known as the most isolated country in Europe [00:00:02]. This small communist nation managed to join with, and then split from, three major communist powers throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s [00:00:07]. After its final split, Albania aggressively pursued [[economic_policies_and_challenges_under_communist_rule | economic self-reliance]], which contributed to it becoming the third poorest country globally [00:00:18].

## Early Communist Rule and Alliances

Under the leadership of [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Enver Hoxha]], the Communist Party of Albania (officially the Albanian Party of Labor) came to power in November 1944 [00:08:16]. Albania was the only country in central or Eastern Europe to be "liberated" without Allied help [00:06:47]. After consolidating power through purges and sham tribunals [00:08:57], Hoxha established a "People's Republic" in 1946 [00:10:02].

Initially, Albania aligned closely with Yugoslavia, which had helped found its Communist Party [00:10:08]. Yugoslavia pushed for Albania to join the Yugoslav Federation [00:10:23]. This arrangement saw Albania supply natural resources to Yugoslavia, which then produced industrial goods to sell back at inflated prices [00:10:55]. Hoxha, however, was wary of Yugoslavia's influence and its leader, Josip Tito [00:11:07].

### Breaking with the Soviets

Hoxha's opportunity to assert independence from Yugoslavia came in 1948, when Stalin began criticizing Tito [00:11:45]. The Soviets guaranteed they would not permit a Yugoslav attack on Albania and granted Hoxha a free hand to purge pro-Yugoslav elements within the party [00:12:05]. Koci Xoxe, the Minister of the Interior and formerly the regime's number two, was arrested and executed in 1949 [00:12:16]. This period marked the beginning of Albania's closer ties with the Soviet Union [00:13:05].

Albania joined COMECON, with all its trade occurring with COMECON states between 1949 and 1951, half of which was with the Soviet Union [00:13:09]. The Soviets provided significant aid, including food, military assistance (approximately $200 million between 1948 and 1960), technology transfers, and the construction of airfields and a submarine base [00:13:21].

However, the death of Stalin in 1953 led to a shift in Soviet policy under Nikita Khrushchev [00:16:49]. Khrushchev's repudiation of the Stalin cult of personality, his embrace of collective leadership, and his policy of "different paths to socialism" (including reconciliation with Tito) grated on Hoxha [00:17:17].

Albania began shifting its alignment towards China, the other major communist power at odds with Khrushchev [00:17:37]. By 1957, Chinese aid accounted for 21.6% of Albania's total trade balance [00:17:53]. The widening Sino-Soviet Split ultimately led to Albania's break with the Soviets. In November 1960, Hoxha openly criticized Khrushchev in Moscow [00:18:11]. The Soviets responded by withdrawing their considerable aid in April 1961, which had made up 50% of Albania's economy from 1946 to 1961 [00:18:48]. At the Soviet Communist Party Congress in October 1961, Khrushchev publicly called Hoxha an "unreconstructed Stalinist" [00:19:03].

Albania was subsequently expelled from the Warsaw Pact and COMECON, leaving China as its sole significant ally [00:21:27].

### Breaking with China

China attempted to fill the void left by Soviet aid, sending technicians and advisors [00:21:50]. Mao Zedong even declared Albania "the only beacon of true socialism left in Europe" in November 1966 [00:22:14]. However, China itself was a developing country facing challenges, including a severe famine [00:22:39]. Geographical distance also caused delays in aid delivery, with machinery for a textile plant once taking 18 months to arrive [00:22:46]. This period (1961-1965), aligned with the Third Five-Year Plan, became one of the most challenging in Communist Albania's history [00:23:03].

To maintain his grip on power, Hoxha intensified his surveillance state, the Sigurimi, and further ramped up his personal cult of personality [00:23:12].

The "love affair" with China ended when China began its overtures to the West in 1969 [00:23:31]. News of US President Nixon's trip to China in July 1971 struck Albania like a "bombshell" [00:23:47]. Albania, valuing its position as China's "only real" ally, formally criticized the meeting as revisionist [00:24:04]. Further tensions arose when Tito was invited to Beijing in 1977 [00:24:21].

In July 1978, China, under Deng Xiaoping, announced it would cut off all aid to Albania, which at that time constituted half of the country's economy [00:24:41].

## The Era of Self-Reliance

With the cessation of Chinese aid, Albania intensified its focus on "self-reliance" [00:24:54]. This concept, inherent in Stalinist economies, was pushed to extremes in Albania due to its unique isolation [00:25:03]. The Albanian government proclaimed itself the only country still building socialism and revamped its Constitution in 1976 to enshrine the principle of self-reliance [00:25:30]. This meant no foreign aid or credit, and no joint ventures with foreign countries for the next 12 years [00:25:44]. Hoxha consolidated unlimited power, further elevating his cult of personality, banning religion, and forbidding foreign travel [00:25:55].

### Economic Isolation and Stagnation

The policy of [[the_isolation_and_selfreliance_of_communist_albania | economic isolation]] had several key points of emphasis:
*   **Increased Exports:** Albania ramped up exports of oil, chrome ore (chromite), copper, and electricity to acquire hard currency for needed investment goods [00:26:15]. Trade partners diversified to include a semi-relaxation of relations with Yugoslavia and COMECON states (excluding the Soviet Union) [00:26:31].
*   **Data Control:** Economic data was tightly controlled by the Central Committee, only releasing positive figures [00:26:43].
*   **Food Self-Sufficiency:** Swamps were drained to expand arable land, nearly doubling it from 391,000 hectares in 1950 to 713,000 in 1985 [00:26:56]. In 1976, Albania declared self-sufficiency in bread grain [00:27:11].

Despite Hoxha's public declarations of economic victory near the end of his life [00:28:06], the country entered a period of deep and prolonged [[soviet_economic_stagnation_and_need_for_reform | economic stagnation]]. While the CIA World Fact Book reported a slight trade surplus in 1983 and no foreign debt, the actual economic growth rate averaged only 1.7% throughout the 1980s, zeroing out in the latter half [00:28:56]. With a population growth rate of 2%, the average Albanian became poorer [00:29:32].

Several factors contributed to this decline:
*   **Drought:** A five-year drought from 1983 to 1988 severely impacted agricultural output and hydropower generation, which was crucial for exports and chromite mining [00:29:39].
*   **Oil Price Crash:** A global oil glut crashed petro-prices, damaging one of Albania's key economic pillars [00:29:57].
*   **Obsolete Equipment:** Equipment from the Soviets and Chinese was obsolete and broken. Attempts to repair it domestically under the self-reliance policy were more costly than buying new machinery from abroad [00:30:21]. Oil production targets were significantly missed, highlighting the country's backwardness [00:30:07].

The people suffered greatly under these conditions. Families were severely rationed for meat, butter, and eggs [00:30:38]. The average monthly wage in 1984 was a meager $15 [00:30:49]. Even in Tirana, the capital, water and electricity were only available for a few hours daily [00:30:57]. Technology on display was decades old [00:31:38].

The regime maintained strict control: anyone attempting to leave was shot [00:31:49], jamming devices blocked foreign influence [00:31:54], and borders were heavily fortified [00:31:57]. Approximately 1,200 people were killed trying to escape during Hoxha's 45-year rule [00:32:05].

## The Collapse of Communist Albania

[[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Enver Hoxha]] died in April 1985 [00:28:42]. His chosen successor, Ramiz Alia, began to introduce gradual changes, slowly retreating from the self-reliance philosophy [00:32:20]. Alia made quiet diplomatic overtures to the West, establishing relations with West Germany, Spain, and Canada, and relaxed some internal restrictions [00:32:32].

However, these reforms were insufficient. The Sigurimi's grip weakened [00:32:51], and by 1989, other Communist governments in Eastern Europe began to collapse [00:32:56]. In July 1990, thousands of Albanians occupied Western embassies seeking asylum [00:33:01]. Massive protests erupted in Tirana, leading to widespread violence and looting that further damaged the economy [00:33:13]. Industrial output plummeted [00:33:27].

Alia's final attempts at reform failed. To his credit, he chose not to violently suppress the protests and instead called for free elections [00:33:34]. The people tore down Hoxha's statues [00:33:48], and in March 1992, the Democratic Party won power, marking the end of Communist rule [00:33:52].

Albania's pursuit of total [[the_isolation_and_selfreliance_of_communist_albania | economic self-reliance]] ultimately led to anti-development and national decline [00:34:19]. After 1992, the country underwent one of the fastest transitions to capitalism, though a profound need for further economic reform persists today [00:34:29].

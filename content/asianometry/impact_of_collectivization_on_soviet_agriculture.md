Collectivization was a major policy initiative in the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] during the Stalin era, which fundamentally altered the agricultural landscape. It involved the replacement of individual peasant farms with collective ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:57">[06:33:57]</a>.

## Implementation and Immediate Consequences
After defeating his political enemies, Stalin discarded Lenin's New Economic Policy in 1928 and initiated the first Five-Year Plan, which included the collectivization drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. Peasants lost their land, grain, and livestock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. Resistance to collectivization was met with harsh measures, as those who resisted were exiled or executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

This policy led to widespread famines in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. The famines and the overall process of collectivization resulted in the deaths of millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.

## Economic Effects
In the view of the speaker, collectivization had "little impact on the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]]'s economic outcomes" in terms of direct agricultural productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. However, it did spur people to migrate from the countryside into cities to take jobs in the industrial sector, thereby fueling the investment drive in heavy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

Despite this labor transfer, it is suggested that collectivization "damaged the economy's other growth engines" that were actually working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. The speaker's personal view is that the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]]'s economy would have been better off without collectivization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. The issue remains controversial and debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

By the 1950s, farms in the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] were underperforming due to under-investment and poor management, with yields worse than in any other European country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. This necessitated significant capital investment into mechanization and other modernizations to produce enough food for the growing urban populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.

The [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]], despite its vast size, had relatively little farmable land compared to regions like the United States' breadbasket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. Attempts by the government to create new fertile farmlands had limited effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. One example of this "short-term thinking to meet short-term output goals" was the draining of the Aral Sea to grow cotton, which became an environmental disaster due to inefficient irrigation and lack of intelligent agricultural methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

Collectivization is cited as one of the factors contributing to the brutal political repression and horrible famines within the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.

The early years of the Compaq Computer Company were marked by incredible growth, with its first year's revenue reaching $111 million after being founded in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Compaq's revenue soared to $329 million in its second year (1984), a 200% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. By its third year, revenue hit $504 million, placing it in the Fortune 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Compaq achieved $1.2 billion in revenue by 1987, setting a historical record for the fastest company to reach that milestone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Compaq's success was largely attributed to leading an insurgency of IBM PC clone-makers against IBM, thereby opening up the PC standard to a new wave of manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

However, this very success began to introduce problems, as the revolution Compaq led eventually "turned on them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Early Strategic Engines

Compaq's initial growth was driven by several key strategic "engines":

### Product Innovation and Compatibility
Compaq's first major strategic move was offering a breakthrough product that was both compatible with and sufficiently differentiated from the original IBM PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. The Compaq Portable, while not a true laptop, was designed to be lugged around, a capability the original IBM PC lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. IBM didn't introduce its own portable until February 1984, over a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. The Portable was also cheaper, making it an appealing second computer for professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

Crucially, Compaq ensured deep compatibility with IBM's business software ecosystem, including Lotus 1-2-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. This required a "cleanroom" approach, with two teams re-implementing the IBM PC BIOS code and adhering strictly to IBM PC hardware specifications, including the keyboard layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

### Speed to Market
Compaq's second strategic advantage was its rapid product development cycle, which contrasted sharply with IBM's slow, deliberate process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. While IBM's development took 12 to 18 months, Compaq's chaotic yet efficient process took only 6 to 9 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This allowed Compaq to quickly integrate new technologies, exemplified by the iconic Deskpro 386, the first IBM PC clone with leading-edge silicon, which launched a full year before IBM's comparable offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

Compaq was also faster than competitors, including IBM, in getting products onto shelves, providing a compelling alternative to IBM's frequent stock-outs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

### Dealer-Centric Distribution
The third major strategic engine was Compaq's relationship with its dealers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Unlike IBM, which sold through its own sales force and retailers, Compaq exclusively used retailers as its distribution channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Co-founder and CEO Rod Canion emphasized "Keep the seller sold" and "A dealer done right can be the best distribution mechanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. This strategy saved money on a large sales force and fostered strong dealer loyalty, as retailers knew Compaq wouldn't compete with them on large corporate accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

## The High and Emerging Challenges
After the successful launch of the Deskpro 386, Compaq was widely admired for its success and its ability to choose the right products at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>. Business media praised Compaq's unique business style and consensus-oriented culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

Despite its success, Compaq faced a growing challenge: the commoditization of the PC market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. With the PC becoming a modular box primarily driven by Intel chips and Microsoft OS software, careful engineering became less crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. By mid-1985, components could be easily assembled with few issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. This led to a surge of "super-clones" from companies like Dell and Gateway, which were just as powerful but significantly cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. Compaq's management, including Michael Swavely, President of Compaq North America, insisted they could charge a premium for "the best machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>, but consumers paid a 67% premium for a Compaq over a similar Gateway 2000 system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

Compaq also struggled with self-generated innovation, investing only about 4% of revenues into R&D in the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. This made them beholden to critical partners like Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. Furthermore, Compaq missed opportunities in new markets; for instance, CEO Rod Canion wanted to produce a laptop in early 1984, but market research indicated the market wasn't big enough, so he set it aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. Despite Toshiba releasing a successful portable in 1986, Compaq didn't introduce its own laptop, the SLT, until October 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

## Strategic Shift and Turnaround Under Eckhard Pfeiffer (1991-1999)

In mid-1990, Compaq began facing difficulties, exacerbated by a mini-recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. Chairman Ben Rosen grew concerned about Compaq's ability to keep pace with the rapidly changing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. In May 1991, Compaq pre-announced an 81% fall in profits, causing its stock to drop 27% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>. Management, however, viewed this as a "short-term perturbation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.

After Compaq reported its first quarterly loss in years in October 1991 and announced layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>, Rosen demanded a low-end PC be produced in three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>. When Canion insisted it was impossible without sacrificing quality, Rosen revealed that two Compaq employees had secretly assembled two demo PCs from off-the-shelf parts in three days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>. Canion's continued refusal led to his firing, and Eckhard Pfeiffer stepped in as CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>.

### Pfeiffer's Volume Strategy
Pfeiffer, known for his intensity and execution skills, quickly unveiled a new strategy: focusing on volume by making millions of low-cost PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>.

His key strategic decisions included:
*   **Price War**: A few months into his tenure, Pfeiffer launched a price war, cutting prices across all Compaq products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>. By 1992, the cheapest 386 Compaq was 50% cheaper than in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:42:00">[17:42:00]</a>.
*   **New Low-Cost Products**: In June 1992, he unveiled 16 new products, including the low-cost ProLinea desktop and Contura laptop lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>. The ProLinea became Compaq's best-selling line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.
*   **Expanded Distribution**: Pfeiffer broadened distribution by signing deals with large computer superstores targeting home consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Production**: Factories in Houston, Singapore, and Erskine, Scotland ramped up to seven days a week, and a new factory was established in Shenzhen, China, to meet demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>.
*   **Presario Line**: In August 1993, Compaq introduced the Presario, an all-in-one computer line designed for home users, which became a massive hit and Compaq's new best-seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.

This turnaround was remarkably fast. In 1992, Compaq sold 150% more computers than in 1991, with revenues increasing 25% to $4.1 billion and net profits growing 63% to $213 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>. The success continued in 1993, with revenues jumping to $7 billion and profits to $867 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a>. In 1994, Compaq recorded $10.9 billion in sales, and by 1995, it reached $14.9 billion, surpassing IBM and Apple to become the world's largest PC maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:33:00">[21:33:00]</a>.

## Acquisitions and Shifting Strategy (1995-1999)

Despite becoming the largest PC maker, 1995 marked the end of easy growth, and competition, particularly from Dell, intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:00">[21:57:00]</a>. Compaq's long-standing reliance on external distributors became a weakness, as Dell's direct-selling model gained ground with the rise of the Internet, allowing them to cut margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>. Compaq couldn't easily adopt this model without alienating its partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>.

Pfeiffer believed Compaq's future lay beyond mere PCs, envisioning it as a global computer services company, aiming for $50 billion in revenue by 2000, akin to IBM's model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>. This vision led to "a series of unfortunate acquisitions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>:

*   **Networth (late 1995)**: Acquired to build a networking business to challenge Cisco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>.
*   **Microcom (May 1997)**: Another networking company acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>.
*   **Tandem Computer Incorporated (June 1997)**: Acquired for $4 billion. Tandem specialized in fault-tolerant computers for critical 24/7 services like ATM networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:47:00">[23:47:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) (January 1998)**: A record-breaking acquisition at $9.6 billion, making it the largest computer company acquisition to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>. DEC, known for inventing the minicomputer and its legendary technology prowess, had $13 billion in revenues, boosting Compaq to a $38 billion giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>. While analysts saw value in DEC's cash, tax assets, and services business, its core server and workstation businesses struggled against rivals like [[challenges_and_decline_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>. DEC also owned AltaVista, a major search engine, but Compaq did little with it beyond a vague idea to sell PCs through the site, eventually selling it to KPMG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:37:00">[25:37:00]</a>.

Pfeiffer struggled to integrate these acquisitions and leverage DEC's considerable technological assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>. All the while, Compaq's core PC business continued to deteriorate. Compaq only began adopting Dell's direct-sales model in 1998, but it was "too little, too late" to close Dell's cost advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:04:00">[26:04:00]</a>.

## End of Pfeiffer and Acquisition by HP (1999-2002)

In April 1999, Ben Rosen and the board fired Eckhard Pfeiffer, citing his focus on revenue numbers, expensive acquisition spree, and inability to integrate the acquired companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:24:00">[26:24:00]</a>. Michael Capellas, Compaq's Chief Information Officer, was chosen as the new CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:54:00">[26:54:00]</a>. Despite efforts to improve finances and gain traction with direct selling, the core PC business continued to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:09:00">[27:09:00]</a>. In September 1999, Dell overtook Compaq as the leading PC seller in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:26:00">[27:26:00]</a>.

By 2001, Compaq's board asked Capellas to explore a possible merger due to a bad year, exacerbated by the bursting Dotcom bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:34:00">[29:34:00]</a>. Hewlett-Packard (HP), also struggling with the commoditization of the PC business, was looking to remake itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[27:37:00]</a>. Carly Fiorina, HP's CEO, was tasked with transforming HP into new businesses like information system services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:10:00">[29:10:00]</a>.

On September 3, 2001, HP agreed to acquire Compaq in a stock swap worth about $25 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>. Fiorina would continue to lead the combined entity, which boasted $87 billion in revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:21:00">[30:21:00]</a>. The deal aimed to leverage complementary product lines and Compaq's growing direct sales programs, anticipating about $4 billion in savings through 15,000 job cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:36:00">[30:36:00]</a>.

Despite initial investor skepticism and opposition from Walter Hewlett, the merger ultimately gained shareholder approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:58:00">[30:58:00]</a>. While Fiorina was later dropped as CEO in 2005, her successor, Mark Hurd, oversaw significant cost cuts and growth, leading the combined company to over $110 billion in revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>. The Compaq brand was phased out soon after the acquisition, though it remained on some low-end computers until 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:22:00">[32:22:00]</a>.

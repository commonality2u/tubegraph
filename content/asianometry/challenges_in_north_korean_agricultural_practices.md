The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), or North Korea, has long pursued [[north_koreas_agricultural_selfsufficiency_efforts | self-sufficiency in food production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. Reliable information about the country's agricultural situation is difficult to obtain, as official government channels are not always credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Geographical and Climatic Factors

Historically, the northern part of Korea was its industrial heartland, while the south served as its breadbasket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This specialization is reflected in North Korea's geography, where 80% of its land is mountainous with deep valleys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The majority of the country's 25 million people reside on the coastal plains and lowlands of the west <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Only about 15% of North Korea's land is arable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, which is higher than the global average of 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Most farms are situated on the west coast due to more favorable land, weather, and growing seasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The cropping season is short, with harsh winters, and short, hot, humid, and rainy summers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Approximately 60% of the DPRK's rain falls between June and September, making the country vulnerable to droughts and floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. These extreme climate events are exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure and deforestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Historical Context of Agricultural Policy

At its founding, the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) inherited an industrialized society from the Japanese occupation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. North Korea held 72% of the peninsula's industrial capacity and over 90% of its hydroelectric capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The ruling WPK seized much of this industrial capacity, along with land from Korean landlords and Japanese colonialists, redistributing it to the peasantry between 1945 and 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

However, the Korean War (1950-1953) devastated the peninsula, causing population upheaval and annihilating industrial infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. After the war, North Korea sought aid and guidance from China and the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Central Planning and Collectivization
Domestically, the DPRK adopted a centrally planned economy, patterned after the Soviet Union, to suppress markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The state owned all businesses and provided all jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. All land was seized, and two types of farms were established: cooperatives and state farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Farmers were restricted to working on these collective farms, with the state owning all food grown for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

Eternal leader Kim Il-sung pushed for this [[impact_of_collectivization_on_soviet_agriculture | collectivization]] to achieve [[north_koreas_agricultural_selfsufficiency_efforts | self-reliance in food production]], aligning with the country's official state ideology of political independence and self-reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This drive for collectivization, criticized even by other communist bloc countries, led to food shortages in the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. In response, the government heavily promoted the use of fertilizers, pesticides, tractors, and irrigation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. While yields stabilized, the agricultural sector became dangerously dependent on raw inputs like oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### External Dependencies and Economic Decline
Over the years, North Korea accrued vast debts to its main benefactors, the Soviet Union and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. These unpaid debts led to the Soviets withdrawing various subsidies in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. That same year, the DPRK implemented a range of [[north_korean_economic_and_agricultural_reforms | new agricultural reforms]], emphasizing double cropping and fertilizers to expand arable land by raising forests, reclaiming tidal land, and clearing hillsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. These intense practices resulted in soil depletion, acidification, and the use of marginal land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 severed North Korea's main supply of coal, oil, and steel, which had accounted for up to two-thirds of its two-way trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The loss of oil significantly hampered fertilizer production and irrigation infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. North Korea then turned to China, which by 1993, supplied 77% of its fuel and 68% of its food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. However, China began experiencing its own grain issues in 1994 and reduced trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## The Famine of the 1990s

North Korean radio broadcasts began admitting the existence of hunger in 1994, though denying its seriousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Studies of mortality rates imply that certain provinces had already experienced famine conditions by 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Rations were delayed or suspended in 1993, and by 1994, food shipments to four provinces were entirely cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. In 1995, the government began coercive grain seizures from farms and established prison camps for those caught foraging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Refugees from hard-hit provinces flowed into China, leading to horrific media reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

The famine was exacerbated by significant flooding in 1995 and 1996 in the country's four western provinces, where most farms are located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The floods destroyed terraces and silted fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The North Korean government claimed 5 million people displaced, over 1 million tons of grain lost, and an estimated $15 billion in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. While the floods were severe, the government likely exaggerated the extent of the damage, as food shortages existed well before the floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. For instance, a UN survey counted only 500,000 displaced people instead of 5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Exaggerating the damage allowed the government to save face while requesting aid from South Korea or Japan and deflecting criticism of its governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

International food aid helped, but not all of it reached those most in need, leading many charitable organizations to withdraw due to disputes and lack of accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. The exact scale of the famine, including the number of deaths (estimates range from 220,000 to 3.5 million), and its precise start and end dates remain uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Recent Agricultural Reforms and Challenges

Agricultural production has improved since the 1990s due to [[role_of_international_aid_and_markets_in_north_koreas_food_security | international aid]], favorable weather, and [[north_korean_economic_and_agricultural_reforms | economic reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Much of the current understanding of North Korea's agricultural situation comes from international aid programs operating in the country since at least 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

After the famine, the government permitted households to own and cultivate private plots, where they grow potatoes, corn, and vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. These privately owned gardens are well-cared for and have significantly improved the country's food security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

In 2012, the Kim Jong-un government implemented economic policy changes to devolve more authority to lower levels, allowing workers on collective farms to make more decisions regarding material and investment planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. While not as extensive as China's agricultural reforms under Deng Xiaoping, this marked a step forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. However, the extent and impact of these reforms on actual statistics remain unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Soil Quality Deterioration
A major concern in North Korean agriculture is deteriorating soil quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Unlike modern conservation agriculture practices that advocate for diversified crop rotations, organic soil cover, and minimum soil disturbance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, North Korean farmers aggressively plow and till their soil and apply large amounts of chemical fertilizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This has led to soil acidification, interfering with the soil's ability to absorb air and water and plants' nutrient uptake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

Aggressive double cropping, planting multiple crops in the same area or crop year, has further deteriorated the land's capacity to cultivate food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. The soils often have a reddish hue due to a lack of organic matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. For example, in 2011, the average yield of paddy rice was 3.9 tons per hectare, significantly down from 8.0 tons in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

To preserve soil quality, farmers should rotate in legumes, which improve soil fertility by increasing nitrogen and water retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. However, North Korean farmers are reluctant to implement legume-based cropping schemes due to fears of not meeting government-set wheat production goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This situation is unlikely to change as long as agricultural goals are dictated from above <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

### Technology and Infrastructure
North Korean farmers suffer from a long-standing lack of adequate farming technology, such as tractors suited for the country's smaller, irregularly shaped fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Even when technology is available, farmers often cannot run or maintain it due to shortages of energy or parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. This prevents farmers from maximizing their efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. While donations help, the country's inability to raise funds for these items is a significant barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

North Korea blames the United States and its trade sanctions for these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. However, the Export Control Act (1940) and the Trading with the Enemy Act (1917) predated North Korea's existence as a state, and North Korea was removed from the latter's restrictions in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Furthermore, both China and the Soviet Union independently reduced support and aid to North Korea, a country notorious for being a deadbeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

### Deforestation and its Consequences
Over the past few decades, the North Korean government has intensely tried to expand its arable land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. As the best land was already cultivated, these efforts largely involved cutting down trees on hillsides to create terraces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. During the "great famine," cultivation was even allowed on lands with slopes above 15%, despite their poor soil quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Satellite imagery indicates that one million hectares of land on slopes above 10 degrees have been cleared for growing cereals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

Given that much of the country is mountainous and prone to unpredictable rainfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, removing trees, which hold down soil, easily leads to soil erosion and silting during heavy rainstorms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. This not only damages growing capacity but also makes floods more dangerous to people and property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Floods have been noticeably more destructive since the 1980s, correlating with the onset of these deforestation efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Deforestation also impacts the population's ability to generate energy, as 77% of the rural population and 28% of the urban population rely on wood for cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

## Food Distribution and Markets

Nobel Prize winner Amartya Sen observed that famines occur not only due to crop failures but also due to collapses in food distribution networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. During the DPRK's central planning era, the state collected all harvests and distributed food rations to households based on occupation and size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

During the famine, even when food was available, oil shortages made distribution difficult, leading to the collapse of the old food rationing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Ordinary North Koreans then resorted to illegal private markets to access food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. These "black markets" were predominantly run by women, primarily housewives trying to sustain their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

After the famine subsided, the government initially attempted to crack down on these markets but eventually formalized them, providing housing, facilities, and even security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Though the government avoided calling it "market reform," that is essentially what it was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Today, defector surveys suggest that most ordinary North Koreans obtain their food from these markets and private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

The government has also tried to revitalize the old food ration system, but its current extent is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. While defectors report no longer receiving rations, the state still takes up to 70% of state farmers' annual harvests for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. It is likely that these rations are now directed primarily to the country's political and economic elites to secure their support for the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

## Government Policy and Future Outlook

The North Korean government's budget and resources have significantly depleted over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Kim Jong-un views the reform and revitalization of the agricultural sector as a core policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>, repeatedly stating in speeches that he wants to improve people's lives through increased food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. However, his government has been short on concrete policy solutions, often offering vague concepts like a "seed revolution" or reiterating existing practices like double cropping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

While food distribution has improved and famine is no longer a major threat, North Korea's agricultural situation still falls short of [[north_koreas_agricultural_selfsufficiency_efforts | self-sufficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. The country's farms have endured significant abuse and soil damage over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. The proposed solutions are insufficient to address the fundamental agricultural problems that need to change before North Koreans can consistently have enough food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

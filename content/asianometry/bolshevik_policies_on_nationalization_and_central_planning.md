From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The early Soviet Union, under Bolshevik rule, embarked on a radical experiment to create a society without money, believing it was a necessary step towards an ideal socialist utopia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This period, known as War Communism, involved extensive nationalization and centralized economic control, despite resulting in a devastating economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | economic history of the Soviet Union]] began with this fascinating but ultimately disastrous [[rise_and_decline_of_soviet_economic_strategies | economic strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Marxist Influence on Policy

Karl Marx believed that money was not a neutral facilitator of trade but contributed to cyclical booms and busts in capitalist economies through hoarding and overproduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. He also viewed money as the mechanism through which the bourgeoisie exploited the working class, leading to alienation from their valuable outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Marx envisioned that in a centrally planned socialist society, money would become unnecessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This notion of eliminating money was widespread among the Bolsheviks, who saw it as a major facet of the new economy they aimed to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Economic Context at the Revolution

When the Bolsheviks seized power in 1917, Russia was already in a dire state due to World War I. The Imperial government had abandoned the gold standard in June 1914, leading to massive deficits (39% in the first year, 75% in subsequent years) funded by printing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This resulted in collapses in economic output and high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. By early 1917, paper rubles in circulation had increased 5.5 times from July 1914 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The government's 1917 deficit was 82% of its budget, with 73% financed by the printing press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918 further exacerbated the [[economic_challenges_of_early_soviet_union | economic challenges of the early Soviet Union]], costing Russia a third of its population, nearly a third of its agricultural land, and over half of its industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Key resources like oil wells (97% of total output) and Ukrainian coal, iron ore, and grain (74-80% of Russian Empire totals) became inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. The Russian Civil War further plunged the country into chaos, with anti-Bolshevik forces occupying territories and disrupting economic activity until 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Russia was a semi-industrialized, largely agricultural society, far from ideal for an immediate transition to socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Centralization and Nationalization Efforts

Despite the dire circumstances, the Bolsheviks pressed forward with their plan for a new socialist economy, as outlined by Lenin in "The Immediate Tasks of Soviet Rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The party announced its intention to establish the "dictatorship of the proletariat" and centralize all economic activities into a single national plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### Banking Nationalization

Recognizing that banks controlled money and thus power in a capitalist society, the Bolsheviks declared a state monopoly on all banking activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The *Communist Manifesto* listed the establishment of a single central bank as the first step towards centralizing the means of production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. With just 12 banks holding 80% of Russia's capital, nationalization was swift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

On November 20, 1917, the People's Commissar of Finance seized the Russian State Bank (Gosbank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Private banks were ordered to fund worker-controlled factories, and upon their refusal, troops occupied the largest banks in December 1917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Their capital was transferred to Gosbank, dividends were abolished, withdrawals restricted, and all foreign debts canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. By the end of 1918, all banks were liquidated and merged into Gosbank, which ceased to lend money but instead kept accounts of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This nationalization severely restricted credit, leading to the closure of 405 enterprises in the first quarter of 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Industrial Nationalization

In June 1918, the Council of the People's Commissar announced the nationalization of industry, seen as "pulling out and cutting the wires through which the capitalists controlled the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Railways, shipping, and mining were nationalized throughout late 1918 and early 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Lenin aimed for firm central control, but the process was chaotic, with less than 14% of nationalizations handled by the central government; the majority were performed by local organizations and trade unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This chaos led to the ejection of many skilled workers and business owners, whose replacements often lacked the expertise to operate the industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## War Communism and Its Consequences

The ongoing Russian Civil War (summer 1918 - end 1919) further intensified the Bolsheviks' policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. All efforts were dedicated to supplying the Red Army, utilizing every available laborer and resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The government's treasury was strained, and without foreign loans (due to repudiated debts and nationalized assets), they relied heavily on the printing press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Taxation was minimal, with income taxes providing only 7.3% of spending in 1918, forcing them to raise indirect taxes despite prior promises to abolish them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### Hyperinflation and Food Policy

This reliance on printing money led to rampant [[hyperinflation_and_economic_crisis_in_soviet_russia | hyperinflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. By the end of 1918, inflation reached 598%, with over 60 billion rubles in circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The ruble's value plummeted, falling by a tenth from 1917 to 1918 when measured against 1913 values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

The government's priority was ensuring food supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. They continued the Tsarist government's grain monopoly, which prohibited private grain trading and required farmers to deliver surpluses to the state at fixed prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. However, the crashing ruble devalued these fixed prices, leading peasants to refuse to sell their goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. The Bolsheviks, viewing the problem as one of distribution rather than production, responded with "requisitioning" food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. In May 1918, a "food dictatorship" was announced, permitting the use of armed force to seize food from peasants suspected of hiding it, further disincentivizing surplus production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

By May 1919, the People's Bank was printing money "as much as possible," leading to inflation of 1,376% in 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Money printing costs consumed 45-60% of the mint's budget in the second half of 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Amazingly, the Bolsheviks argued that this hyperinflation was a sign that their socialist transformation was working, believing that devaluing money to nothing would annihilate the power of the wealthy and lead to a moneyless system of state distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

### Post-Civil War Intensification and Collapse

After the Red Army essentially won the Civil War around April 1920, the Bolsheviks gained confidence to intensify their "economic War" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. They sought to take over the entire supply and distribution system, passing legislation to make public services like transportation, telegraph, medicines, food, consumer goods, fuel, and postage free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Private trade and money were to be banished, with the government controlling all inputs and outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Taxes and wages were increasingly paid in kind, meaning physical goods rather than cash, accounting for 93% of wages by 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Discussions for new accounting units, such as a "tread" (a day of simple labor), emerged but proved confusing and impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

Despite printing 16.3 trillion new rubles in 1921, the government still ran a deficit of 21.9 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. In 1922, issuance swelled to 1.97 quadrillion new rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

By 1921, the catastrophic effects of War Communism were undeniable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. The Russian economy was in ruins:
*   The state was unprepared for centralized control over all items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   Illegal markets flourished, supplying most people's food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.
*   Production of items like steel, sugar, and bricks virtually ceased, with overall industrial production falling to a third of pre-war levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
*   The lack of money created a total lack of incentive to work, leading to high desertion rates (e.g., 40% in railways) and dramatically reduced worker productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   Daily caloric intake fell by 30% from the 1910s average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.
*   A devastating famine in 1921-1922 resulted in 5 million deaths, exacerbated by food requisitioning that left peasants with no reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

The widespread peasant revolts, notably the Kronstadt Rebellion in 1921, forced Lenin to reassess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## Reversal of Course: The New Economic Policy (NEP)

Recognizing the failure, Lenin concluded that market activity had to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. In March 1921, the New Economic Policy (NEP) was implemented to reverse the decline, grow output, and stabilize the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. By 1923, despite issuing 176.5 quintillion new rubles, the Soviet government fully reversed course, introducing a gold-backed currency, making the Central Bank independent, and rebalancing the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. This period of [[soviet_economic_stagnation_and_need_for_reform | reform]] led to output recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

Lenin acknowledged their error, stating, "Life has shown how wrong we were" in relying on enthusiasm to accomplish economic tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. While he attributed the mistakes to the Civil War, the state's clear intention during War Communism was to tear the country away from capitalism, create a trade monopoly, and eradicate money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. These policies ultimately led to chaos, violence, and a "total crisis level collapse in production" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

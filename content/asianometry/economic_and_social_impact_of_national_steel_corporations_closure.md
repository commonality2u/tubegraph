National Steel Corporation (NSC) was once considered the pride of Philippine industry, one of the country's largest companies, and a rare example of a well-run government-owned enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Over two decades, it employed over 4,000 workers in Iligan City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. However, a confluence of factors led to its decline and failure by 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, resulting in significant economic and social repercussions.

## Economic Impact

The closure of NSC had a profound economic impact, both directly on its employees and the city, and indirectly on supporting industries.

### Direct Economic Consequences

*   **Job Losses:** By November 1999, the company ceased operations, leading to 1,800 remaining employees losing their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. This followed earlier layoffs in 1995, the first since 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Employees also took early retirement buyouts, further stretching the company's coffers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   **Loss of City Revenues:** NSC was a major contributor to Iligan City's finances, providing up to 75% of its total revenues throughout the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Following the closure, city revenues dropped by 72 million pesos in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Creditor and Supplier Relations:** Due to the [[privatization_and_mismanagement_of_national_steel_corporation | company's financial struggles]] and the peso devaluation during the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, NSC's U.S. dollar-denominated loans and raw materials became extremely expensive, causing creditors and suppliers to end their relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Broader Economic Repercussions

*   **Impact on Supporting Businesses:** The decline and fall of NSC reverberated across Iligan City and its major industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. Losses to supporting businesses were estimated at 1.4 billion pesos per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Affected Industries:** Local scrap metal collectors, service contractors, and the power utility suffered the heaviest losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
*   **Parallel to Other Industries:** The situation with NSC was not isolated. [[impact_of_foreign_competition_on_philippine_steel_companies | Cheap imports]], such as Indonesian and Taiwanese cement, similarly led to the closure of various domestic cement plants across the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. While imports contributed to the decline of NSC's core markets, the company was still profitable into 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Ultimately, the company's downfall was attributed to falling into the hands of an incompetent management team before suffering an unprecedented financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

## Social Impact

The closure deeply affected the social fabric of Iligan City, particularly the lives of NSC employees.

*   **Loss of Employee Benefits and Status:** NSC was known for being a generous patron of Iligan City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. It provided ample healthcare and housing benefits to its 4,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The lowest basic salary was 4,000 pesos a month, significantly higher than the average hourly wage of 9 to 20 pesos at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Employees also received 10 to 15 annual salary increases, mid-year bonuses, year-end bonuses, and sick leave monetization benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Erosion of "Steel Towner" Identity:** NSC employees were described as "steel towners," members of a "high-class village" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. They were proud to be NSC workers, with employee turnover remaining below one percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. The year 1995, when the company was sold to Wintek Holdings, is marked by many employees as "the end of life as they knew it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, signifying a deep loss of stability and social standing.

## Failed Revival Attempts and Current Status

After its closure, attempts were made to revive NSC.

*   **Global Steel Philippines Inc. (GSPI):** In 2004, an Indian group formed Global Steel Philippines Inc. (GSPI) to purchase NSC's plant assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. These investor groups were connected to Mittal Steel (today, ArcelorMittal), one of the world's largest steel companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, suggesting legitimate experience in steelmaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **Subsequent Failure:** Despite this, GSPI failed to take off. It produced and shipped some flat steel but far below its total capacity due to a chronic lack of funds. GSPI unsuccessfully sought additional support from the national government and faced an adversarial relationship with the local community and government, leading to another closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Present Day:** From time to time, proposals for revival emerge, but none have succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. Today, the 145-hectare plant and its adjacent 600-unit housing complex in Iligan City sits unused, most recently serving as a quarantine center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, serving as a reminder of what could have been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

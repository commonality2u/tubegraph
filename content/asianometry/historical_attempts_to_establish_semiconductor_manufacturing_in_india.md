India is a global powerhouse in semiconductor design, with almost every major semiconductor company maintaining a presence in the country to design advanced chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, once these designs are complete, they are sent abroad for fabrication to countries like the United States, China, South Korea, or Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite early promising starts, [[government_efforts_and_obstacles_in_reviving_indias_semiconductor_industry | India's entire semiconductor manufacturing industry]] has faced significant [[challenges_in_indias_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenges]] and has not recovered from a major setback in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Early Attempts and the Founding of SCL

In the 1960s, Western electronics companies began relocating outsourced factories to East Asia, which helped many East Asian semiconductor industries establish themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Fairchild Semiconductor, for instance, considered India for a factory in the mid-1960s but was deterred by the formidable Indian bureaucracy, opting instead for Malaysia and the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Recognizing the accelerating pace of technology in the 1970s and 1980s, the Indian government identified microprocessors and semiconductors as a potential foundation for a new revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Following the lead of nations like China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, and Singapore, India attempted to create its own semiconductor manufacturing national champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

In 1984, the Indian government founded Semiconductor Complex Limited (SCL), a 100% state-owned integrated device manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. SCL's vision was to design and manufacture leading-edge circuits and electronics, forming the bedrock of a native Indian electronics industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The government invested between $40 million and $70 million USD into the venture, a substantial sum at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. SCL was headquartered in Mohali, Punjab, an emerging electronics industry center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

SCL recruited talented young graduates from top technical universities like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) and the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, which have strong links to Western institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. They also drew talent from established Indian electronics companies such as Bharat Electronics Limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This pool of skilled engineering talent was one of [[indias_design_capabilities_in_the_semiconductor_industry | India's strengths]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Key Factors for Semiconductor Manufacturing Success

Successful high-performing semiconductor factories require four key elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>:
*   **Financial Capital:** Significant funds are needed for expensive manufacturing equipment (photolithography, chip testing), and for ongoing upgrades and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. All such equipment for SCL had to be imported from Europe or Japan, incurring import duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Human Capital:** Smart, well-educated people are essential to run the fabrication facilities, including skilled labor to operate equipment and PhDs for R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. India was strong in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Government/Infrastructure Support:** Substantial government buy-in is critical, alongside stable power and water supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The manufacturing process is also quite toxic, raising environmental concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. While government buy-in existed, India faced [[challenges_in_indias_semiconductor_manufacturing | infrastructure challenges]], where a single power outage or water shortage could ruin months of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Technology:** To catch up, acquiring older process node technology through technology transfer deals is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. These agreements are typically for older processes, as leading companies closely guard their advanced technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### SCL's Initial Technological Progress

At its founding in 1984, SCL licensed a 5-micron process technology from American Microsystems Inc. (AMI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. SCL then acquired technology from Rockwell, for manufacturing their 2560g microprocessor, and Hitachi, for producing electronic wristwatch components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The company also performed third-party assembly, notably for the BBC Acorn computer used in the Indian government's computer literacy program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

These technology transfer agreements enabled SCL personnel to receive in-person training in the U.S. and Japan, which they disseminated within the company and augmented with university academic partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Through these efforts, SCL rapidly advanced from the 5-micron process to a 0.8-micron process by the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This put SCL just one [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | semiconductor generation]] behind leading companies like NTT, Toshiba, and Intel, which achieved 0.8 microns (800 nanometers) in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. It seemed possible that India could become a global semiconductor manufacturer within a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## The 1989 Fire and Its Consequences

These hopes were dashed in 1989 when a devastating fire broke out at SCL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The cause remains unknown, though some unconfirmed claims suggest arson, possibly due to SCL's military processor work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. However, semiconductor fires are not uncommon, being a frequent cause of operational losses in the industry due to flammable chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

The fire caused severe damage, releasing toxic and corrosive gases and triggering water sprinklers, leading to further destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Production at SCL did not restart until 1997—eight years later—and required substantial financial investment, well over $50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. During this period, new entrants like TSMC (founded 1987) and Samsung rapidly advanced, capturing critical global market share and scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. India lost an immense amount of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## SCL's Decline and Restructuring

After the fire, the government pursued several failed proposals to recover lost ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Attempts to sell the fabrication plant to private investors failed due to disagreements on terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. A retooling of the fab from telephone exchange chips to smart card chips also did not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Finally, in 2005, SCL was restructured and renamed Semiconductor Laboratory (SCL), becoming an R&D center within the Department of Space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This ended SCL's aspirations as a competitive commercial entity. The company had long been out of the race, relying heavily on government contracts, and its offerings were not competitive even within the domestic Indian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Without economies of scale, SCL struggled to attract profit, even with a captive government customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. For example, in 2005-2006, SCL produced only 1,000 6-inch wafers despite having 20 times that installed capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. In its final year as a commercial company (2005-2006), SCL recorded a $2 million USD loss on $3.5 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

## SCL's Current State and Ongoing Challenges

Today, SCL primarily performs R&D work using its old 6-inch wafer fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. In 2019, SCL announced it could accept chip designs at the 180-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. While this is far from the [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | leading edge]], there are still viable commercial uses for higher-node semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a> (e.g., SkyWater Technologies runs a 130-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>).

However, the critical issue is SCL's extremely sluggish development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. It took SCL nearly a decade to reach the 180-nanometer node, having worked on it since at least 2011 when they acquired a fabrication unit from TowerJazz Semiconductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

Even before the 1989 fire, SCL faced financial strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. The costs of advancing to 800 nanometers forced them to drop the BBC Acorn computer project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Additionally, talented SCL personnel frequently left for better jobs in the private sector or abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

## The Overwhelming Cost of Modern Semiconductor Manufacturing

For India, the sheer amount of capital required to build competitive and productive fabs has been identified as the single most significant obstacle to establishing a viable semiconductor manufacturing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Today's [[government_subsidies_and_investments_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | leading-edge chip factories]] can cost tens of billions of dollars, a trend that accelerated significantly around the 14-nanometer node generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This financial burden is challenging even for India's largest private entities like Tata and Reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. For context, TSMC spends $20 billion on a single "gigafab" over two years, while Reliance Jio spent $15 billion on its nationwide LTE network over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. This massive investment must generate returns in the volatile electronics market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## Subsequent Failed Initiatives to Revive Manufacturing

Despite these [[challenges_in_indias_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenges]], the Indian government has continued to attempt to revive the country's semiconductor manufacturing efforts, though all have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>:

*   **2006 Fab City Project:** A $3 billion project was announced for manufacturing. AMD had initially been interested in establishing an assembly and test facility there, but poor industry conditions led to its closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **2013 Customs Duties Lifted:** The government lifted custom duties on all imports of parts and machinery related to semiconductor manufacturing, but this did not stimulate any foundry efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **2014 Investor Group Proposals:** India approved proposals from two investor groups to build fabs, costing about $10 billion in total. The government offered significant financial support, including 25% of the total cost, interest-free loans, tax breaks, and subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
    *   The first consortium included Jai Prakash (JP) Associates, Israel's TowerJazz, and IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. In 2016, JP Associates, a large Indian conglomerate, withdrew due to debt and the plant not being commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
    *   The second consortium was led by Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (HSMC), with expertise from European chipmaker STMicroelectronics and Malaysian state operator Siltera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This team also failed to pan out; in 2019, the government canceled HSMC's letter of intent because the consortium failed to submit necessary commitment documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. A year later, another company named HSMC (Hongshing Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) in Wuhan, China, also faced a similar lack of execution, compounded by a pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>, highlighting common [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | challenges]] in the industry.

Since these attempts, no serious Indian proposal for semiconductor manufacturing has emerged, despite current market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## Consequences of Lacking Fabrication Capacity

While [[indias_design_capabilities_in_the_semiconductor_industry | India retains world-class chip design capabilities]], with tens of thousands of engineers working in VLSI design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, SCL's failure to become a self-sustaining commercial entity has had long-term consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Today, India possesses hardly any substantial semiconductor fabrication capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Currently, 100% of India's chips—logic, memory, and all others—must be imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

In 2019, India imported $21 billion worth of semiconductors, a number growing by about 15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. In 2020, India was severely impacted by the [[the_impact_of_global_semiconductor_supply_chain_issues_on_india | worldwide semiconductor shortage]], disrupting critical Indian businesses like its position as the world's second-largest smartphone maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Furthermore, a significant portion of these imports—37% or $7 billion in 2019—originate from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. This creates critical geopolitical repercussions given the tense Sino-Indian relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

In conclusion, while India has no shortage of ideas or human talent to bring semiconductor manufacturing back, consistent, long-term direction from the highest levels of government and substantial financial commitment are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. The market has long passed the point where a private entity can establish a thriving semiconductor manufacturing industry without significant government assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

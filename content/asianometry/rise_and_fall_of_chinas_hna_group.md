From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

At its peak, China's [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] managed an estimated $170 billion in assets worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This conglomerate held significant shares in Deutsche Bank and Hilton Hotels, owned airports and real estate in Germany, China, and the United States, and operated the world's third-largest aircraft leasing business with over 900 planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Most of this growth occurred within just a few years, with the company undertaking at least one multi-million or even billion-dollar transaction monthly by May 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. However, this rapid ascent was followed by an equally swift collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Early History and Founding

Chinese companies are often characterized by their obscure early histories and opaque ownership structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Hainan, a southern Chinese island, became its own province and was designated a Special Economic Zone in 1988 to attract investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. In the same year, the central Chinese government began deregulating its airline industry, restructuring the national airline monopoly into six individual airlines and allowing private-public partnerships for regional carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The Hainan government contributed 10 million RMB (approximately $1.4 million) to establish Hainan Provincial Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. However, the company made no progress until Tan Feng, a former People's Liberation Army Air Force member and civil aviation regulator, was recruited to manage it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Tan Feng, who met co-founder Wang Jian at the civil aviation regulator, found the initial capital insufficient to operate an airline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

In 1993, Hainan Provincial Airlines restructured as a joint-stock company, allowing private individuals to hold shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Share sales raised 250 million RMB (about $35 million) from 122 stakeholders, and the airline began operations that May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. In its early days, [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] established a dual-chairman structure: Wang Jian managed internal affairs and strategy, while Tan Feng handled external communications and fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Financial Strategies: "One Plane, Two Mortgage"

Initially, the $35 million raised was insufficient for airline operations, so Tan Feng secured an additional 600 million RMB ($84 million) from banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Early Chinese banks lacked understanding of mortgage principles, assigning property rights of purchased planes to [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] rather than claiming them as collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This allowed [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] to re-mortgage purchased planes to other banks for more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

[[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] also employed a tactic of borrowing against future revenue streams from a plane's air routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This "one plane, two mortgage" approach allowed them to double their leverage and grow rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Often, the only way to repay existing loans was to take out new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### George Soros's Investment

In 1995, Tan Feng pitched Hainan's development prospects and China's airline market potential to George Soros's Quantum Fund in New York City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Soros invested $25 million, marking the first Chinese-American joint venture in China's aviation sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This investment and Soros's reputation significantly boosted the startup airline's image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. When Hainan Airlines listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the Quantum Fund's vehicle, American Aviation LDC, was reported as its largest shareholder with 21% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Soros doubled his investment to $50 million in 2005, acquiring a 10% stake in an unlisted [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] unit, with total ownership eventually valued at $110 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The Quantum Fund sold its stake in 2011, partly due to [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]]'s lack of corporate transparency and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Corporate Structure and Transparency Issues

[[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]]'s ownership structure remained famously complicated and opaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. At the IPO, co-founders Tan Feng and Wang Jian held minimal personal stakes, but controlled a shell company that was the second-largest shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

From 2002 to 2015, [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]]'s controlling shareholder was a Hainan Airlines Trade Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This was later replaced by the Hainan Tahang Charity Foundation, a non-profit established by [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] in 2000 with a 20 million RMB share donation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This foundation, despite its stated anti-poverty mission, appeared to do little beyond employing company friends and family, leading to speculation that it was a "stealth vehicle" for Tan Feng to control the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Family members of the co-founders also profited significantly: Tan Feng's brother established an American firm to supply aircraft parts, and Wang Jian's brother, Wang Wei, became a billionaire by building high-end villas and a golf course for the company in Haikou <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Consolidation and Challenges

In 1997, Hainan Provincial Airlines rebranded as Hainan Airlines, establishing Hainan [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] Holdings the following year, which would become the predecessor of [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

By the late 1990s, China's airline industry was fragmented, with over 30 carriers losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. In 2000, China's Civil Air regulator reorganized state-owned aviation companies into an oligopoly of three major airlines: Air China, Eastern, and China Southern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Hainan Airlines, with 31 planes, was too small to compete, so it merged with three smaller airlines: China Xinhua Airlines, Chang An Airlines, and Shanxi Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. China Xinhua Airlines was particularly crucial, operating from Beijing's airports and flying over 80 routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. In April 2001, Xinhua, burdened by 98% debt ratios, sold itself to [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] for about 1 billion RMB, mostly in real assets like planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. The new four-way entity focused on short- and medium-range flights to China's regional cities, turning a profit in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### SARS Epidemic (2003)

The first SARS epidemic in 2003 severely impacted the air and travel industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]], already financially stretched from acquisitions, incurred a massive loss of 1.5 billion RMB and neared [[bankruptcy_and_restructuring_of_hna_group|bankruptcy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. The Hainan provincial government, despite its small stake, bailed out the company in 2005 with a 1.5 billion RMB injection, representing 10% of its entire revenue that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

Hainan's reputation as a vacation destination grew after SARS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] strategically positioned itself to benefit from this tourism boom: over 40% of arrivals to Hainan came on Hainan Airlines planes, landing at [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]]-owned airports, staying at [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]]-owned hotels, and using [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]]-owned travel agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This vertical integration showcased their ambition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### Global Financial Crisis (2008)

The 2008 Global Financial Crisis caused [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] to suffer a 1.73 billion RMB loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. An attempt to IPO their subsidiary, Grand Air China, on the Hong Kong stock market was infeasible due to the difficult financial market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

The company survived thanks to another 1.5 billion RMB injection from the Hainan provincial government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Additionally, the Chinese government's 4 trillion RMB stimulus package in November 2008 led to skyrocketing land prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] benefited immensely from holding onto 9,000 acres of downtown Haikou land acquired when it bought Haikou Airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. This valuable land allowed [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] to sell 4 billion RMB of bonds and 2.8 billion RMB of stock, ending the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

[[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] also recovered by moving company assets between subsidiaries at favorable prices to generate paper profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. For example, in 2007, subsidiaries transferred their Beijing HQ (KoHang Building) to [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] at cost, which then sold a 95% stake back to Hainan Airlines a year later for 1.7 billion RMB, recording a 1.1 billion RMB profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

## The "Super X Plan" and Acquisition Spree

Despite two near-collapses, [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] saw the global financial crisis as an opportunity for cheap overseas acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. They launched the "Super X plan" with the goal of accumulating 1 trillion RMB ($148 billion USD) in assets within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. From late 2010 to 2017, [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] spent billions acquiring hotels, technology companies, real estate, and airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This frenzy peaked from 2015 to 2017, with $50 billion spent on 123 acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

Key acquisitions included:

*   **Travel Industry:**
    *   **Airlines:** Hong Kong Airlines and Hong Kong Express (2006) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, a 48% stake in Aigle Azur (France's second-oldest cargo airline, 2012) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, and minor stakes in South Africa's Comair and Brazil's Azul (2015) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
    *   **Cargo & Catering:** Swissport (cargo handler, $2.8 billion, 2015) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a> and Gate Group (Swiss airline catering, $1.5 billion, 2016) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
    *   **Hotels:** Began acquiring stakes in NH Hotel Group (Spanish company, Europe's third-largest) from 2011, eventually reaching 29.5% ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>; Carlson Hotels (Radisson brand, 2016) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, which caused conflicts of interest with NH Hotel Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>; and a 25% stake in Hilton Hotels from Blackstone ($6.5 billion, 2016) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

*   **Logistics and Shipping:**
    *   Plans for a global container shipping business led to the acquisition of Jinhai Shipyard and Tianjin Marine Shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
    *   Tianjin's $6 billion purchase of Ingram Micro (global IT equipment distributor, 2015) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. This acquisition was noted for its strangeness given Ingram Micro's low profit margin and the buyer being a marine shipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

*   **Financial Services/Leasing (HNA Finance):**
    *   Acquired Australian aircraft leasing company Alko out of liquidation (2009) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>, merging it into Bohai Capital Holding for heavy asset leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.
    *   Bohai spent $1 billion to buy GE Seaco (fifth-largest container leasing fleet, 2011) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.
    *   Purchased an 80% stake in Kronos Group Limited (2015) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a> and Irish leasing company Avolon ($7.6 billion, 2016), making [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] the fourth-biggest airplane leasor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
    *   Acquired CIT Group's aircraft leasing business ($10 billion, 2017), making [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] the third-largest in the industry with 910 aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

*   **Other Diversified Purchases:**
    *   Land under the former Kai Tak airport in Hong Kong ($1.1 billion, 2016) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
    *   Majority stake in Frankfurt Hahn Airport in Germany (March 2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.
    *   9.9% equity stake in Deutsche Bank ($4 billion, built up through a complex web of offshore companies, 2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>, making [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] its largest shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
    *   245 Park Avenue in New York City ($2.21 billion, May 2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
    *   16.8% stake in Dufry Group (largest duty-free shop chain, 2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

## Funding the Expansion

The vast majority of money for these acquisitions, often made at inflated prices, was borrowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

*   **Land and Land Development:** [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] shifted from mortgaging planes to mortgaging land development projects and other hard assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. They partnered with indebted provincial and city governments on infrastructure projects, leasing assets to help the governments duck debt limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] would then spin these projects into publicly traded subsidiaries, whose skyrocketing asset values and stock prices allowed [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] management to pledge shares for even more loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

*   **Complex Capital Structure:** Very early on, [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] evolved into a complex, intertwined web of China-based investment entities, including 10 on Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets and 7 on Hong Kong markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. As they acquired companies or stakes, they would inject these into their web and re-mortgage them for more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. The ownership and debt links were so complicated it was difficult to discern who owned what <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. This structure was likened to a Portuguese man-of-war: an agglomeration of smaller creatures that band together, entirely dependent on external currents for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

## The Beginning of the End (2017)

In mid-May 2017, [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] issued $500 million in bonds for its 245 Park Avenue purchase, one of its last overseas M&A financing transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

On June 22, 2017, the China Banking Regulatory Commission ordered several banks to conduct risk checks on the overseas borrowing and investing of [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] and other conglomerates like Anbang and Dalian Wanda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. This marked a turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.

*   **Financial Market Response:** In July 2017, [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] subsidiary Sherco canceled its purchase of Global Eagle Entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Bank of America stopped accepting [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] shares as pledges for new loans, with Goldman Sachs following suit in September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also requested information on [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]]'s financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   **Rising Debt Costs:** In November 2017, [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] issued $300 million in 363-day dollar bonds at an extremely high interest rate of 8.875% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. Yields on [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] debt began to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>.
*   **Government Criticism and Debt Disclosure:** The Chinese central government criticized [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]]'s Sanya new airport reclamation project for "suspected illegal use of the sea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>, shaking confidence in the company's vaunted government connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. A few days later, in late November 2017, [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] reported its core financial data, revealing an estimated current loan balance of 637 billion RMB ($94 billion USD), a 36% increase from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. Including unlisted subsidiaries, estimates reached 1 trillion RMB ($148 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. This made [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] Asia's most indebted company, leading to rapid downgrades by credit rating agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.

## The Unwinding (2018 onwards)

January 2018 began with a series of reversals for [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. Management met with creditors, announcing plans to unwind its buildup, return to core airline businesses, and sell 100 billion RMB of assets in the first half of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. A third of [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]]'s publicly traded affiliates had their shares suspended, including Bohai Leasing (its leasing business), Tianjin Tianhai (shipping/logistics), Hainan Airlines Holdings, and CCOOP Group (retail chain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>. For some of these companies, [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] had pledged up to 60% of total shares in circulation for loans, a key cash source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

Throughout 2018, [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]] began selling off assets purchased just a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. This rapid divestment occurred amidst personal tragedy: in July 2018, Wang Jian, co-founder and the "inside man" running day-to-day operations, died from a fall in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. Wang's 15% stake passed to the American non-profit that now controlled the majority of [[financial_strategies_and_debt_structure_of_hna|HNA Group]] shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. Tan Feng's son, Tan Xiaofong, was appointed the new Deputy CEO, and asset sales continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

Assets sold included:
*   Two plots from the Kai Tak airport site in Hong Kong (for $2 billion, a rare gain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.
*   Portions of the Deutsche Bank stake (from 2019 onwards) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
*   Swissport (swapped to senior creditors, August 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
*   Ingram Micro IT subsidiary (to Platinum Equity, December 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.

## Bankruptcy and Aftermath

Despite the asset sales, the devastating impact of COVID-19 on [[global_acquisitions_and_investments_by_hna|HNA Group]]'s core airline and travel businesses sparked a final crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>. On February 2021, [[bankruptcy_and_restructuring_of_hna_group|HNA Group]] officially entered bankruptcy proceedings, acknowledging $170 billion in debts from creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.

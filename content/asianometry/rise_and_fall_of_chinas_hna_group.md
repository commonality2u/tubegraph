From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

At its peak, China's HNA Group presided over an estimated $170 billion of assets across the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The conglomerate was a major shareholder in Deutsche Bank and Hilton Hotels, owned airports and other real estate in Germany, China, and the United States, and had the third-largest aircraft leasing business globally with over 900 planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Most remarkably, HNA acquired virtually all of these assets in just a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. By May 2017, the company was executing at least one multi-million or even billion-dollar transaction each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. However, as quickly as it rose, it came crashing down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Early History and Founding (1988-1993)

Chinese companies are known for their murky early histories and opaque ownership structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The southern Chinese island of Hainan, roughly the size of Taiwan but with a smaller population of about 9 million, was designated as a special economic zone in 1988 by the central government to attract investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

In the same year, the Chinese central government began deregulating its airline industry, restructuring its former national airline monopoly into six individual airlines and allowing private-public partnerships for provinces to establish regional carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The Hainan government contributed 10 million RMB (about $1.4 million) to start Hainan Provincial Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, but the company made no progress, never acquiring an airplane or a civil license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

Chen Feng, son of Communist Party officials and former People's Liberation Army Air Force member, worked at China's civil aviation regulator (CAAC) where he met future HNA Group co-founder Wang Jian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Chen later worked at the World Bank loan office in Haikou, Hainan's capital city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. While there, a former colleague recruited him to manage the struggling Hainan Provincial Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

Recognizing that 10 million RMB was insufficient to run an airline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, Chen and his colleague convinced the local government to reboot the business as a joint stock company, allowing private individuals to take shares in the state-owned enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. In 1993, Hainan Provincial Airlines restructured as a corporation and sold shares, raising 250 million RMB (about $35 million) from 122 stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The airline began operations that May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Growth through Debt and Creative Financing

In its early days, HNA established a dual chairman structure: co-founder Wang Jian managed internal affairs and strategic direction from the shadows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, while Chen Feng served as the external communications man, raising money from banks and potential investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Opaque Ownership and Early Financial Tactics

Despite raising $35 million, HNA still needed more capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Chen and his team secured an additional 600 million RMB ($84 million) from banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Early Chinese banks, unfamiliar with mortgages, would assign property rights of a purchased plane to HNA, allowing the company to "re-mortgage the purchased plane again to another bank for even more money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. HNA also borrowed against the future revenue streams from a plane's air routes, effectively mortgaging every plane twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This "one plane, two loan" approach allowed HNA to double its leverage and grow rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, though it was a "perilous way to scale a business" where new loans often paid off old ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

In 1995, Chen Feng successfully pitched George Soros's Quantum Fund, securing a $25 million investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This was the first Chinese-American joint venture in the China aviation space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Soros's reputation boosted the airline's image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. When Hainan Airlines later listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, the Quantum Fund's vehicle, American Aviation LDC, was reported as its largest shareholder with 21% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Soros doubled his investment to $50 million in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, but the Quantum Fund eventually sold its stake in 2011 due to HNA's "lack of corporate transparency and governance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

HNA's ownership structure remained "infamously complicated and opaque" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. While co-founders Chen Feng and Wang Jian held minuscule personal stakes at IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, they controlled a shell company that was the second-largest shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. From 2002 to 2015, the controlling shareholder was a Hainan Airlines Trade Union, then replaced by the Hainan Tahang Charity Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This foundation, founded by HNA, was likely a "stealth vehicle" for Chen to control the company, employing company friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Family members of the co-founders also profited, such as Chen's brother setting up a firm to buy engine parts, and Wang Jian's brother building high-end villas and a golf course, eventually becoming a billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Consolidation and Initial Challenges (Late 1990s - 2008)

In 1997, Hainan Provincial Airlines renamed itself Hainan Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, and a year later, established Hainan HNA Holdings, the predecessor of HNA Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. By the late 1990s, China's airline industry was "messy," with over 30 carriers losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. In 2000, China's Civil Air regulator reorganized state-owned aviation companies into an oligopoly of three airlines: Air China, Eastern, and China Southern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

Hainan Airlines, with 31 airplanes, was not large enough to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. They acquired three smaller airlines: China Xinhua Airlines, Chang'an Airlines, and Shanxi Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. China Xinhua Airlines, which operated out of Beijing's airports, was key in turning Hainan into a national flagship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Despite Xinhua's struggles with debt ratios as high as 98% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>, HNA Group acquired it in April 2001 for about 1 billion RMB, mostly in real assets like planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The new four-way entity focused on short and medium-range flights to China's regional cities, succeeding in turning a profit by 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### SARS Epidemic and Diversification

In 2003, HNA was hit hard by the first SARS epidemic, incurring a massive loss of 1.5 billion RMB and nearly going bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The Hainan provincial government, despite its relatively small financial stake, bailed out the company in 2005 with an injection of 1.5 billion RMB, 10% of its entire revenue that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

Hainan's reputation as a vacation destination grew after SARS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. HNA positioned itself to benefit by ensuring that over 40% of arrivals to Hainan came on a Hainan Airlines plane, landed at an HNA-owned airport, stayed at HNA-owned hotels, and were guided by an HNA-owned travel agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This diversification reflected HNA's "vertical integration strategy" and its "scope of its Ambitions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Co-founder Chen Feng stated their dream was to turn Hainan Airlines into an international enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Global Financial Crisis and Recovery Tactics

The 2008 Global Financial Crisis caused HNA Group to incur a 1.73 billion RMB loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. They attempted to IPO their airline subsidiary Grand Air China on the Hong Kong stock markets, but this was infeasible due to difficult market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The company survived due to two major events:

1.  **Government Injection:** The Hainan provincial government injected another 1.5 billion RMB into the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
2.  **Stimulus Package and Land Value:** In November 2008, the Chinese government announced a 4 trillion RMB stimulus package for new infrastructure projects, causing land prices to skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This included 9,000 acres of land in Haikou that HNA acquired when it bought Haikou Airport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. HNA held onto this "immensely valuable" downtown land, selling 4 billion RMB of bonds and 2.8 billion RMB of stock based on its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

HNA also recovered by "moving company assets between subsidiaries at favorable prices" to generate paper profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. For example, in 2007, two HNA subsidiaries transferred their HQ, the Kohang building, to HNA at cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. A year later, HNA sold a 95% stake in the building back to Hainan Airlines for 1.7 billion RMB, recording a profit of 1.1 billion RMB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

## The "Super X Plan" and Acquisition Frenzy (2010-2017)

Despite two near-bankruptcies, HNA, "no normal company," used the financial crisis's cheap overseas targets to launch its "Super X plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. The goal was to accumulate 1 trillion RMB of assets in just five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. From late 2010 to 2017, HNA spent billions acquiring hotel brands, technology companies, urban real estate, and airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This frenzy peaked from 2015 to 2017, with $50 billion spent on 123 acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

### Key Acquisition Categories:

*   **Travel Industry:**
    *   **Airlines:** In 2006, HNA acquired Hong Kong Airlines and Hong Kong Express, gaining its first international routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. In 2012, it bought a 48% stake in Aigle Azur Airline, gaining permission to fly into Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Minor stakes in South Africa's Comair and Brazil's Azul were acquired in 2015, which was "particularly strange" as HNA's airlines didn't fly to those regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
    *   **Related Services:** In 2015, HNA purchased Swissport (cargo handler) for $2.8 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>, and in 2016, Gate Group (Swiss airline catering) for $1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Hotels:** HNA had a "great interest in hotels" as it aligned with their business model and allowed for re-mortgaging properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
    *   Starting 2011, HNA began buying into NH Hotel Group, Europe's third-largest hotel group, eventually reaching a 29.5% stake and securing four board seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. They formed a joint venture to build hotels in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
    *   In 2016, HNA bought Carlson Hotels (Radisson brand) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. This led to a "conflict of interest" as Carlson and NH Hotel Group were direct competitors, causing NH to remove HNA's board members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.
    *   Also in 2016, HNA bought a 25% stake in Hilton Hotels from Blackstone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Logistics and Shipping:**
    *   In 2008, HNA announced plans for a global container shipping business with 200 ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>, buying Jinhai Shipyard and Tianjin Marine Shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.
    *   The most "eyebrow raising" acquisition was Tianjin's $6 billion purchase of Ingram Micro, a global IT equipment distributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. This was considered a "strange purchase" due to Ingram's low profit margin and the incongruity with a marine shipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. The deal underwent regulatory scrutiny by CFIUS but was approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.
*   **Financial Sector / Leasing (HNA Finance):**
    *   Inspired by GE Finance, HNA wanted to build a financial arm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. In 2009, HNA acquired ALC, an Australian aircraft leasing company that collapsed during the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. HNA bought it out of liquidation and merged it into publicly traded affiliate Bohai Capital Holding, the corporate vehicle for heavy asset leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
    *   In 2011, Bohai spent $1 billion to buy GE Seaco, the fifth-largest container leasing fleet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. In 2015, Bohai bought an 80% stake in Cronos Group to add scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.
    *   A year later, Bohai paid $7.6 billion for Irish leasing company Avolon, making HNA the fourth-biggest airplane lessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
    *   Finally, in 2017, they purchased CIT Group's aircraft leasing business for $10 billion, financed largely by Morgan Stanley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. The combined company had 910 aircraft and was the third-largest in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
*   **Other Notable Acquisitions:**
    *   A $1.1 billion purchase of land under the former Kaitak airport in Hong Kong in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
    *   A majority stake in the money-losing Frankfurt Hahn airport in Germany in March 2017, its first international airport acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.
    *   A 9.9% ($4 billion) equity stake in Deutsche Bank in early 2017, built up through a "fantastically complicated web of offshore companies" seven companies deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. HNA claimed to be Deutsche Bank's largest shareholder and placed a representative on the board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.
    *   The $2.21 billion purchase of 245 Park Avenue in New York City, closing in May 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. $1.75 billion of this was borrowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.
    *   In April 2017, HNA also bought a 16.8% stake in Dufry Group, the world's largest duty-free shop chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

## Funding the Frenzy

The vast majority of money for these acquisitions, often "made at an elevated price," was borrowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>.

### Debt Sources

1.  **Land and Land Development:** HNA shifted from mortgaging plane assets to mortgaging land development projects and other hard assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. HNA partnered with provincial and city governments on infrastructure projects, leasing assets to them to help them "duck their debt limits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. HNA then spun these projects into publicly traded subsidiaries whose net asset values and stock prices "skyrocketed," allowing HNA's management to pledge these shares for even more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.
2.  **Complex Capital Structure:** HNA evolved from a traditional corporation into a "complex intertwined web of China-based investment entities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. This included 10 public companies on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets and 7 on the Hong Kong markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. As HNA acquired companies, it could inject them into this web and "re-mortgage them out for even more money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. The ownership and debt links were "so complicated that it is hard to tell who owns what" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. The speaker likened HNA to a Portuguese Man o' War, an agglomeration of smaller creatures that "band together as a clump consuming anything in its way," but "entirely dependent on the season currents for survival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

## The Fall (Mid-2017 onwards)

The party ended in May 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. In mid-May 2017, HNA issued $500 million in bonds for its 245 Park Avenue purchase, one of its last overseas M&A financing transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

On June 22, 2017, the China Banking Regulatory Commission ordered several banks to conduct risk checks on the overseas borrowing and investing by HNA and other conglomerates like Anbang and Dalian Wanda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

In July 2017, HNA subsidiary Sherco canceled its purchase of Global Eagle Entertainment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. That month, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Bank of America stopped taking HNA Group company shares as pledges for new loans, with Goldman Sachs following in September 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also requested information from HNA about its financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.

In November 2017, HNA issued $300 million of 363-day dollar bonds at an "extremely high" 8.875% interest rate, "China's highest ever rate for its class," as yields on HNA debt began to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. That same month, the Chinese central government criticized HNA's Sanya new airport reclamation project for "suspected illegal use of the sea," which "shook confidence in the company's vaunted government connections" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>.

A few days later, HNA reported its core financial data, revealing an estimated current loan balance of 637 billion RMB ($94 billion USD), up 36% from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. Including unlisted subsidiaries, estimates reached as high as 1 trillion RMB ($148 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

> [!warning] Financial Challenges
> This made [[Financial Challenges and Debt Management at HNA Group | HNA Group Asia's most indebted company]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. Standard & Poor's and other credit rating agencies rushed to downgrade the company's debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.

January 2018 marked a series of reversals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. HNA management met with creditors, announcing plans to unwind its build-up and return to its core airline business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>, selling 100 billion RMB of assets in the first half of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. A third of HNA's publicly traded affiliates had their shares suspended, including HNA's tourism service, Bohai Leasing, Tianjin Tianhai (Ingram Micro owner), Hainan Airlines Holdings, and CCOOP Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>. For some of these companies, HNA had pledged up to 60% of the total shares in circulation for loans, a key source of cash for the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

Throughout 2018, HNA began rapidly selling off assets it had purchased only a year earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. In July 2018, Wang Jian, co-founder and the "inside man" running day-to-day operations, died from a fall in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. His 15% stake passed to the American non-profit that now controlled the majority of HNA shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. Chen Feng's son, Chen Xiaofeng, was appointed the new Deputy CEO, and asset sales continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:26">[00:28:26]</a>.

Assets slowly "melted away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>:
*   Two plots from the Kaitak airport site in Hong Kong were sold for $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.
*   The stake in Deutsche Bank was sold off starting in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
*   Swissport was swapped to its senior creditors in August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

## Bankruptcy and Aftermath

It seemed the company might make it through, but the "devastating effects that Covid had on HNA's core airline and travel businesses" sparked a final crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

> [!failure] Bankruptcy
> On February 2021, [[HNA Groups Bankruptcy and Asset Liquidation | HNA finally entered bankruptcy proceedings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>, acknowledging $170 billion of debts from creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. The company is expected to be split into four businesses after bankruptcy procedures are complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>.

The notion that HNA's rapid growth and borrowing were backed by, or a vehicle for, the Chinese government caused "a lot of anxiety" in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. However, an equally strong argument suggests that the company's "incredibly complex structure existed for a reason" – to dodge oversight, "at least until it no longer could" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>.

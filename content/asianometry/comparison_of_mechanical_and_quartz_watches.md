At the time of Japan's opening up, the global watch market was dominated by the United States and Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The [[Swiss watch industrys dominance and decline | Swiss sought to keep their secrets]] from other countries, but these secrets eventually spread, leading to Japan's rise as a major watchmaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## The Watchmaking World Before Quartz

At the turn of the century, the watch world was divided between the United States and Switzerland, each succeeding through different approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### American Mechanical Watches
In the United States, a small number of large companies like Waltham Watch and Elgin Watch produced hundreds of thousands of simple, cheap pocket watches for domestic consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. These watches utilized screw automation technology adapted from sewing machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. For example, Waltham was producing multiples more pieces annually compared to Longines in 1905 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Swiss Mechanical Watches
The [[Swiss watch industrys dominance and decline | Swiss watch industry]], conversely, comprised many small companies contributing to a wide range of high-precision timepieces, catering to diverse needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. In 1901, Swiss statistics showed 663 watch industry firms employing 24,858 people, with the largest company, Longines, employing only 853 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Switzerland dominated the pocket watch export market with approximately 93% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Japan's Entry and Early Challenges
Japan rapidly adopted Western technologies for modernization, including clocks and watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Initially, imported watches (1860s) were luxury goods for the social elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. By 1887, over 700,000 clocks entered Japan for public and institutional use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Japan's early clock industry focused on replicating simpler clocks to reduce reliance on US imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Hayashi Shigeji opened Japan's first modern clock factory in 1888, which successfully expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Japanese clock production volume grew from 37,460 pieces in 1905 to 1.2 million in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. By the 1930s, Japan became a clock exporting power, holding 35% of the total market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

The popularity of pocket watches also grew, with 10% of Japanese regularly wearing them by 1907 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Hattori Kintaro, who learned the watch industry at 13, founded Hattori & Co. (later Seiko) in 1881, initially repairing and reselling imported Swiss and American watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Hattori saw opportunity in the clock boom and opened his own factory, Seikosha, in 1895, making wall and grandfather clocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

However, Japanese mechanical watches struggled to compete with Swiss and American companies; they were less thin, accurate, or reliable, and more expensive due to lack of economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Japanese [[Japanese market strategies in the watch industry | Market Strategies]] and Swiss Response
Japan's regaining sovereignty over trade relations in 1899 led to an import substitution policy, significantly raising tariffs on finished watch imports (from 5% to 25%, then 40% by 1906) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This protection allowed Hattori's watchmaking business to thrive, capturing 85% of the domestic watch market by 1930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

Hattori & Co. improved manufacturing by automating select Swiss-inspired models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. They hired engineering labor to disassemble Swiss watches and sourced raw watch parts from Switzerland, which were not subject to tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This practice, known as "shablon" (importing disassembled movement sets for assembly within Japan), meant Switzerland provided 69% of Japan's watch parts between 1915 and 1935 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

> "From 1895 to 1899 Japan imported 22,500 watch movements from the United States and Switzerland. Then in 1900 the first year of the tariffs on finished watches Japan imported 122,000 movements and then in 1905 250,000. By then Japan was importing far more movements than finished watches." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>

The Swiss watch industry became concerned that shablon would transfer critical watchmaking expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This was exemplified by Rudolph Schmidt, a Swiss citizen who settled in Yokohama in 1894, initially importing complete watches but shifting to importing shablon after tariff increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. By 1910, Schmidt moved his entire watchmaking process to Japan, alarming the Swiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. In 1930, Schmidt acquired a workshop that would become Citizen Watch Company, which rose to be Japan's second significant watchmaker after Seiko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

By 1935, Hattori's factory became the single largest in the world, and both Hattori and Citizen began expanding abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. In response, the Swiss reorganized their industry into a cartel in the 1920s, forming Asag to purchase movement manufacturers, and the government eventually controlled all watchmaking activities, monitoring exports of watch parts and machine tools, and making shablon illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This ensured [[Swiss watch industrys dominance and decline | Swiss dominance]] for the next few decades, maintaining a 50% global market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

After World War II, when many companies halted production, the neutral Swiss maintained their market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. American watch companies struggled against cheap Swiss imports, leading to a long-term decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Hattori & Co. pushed to compete by copying Swiss machine tools, studying Swiss methods, and exploiting loopholes in the cartel system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. By 1966, Hattori produced mechanical watches that performed as well as their Swiss counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## The Rise of Quartz Technology

### Early Innovations
The principles behind quartz watches date back to the 1880s, when Pierre Curie discovered that applying pressure or alternating current to a quartz crystal makes it vibrate consistently at around 33,000 times per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This property could be leveraged for far more accurate timepieces than any mechanical clock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. In 1927, a Bell Labs engineer created a high-precision quartz clock the size of a room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

### The First Commercial Electronic Watches
In 1960, Bulova, a major American watchmaker, released the Accutron, the first commercial electronic watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. While not quartz-powered, it used a 360 Hz tuning fork, making it 10 times more accurate than a mechanical watch with far fewer discrete parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Max Hetzel, a Swiss scientist, developed this technology but couldn't interest Swiss companies, turning to the American market instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Bulova's commitment to tuning fork technology, even after quartz emerged as the future, led to a "first mover disadvantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. However, the Accutron spurred technological development in electronic watches across the US, Japan, and Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

### Seiko's Quartz Revolution
In 1959, Hattori (now Seiko) formed a team to commercialize quartz timekeepers, leveraging the transistor's commercialization for small circuits to power quartz crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Their initial goal was a portable quartz chronometer for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, which they successfully shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

Subsequently, they miniaturized the technology into a wristwatch. The resulting Seiko Astron SQ, released on Christmas Day 1969 in Tokyo, was revolutionary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. It cost what would be $31,000 today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Without access to advanced integrated circuits, Seiko created a hand-soldered hybrid circuit with 76 transistors, 29 condensers, and 84 resistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. They outsourced the CMOS production process to the American firm Interel, which transferred its knowledge to Seiko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. Seiko marketed the Astron with the line, "Someday all watches will be made this way," a prediction that proved correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

### Digital Displays and Market Shifts
Hamilton Watch, based in Pennsylvania, developed their own quartz watch, the Pulsar, utilizing light-emitting diodes (LEDs) to display time and date without hands or a dial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Marketed as a "wrist computer," the gold P1 version was a luxury fashion item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Its popularity surged when James Bond wore a P2 version in *Live and Let Die* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

By the mid-1970s, LED quartz watches became the market standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, with 650,000 units sold in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. LED watches eventually gave way to LCD watches due to better battery life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Integrated circuit firms like Texas Instruments and Intel entered the digital quartz watch category, viewing it as a "killer app" for their chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Casio, initially a calculator company, competed at the low end against Timex, offering affordable models in drugstores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

## Impact and Aftermath

### The "Quartz Crisis" for Switzerland
[[Japanese market strategies in the watch industry | Japanese watch exports]] into the United States, a critical Swiss market, exploded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. Export value grew nearly ten times, reaching $26 million USD in 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. By 1985, Japanese watch exports to the US totaled $373 million, with Seiko, Citizen, and Casio effectively pushing the Swiss out of their most valuable market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

Swiss exports stagnated, and their market share plummeted from 83% in the early 1970s to just 20% by 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. The [[Swiss watch industrys dominance and decline | Swiss watch industry]] failed to adapt to the [[Impact of quartz technology on the watch industry | quartz shift]], despite being aware of the technology and even demoing their own prototypes in 1967, two years before the Astron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. Their pride in mechanical heritage and fragmented industry structure hindered their ability to develop quartz watches on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

> "A mechanical watch and a consistently accurate one is hard to make you need a trained Artisans and painstaking effort a digital watch made with modern semiconductor production methods overwhelms all that human training with Titanic scale." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>

[[Impact of quartz technology on the watch industry | Quartz watches]] ended the Swiss grip on the global watch industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. Their 40% global market share in 1974 shrank to 10% ten years later, leading to over half of the country's watchmakers going bankrupt by 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

### Japanese Dominance and Later Challenges
The [[History of Japanese watchmaking | Japanese watch industry]], which peaked in the 1980s, faced challenges from industrial competitors in Hong Kong and China, leading to stagnation and relocation of manufacturing abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. They have since struggled to return to their former glory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

### The Swiss Comeback
Out of necessity, the Swiss also shifted to quartz technologies, and for a period, it seemed mechanical watch production techniques might be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. However, the Swiss mechanical watch industry has since made a comeback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Recognizing that their products have value beyond simply keeping time, they restructured into the Swatch Group, creating luxury watch brands and thriving in this niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

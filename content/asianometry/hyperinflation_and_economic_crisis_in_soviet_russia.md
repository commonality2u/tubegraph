In its nascent period, the Soviet Union embarked on a radical experiment to establish a society free of money, which proved to be a catastrophic failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Despite the country being ravaged by years of war and revolution, the Bolsheviks aimed to swiftly implement their ideal socialist utopia, characterized by a moneyless economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This period represents one of the most intriguing [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | economic and social experiments]] in world history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Theoretical Basis for a Moneyless Society

The concept of eliminating money was widespread and deeply ingrained among the Bolsheviks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Karl Marx, unlike classical economists who viewed money as a neutral facilitator of trade, believed money played a more significant, detrimental role in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

According to Marx:
*   Money contributed to cyclical booms of over and under-production in capitalist economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Capitalists only convert commodities back into more money (M-C-M') if a profit is guaranteed, leading to hoarding and subsequent overproduction crises when they all produce simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   Money served as the mechanism through which the bourgeoisie exploited the working class, by paying wages less valuable than the output of labor, generating wealth for capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Marx envisioned that money would be unnecessary in a centrally planned socialist society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Pre-Bolshevik Economic Conditions

Russia's [[economic_challenges_of_early_soviet_union | economic challenges]] began before the Bolshevik takeover. World War I forced many European governments, including Russia, off the gold standard and into printing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   The Imperial government abandoned the gold standard in June 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   It faced significant deficits: 39% in the first year of the war, and 75% in the subsequent two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   The war led to large budget overruns, foreign borrowing, physical destruction, economic output collapse, and high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   Between 1913 and 1917, industrial workers declined by 16.4%, and total industrial output fell by 22.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   By early 1917, paper rubles in circulation increased from 1.6 billion (July 1914) to 9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   In 1917, the Russian government's deficit reached 82% of its budget, with 73% funded by the printing press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Bolshevik Takeover and Initial Economic Policies

Upon seizing power, the Bolsheviks inherited an economy already mired in an inflationary crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Further exacerbating the situation, the new government lost access to much of the Empire's productive land due to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This treaty resulted in Russia losing a third of its population, nearly a third of its agricultural land, and over half of its industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Key resources like the Baku oil wells (97% of total oil output) and Ukraine (78% of coal, 74% of iron ore, 80% of grain) became inaccessible or contested during the Russian Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

Despite these dire circumstances, the Bolsheviks pressed forward with constructing a new socialist economy, as outlined by Lenin in "The Immediate Tasks of Soviet Rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. They aimed to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat and centralize all economic activities into a single national plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. These [[economic_policies_and_challenges_under_communist_rule | economic policies]] were characterized by rapid nationalization and attempts at demonetization.

### Nationalization of Banks and Industry

Believing that banking was central to the capitalist system, the Bolsheviks prioritized its nationalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   On November 20, 1917, the People's Commissar of Finance seized the Russian State Bank (Goss Bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   Private banks initially resisted funding worker-controlled factories, leading the Bolsheviks to occupy them in December 1917 and transfer their capital to Goss Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   By the end of 1918, all banks were liquidated and merged into Goss Bank, which ceased lending and merely accounted for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   This nationalization of banks choked credit flow, causing 405 enterprises and 205,000 workers to close in the first quarter of 1918 due to lack of credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

In June 1918, the Council of the People's Commissar announced the nationalization of industry, seen as crucial for the transition to socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. This process, intended to gain firm control of critical economic levers, occurred chaotically, with less than 14% handled by the central government; local organizations and trade unions carried out the majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This led to the expulsion of many skilled workers and business owners, whose replacements often lacked the knowledge to run the industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Funding the Revolution and War

Simultaneously, the Bolsheviks were fighting the Russian Civil War (summer 1918 to end of 1919) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The government channeled all efforts toward supplying the Red Army, utilizing every available laborer and resource for the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   The government had no means to fund these expenses through traditional capitalist finance methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   No one would lend to the Bolshevik government, especially after they repudiated all foreign debts and nationalized assets in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   Income taxes only provided 7.3% of total budget spending in 1918, forcing the Bolsheviks to raise indirect taxes and introduce an extraordinary income tax, despite earlier promises to abolish them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   The only remaining option to bridge budget gaps was to print more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Food Crisis and Requisitioning

Food supply was a critical issue from early 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   The Tsarist government had introduced a grain monopoly during World War I, prohibiting grain trading and requiring farmers to deliver surpluses to the state at fixed prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. The Provisional Government and then the Bolsheviks continued this policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
*   However, the crashing ruble meant wages no longer incentivized peasants to sell goods at official state prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   The government, perceiving the problem as one of distribution rather than production, responded by "requisitioning" food, which further discouraged peasants from producing surpluses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   In May 1918, the Bolsheviks announced a "food dictatorship," reaffirming the grain monopoly and allowing armed force to take food from peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Hyperinflation and War Communism

High inflation quickly spiraled into hyperinflation. The People's Bank announced in May 1919 that it would print as much money as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   Inflation jumped from 598% in 1918 to 1,376% in 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   The ruble's value collapsed so rapidly that the government published budgets retroactively, as planning ahead was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   By the second half of 1919, money printing costs consumed 45% to 60% of the mint's budget, yet ministries still received less than requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

Remarkably, the Bolsheviks argued that hyperinflation indicated their socialist transformation was succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Their stated goal was to devalue paper money to nothing, thereby annihilating the power of the wealthy, transitioning to state distribution, and ultimately achieving a moneyless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. However, this unlimited printing also revealed the Bolsheviks' continued reliance on the old, ruined capitalist system to maintain their industrial and war efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

After the Red Army essentially won the Civil War around April 1920, the policies of "War Communism" intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   The state sought to take over the entire supply and distribution system, making public services like transportation, telegraph, medicines, food, consumer goods, fuel, and postage free by December 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   Private trade and money were to be abolished, with the government controlling all inputs and outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   Taxes and wages were paid in kind (physical goods), accounting for 93% of all wages by 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   Various accounting units were suggested to replace money, such as physical properties, salt, cooperative funds, or the "tread" (a unit of labor), but these only confused people and proved impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   The hyper-inflating ruble remained the de facto currency: 16.3 trillion new rubles were issued in 1921 (still resulting in a 21.9 trillion ruble deficit), and 1.97 quadrillion in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. By 1923, 176.5 quintillion new rubles were issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Consequences of War Communism

By 1921, the Soviet government acknowledged that War Communism had gone too far, plunging the Russian economy into ruin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   The state was unprepared to centralize control over all goods, and the belief that economic market laws would cease to apply once the state took over distribution was incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   Illegal markets flourished, supplying most people's food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.
*   Production of key items like steel, sugar, and bricks virtually ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Overall industrial production fell to a third of pre-war levels (1913) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
*   The absence of money removed incentives for work, leading to railway desertion rates of 40% and workers producing only 45% of their pre-war output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   Hyperinflation devastated the lives of the Russian people. Daily caloric intake fell by 30% from the 1910s average (3,820 to 2,680 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
*   A severe famine broke out in 1921-1922, resulting in 5 million deaths, largely due to food requisitioning leaving peasants with no reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.
*   Peasant revolts, including the Kronstadt rebellion in 1921, shook Lenin's confidence in the current direction of [[rise_and_decline_of_soviet_economic_strategies | economic strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

## Shift to the New Economic Policy (NEP)

Lenin recognized that market activity had to be reintroduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. In March 1921, they implemented the New Economic Policy (NEP) to reverse the economic decline, grow output, and stabilize the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   By 1923, the Soviet government fully reversed course: they issued a gold-backed currency, made the Central Bank independent, and rebalanced the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
*   These measures, combined with the suppression of rebellions, led to economic recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

Lenin reflected on these mistakes, stating, "Life has shown how wrong we were" in believing economic tasks could be accomplished solely through enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. He considered the NEP a real way forward, attributing the failures of War Communism to Civil War interruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. However, the state's initial intention during the War Communism years was to tear the country away from capitalism, monopolize trade, and eradicate money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. These plans ultimately led to chaos, violence, and a complete collapse in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

Recent reports from TechInsights and SemiAnalysis indicate that SMIC, China's semiconductor national champion, has begun producing chips using their own [[7nanometer_chip_production_and_technological_significance | 7 nanometer process node]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This breakthrough has sparked significant discussion within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Understanding "7 Nanometer"

In the semiconductor industry, process node numbers are primarily marketing tools designed to convey improvements in power, performance, or area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The "7 nanometer" phrase does not correspond to any physical dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Instead, it signifies that the chips are approximately 70% better than the [[generational_shifts_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | previous generation]] 10-nanometer chips, which in turn were 70% better than 14-nanometer chips, and so on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. TSMC, for instance, refers to their 7-nanometer node as N7 to avoid controversy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## SMIC's N+2 Node

SMIC's new node, dubbed N+2, is a direct evolution of their N+1 process, which was first "taped out" in October 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Both N+1 and N+2 utilize deep ultraviolet (DUV) immersion lithography with multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This multi-patterning technique was a common approach for foundries before extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography became widely available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

While SMIC's N+2 node is capable of using [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | EUV technology]], the United States has imposed an export ban, preventing SMIC from purchasing such devices from ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

SemiAnalysis and TechInsights indicate that SMIC's N+2 is nearly identical (99% similar) to TSMC's N7 node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This similarity extends to the physical measurements of its transistors, including [[design_and_manufacturing_processes_of_mems | FinFETs]] and their placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. TSMC began high-volume shipments of N7 chips in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Therefore, SMIC's achievement of a high-volume N7 equivalent node places them roughly four to six years behind the industry's leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

The N+2 process is considered one of the most advanced processes offered by any foundry to its customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Economic Viability and Market Position

A key question is whether SMIC's N+2 is [[economic_viability_of_smics_chip_production | economically competitive]] without EUV technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. While it's technically possible to fabricate chips at nodes even more advanced than N7 using 193-nanometer immersion technology and multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, the challenge lies in achieving meaningful quantities with good yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Dr. Burn Lin, the "father of 193 nanometer immersion lithography," stated in January 2022 that SMIC could even fabricate N5-equivalent chips with multi-patterning alone, without EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

TSMC successfully ramped up N7 production with few reported issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Given the similarity of SMIC's N+2 to TSMC's N7, it is anticipated to follow a similar yield optimization curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

However, the market has evolved since 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Foundries with EUV technology possess significant [[economic_viability_of_smics_chip_production | economic advantages]] over those relying solely on DUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. An N7-equivalent node produced only with multi-patterning imposes manufacturing limitations that create serious design restrictions for chip designers, making it a product, but not an ideal one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. In an open market, SMIC's N+2 would likely not be [[economic_viability_of_smics_chip_production | economically viable]] due to the availability of better-performing alternatives like [[comparison_of_smics_n2_to_tsmcs_n7 | TSMC's N6]], which is an evolution of N7 and is equipped with EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

SMIC's N+2 is so similar to TSMC's N7 that it likely involves trade secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. TSMC successfully obtained product import bans on SMIC products in the U.S. in 2002 and 2006 due to the use of TSMC's trade secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. If TSMC were to pursue similar legal action again, it could eliminate N+2's viability as an export product, limiting its use to domestic Chinese products and exports to allied countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. While SMIC values export capabilities, especially to the U.S., they may no longer be as dependent on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Domestic Market and Huawei Collaboration

The Chinese chip design industry has significantly advanced since the initial TSMC-SMIC lawsuits in the mid-2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, and the Chinese electronics industry has matured considerably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. HiSilicon, [[huawei_and_smics_semiconductor_collaboration | Huawei]]'s chip design arm and once China's largest semiconductor company, would likely be eager to use N+2 for high-performance mobile processors for their popular phones and server chips for cloud services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. HiSilicon was a flagship customer of TSMC, fabricating chips like the Kirin 980, 985, and 990 series on N7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

The collaboration between HiSilicon and SMIC could be a formidable force, as foundries depend on massive production volumes to scale and optimize their process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Such volumes would allow N+2 to improve over time, similar to how TSMC shipped millions of N7 wafers for companies like Apple before EUV became widespread, becoming very proficient with the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Leadership and Strategic Priority

China has prioritized leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing since the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. A key factor in SMIC's recent progress is co-CEO Liang Mong-Song, a TSMC alumnus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Known for his technical brilliance and relentless pursuit of the leading edge, Liang joined SMIC in 2017 from Samsung, bringing his 200-person R&D team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. He reoriented the company from a "boring second source manufacturer" to a "leading-edge monster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. As long as Liang remains at SMIC, the company is expected to continue pushing towards the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## Export Controls and DUV Lithography

Access to the latest lithography technologies is critical for SMIC's advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The U.S. government has been pressuring the Netherlands ([[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]]) and [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | Japan]] (Nikon) to prevent the export of their immersion DUV lithography machines to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This push coincides with the N+2 shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

The U.S. has long blocked the export of the newest, most advanced EUV machines to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Expanding the block to immersion lithography represents a new step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Immersion machines use water and other fluids to enhance the resolution of older 193-nanometer ARF (Argon Fluoride) laser technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. These "wet" immersion lithography tools are workhorses of modern semiconductor manufacturing and are quite mature, with prototypes first appearing in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. ASML and Nikon are currently the only two suppliers in this market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

Converting "dry" 193-nanometer ARF machines into immersion lithography machines can be done relatively quickly (less than five years) but requires substantial technical effort and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:10:00]</a>. The Western semiconductor industry transitioned from dry to first-generation immersion lithography in about two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. An N7-equivalent node would require more sophisticated immersion technologies, extending this timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

As of this writing, [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | Japan]] and the Netherlands have not formally decided on a ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. The Chinese government has responded with accusations of unfairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. While it may not feel fair, governments worldwide protect their nationally important industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. The U.S. has protected its computing technology industries since the Cold War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

An export ban on 193-nanometer immersion lithography technology without a corresponding ban on dry ARF technology (which is less feasible) is estimated to add four to six years to SMIC's progress towards the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Such a ban would also likely stimulate significant investment in Chinese-made lithography, initially focusing on maintaining existing immersion equipment and facilitating the dry-to-immersion transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Whether Chinese companies can eventually ship a complete system on par with [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] or Nikon is debatable, with a gap estimated to be several years, though not insurmountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Significance of the Achievement

Achieving a legitimate [[7nanometer_chip_production_and_technological_significance | 7 nanometer node]] at high volume and good yield is a triumph for China's advanced manufacturing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Only three other companies have reached this level of scale and sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This accomplishment is a source of pride for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

## American Response

A successful immersion ban, if it occurs, would not be a permanently damaging blow to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. It can only maintain and slightly expand the Sino-American semiconductor gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. The U.S. administration likely values these few years highly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Historically, the American response to the [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | Japanese semiconductor challenge]] over 30 years ago showed that government involvement could only buy time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. The U.S. industry used that time to build new markets, improve manufacturing weaknesses, and adopt innovative new suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The current challenge suggests a similar approach is needed: "Don't be sorry, just be better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

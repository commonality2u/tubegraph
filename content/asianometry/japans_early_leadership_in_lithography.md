In 2019, [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology|ASML]] shipped the first high-volume EUV system, marking the lithography industry's shift away from Asia towards Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This was a significant loss for Japan, as Japanese companies previously led the lithography industry before [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology|ASML]] emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Despite discovering EUV, Japanese firms were unable to commercialize the technology in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Invention of EUV in Japan

Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography was invented in Japan in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Dr. Hiro Kinoshita, then working at NTT, successfully printed a circuit pattern using EUV light and a reflective optic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

At the time, EUV was one of several potential next-generation lithography candidates, alongside technologies like Electron Beam direct write, proximity x-ray, ion beam projection, Electron Beam projection, and 157 nanometer fluorine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The Japanese lithography industry explored all these options, but EUV was not their initial preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. They seemed to lean towards proximity x-ray, which was the focus of most early progress reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This assessment was shared by others, as the US Department of Energy's early EUV project ended without industry follow-up, and as late as 1997, Sematech ranked EUV in fourth place, with x-ray in first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## US Influence and Japanese Response

The American semiconductor leader Intel, after seeing demonstrations in Japan and at Department of Energy labs, became interested in EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Intel provided bridge funding to prevent the disbandment of the DOE EUV Project R&D team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. A year later, Intel and other US semiconductor manufacturers founded EUV LLC, a consortium aimed at raising an estimated $60 million per year for EUV lithography R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Intel's involvement and the establishment of EUV LLC caught the Japanese by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Due to US restrictions on foreign participation, Japanese lithography makers Nikon and Canon could not directly join EUV LLC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, though they were permitted to participate in design reviews and working groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Japan's EUV Development Program

Forced to pursue their own path, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched its own EUV lithography program in 1998, a year after EUV LLC's founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

The Japanese EUV development plan had three phases:
1.  **Phase 1 (1998-2001)**: Develop basic technologies for EUV lithography and its three core components: the exposure tool, the mask, and the resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This phase was led by ASET (Association of Super-Advanced Electronic Technologies), a government-funded research consortium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
2.  **Phase 2 (2001-2003)**: An unspecified organization would transform ASET's raw technology into a working prototype, with partial financial support from the Japanese semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
3.  **Phase 3 (leading into 2006)**: The Japanese semiconductor industry, presumably including SALTEC, Nikon, and Canon, would commercialize the prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. SALTEC (Semiconductor Leading Edge Technologies) is an industry-funded R&D consortium focused on applied technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Key Technological Challenges and Consortia

The development of EUV lithography required brand new engineering work despite sharing a philosophical heritage with predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Resources were limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

*   **Exposure Tool**: ASET focused its limited resources on optics manufacturing, including mirror reflective multi-layers and cleaning, as well as metrology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The crucial task of developing the light source was reassigned to a new industry organization, EUVA (Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography System Development Association), founded in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. EUVA included five Japanese equipment companies (Ushio, Canon, Nikon, Komatsu, Gigaphoton) and four semiconductor manufacturers (Toshiba, NEC, Fujitsu, Renesas), along with four universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. EUVA researched two approaches for EUV light: laser-produced plasma (LPP), which [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology|ASML]] eventually chose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, and discharge-produced plasma (DPP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

*   **Photoresist**: ASET also handled the EUV photoresist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. A major challenge was EUV light's high absorbability, limiting its penetration depth into traditional resist materials (700 angstroms vs. desired 4,000 angstroms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This necessitated the development of new thin layer imaging (TLI) technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

*   **Masks**: ASET needed new subsystems for producing mirror mask blanks (masks without patterns), adding patterns, and cleaning surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. A critical challenge was consistently producing defect-free photomasks, with tolerance for defects being just a few nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Traditional DUV light could not penetrate deep enough to detect defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, requiring EUV light (actinic light) for inspection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry established a separate organization, Mirai, for mask and lithography-related metrology and inspection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

By 2005, Japan's EUV efforts involved four research consortia: ASET (resist contamination control, multi-layer mirror masks), EUVA (exposure tool light source and some optics), Leading Project (inter-university collaboration on light sources), and Mirai (mask defect control and detection) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This was a complicated setup, contrasting with the American EUV LLC, which oversaw early commercialization as a single entity from 1997 to 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Although both programs shared information, the Americans were clearly in the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## The Push for Commercialization and Setbacks

Japan's 2005 plan aimed for high-volume EUV lithography to reach the 45 nanometer process node by 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. While Mirai produced an actinic blank inspection tool by 2005, the exposure tools and their components were the bottleneck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

This monumental task fell to Canon and Nikon, Japan's leading lithography makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. They aimed to first produce a small-field prototype (pre-alpha machine) for testing other EUV system parts, followed by a more ambitious full-field prototype (alpha machine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. The Americans, via Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories with Carl Zeiss, delivered their small-field "Micro Exposure Tool" (MET) in mid-2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

To meet their 2010 goal for the 45nm node, Japan needed a pre-alpha machine by end of 2005, a working alpha tool by 2006, and a beta tool by 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This optimistic schedule was necessary to catch up to [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology|ASML]], which was completing its Alpha Demo Tool for delivery in August 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

### Canon's Efforts

Canon, the junior partner in EUV, had not yet mastered 193 nanometer immersion lithography, the most advanced technology before EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. In 2006, Canon and EUVA completed their small-field prototype, the SFET, generating EUV light by firing a Krypton Fluorine laser at a jet of xenon gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Canon planned to produce its full-field prototype, the VS2, by 2009 for completion in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

However, Canon struggled with core EUV problems like increasing EUV power, producing defect-free masks, and extending optic system lifetimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. The global financial crisis, which shrunk Canon's profits by over 60%, also impacted their R&D budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Canon never built the VS2, and as of the transcript's writing, still only sells KrF non-immersion (dry) lithography systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

### Nikon's Efforts and the [[japanese_dominance_and_decline_in_lithography|Decline]]

Nikon was considered Japan's lithography leader, being the only immersion lithography producer besides [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology|ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. From 2001 to 2004, Nikon collaborated with ASET on three iterations of their small-field EUV tool, codenamed HINA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. In April 2006, Nikon completed its first full-field exposure tool, the six-mirror EUV-1 Alpha device, installed at SALTEC's R&D center and going live in January 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This progress was about 1.5 years behind [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology|ASML]]'s 2006 Alpha Demo Tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

While the EUV-1 was Asia's most advanced lithography machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, it was not commercially competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Its late installation pushed the EUV high-volume ship schedule back from the 45 nanometer node to the 32 nanometer node, with talks of 28nm and 22nm nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. This required higher light source power, which was a major drawback for the EUV-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

The EUV-1 used a discharge-produced plasma (DPP) contraption from Ushio and its subsidiary Extreme Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. While DPP was considered more power efficient, physically smaller, and cleaner than LPP, it struggled to output sufficient power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. The EUV-1's light source peaked at 100 Watts, far below the eventual goal of 250 Watts for high-volume production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Achieving this would require a system change, swapping xenon for tin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Although the tin-based DPP contraption was "nifty," it struggled with contamination and lacked sufficient power to be economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology|ASML]] also tried DPP but halted work in 2013, achieving sufficient power levels only with its laser double shot method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

Nikon's EUV-1 also faced contamination issues, with EUV light causing carbon contamination on mirrors, deteriorating reflectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. While oxygen and EUV dry cleaning helped with carbon, a mysterious siloxane contamination persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

After EUV-1 testing, Nikon planned the EUV-2, aiming for completion in 2011-2012 for the 32nm node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. However, [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology|ASML]] pulled ahead with an 18-month to two-year lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. The global financial crisis led Nikon to cut R&D budgets in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. Though a spokesman denied halting EUV development, the EUV-2 would remain an in-house unit, with the EUV-3 planned for 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>. In 2011, Nikon targeted the 16-11 nanometer nodes for around 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

The final blow came in July 2012 when Intel, Nikon's second-biggest customer after Samsung, announced a $4 billion investment in [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology|ASML]] for up to a 15% stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. Nikon's shares fell 7% after the announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. The market interpreted this as Intel moving forward with [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology|ASML]] alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. With annual R&D and capital expenditures for lithography around $355 million in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>, Nikon likely decided that without Intel as a cornerstone customer, continuing EUV development was not viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>. Nikon's EUV efforts quietly tapered off, and the EUV-3 never shipped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. [[development_and_history_of_asml_lithography_technology|ASML]] became the last company standing in the EUV lithography industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

## Legacy and Cost

Japan's EUV efforts were not entirely in vain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. Many component developments turned into viable advanced businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. For example, the actinic blank inspection tool from Mirai and Lasertec became a ready product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. Japanese companies like JSR, Shin-Etsu, and Tokyo Ohka Kogyo hold dominant positions in the EUV photoresist space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>, and Tokyo Electron makes equipment to apply these photoresists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

The total cost of Japan's EUV effort from 1999 to 2012 is estimated between $5 billion and $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. This includes Nikon and Canon's R&D expenses, the annual budgets of ASET and the four consortia, and investments from other semiconductor makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. In comparison, the original VLSI project that reshaped Japan's semiconductor industry and led to its lithography dominance in the late 1970s cost about $150 million in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>, indicating an exponential jump in R&D costs. Developing an independent EUV machine today would likely require at least $5 billion to $10 billion, direct guidance from European and American makers, and 10 to 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

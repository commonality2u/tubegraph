In the 1990s, [[siemens_semiconductor_investment_in_north_tyneside | Siemens Semiconductor]] undertook a significant strategic shift towards internationalization and market-orientation, moving away from its traditional domestic focus to compete globally in the booming semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. This strategy aimed to triple chip sales and enter the industry's top 10 rankings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

## Historical Context and Strategic Shift

Siemens, an established German company founded in 1847, traditionally enjoyed a secure and profitable position within Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. The German government supported Siemens through nationalism and employment, with state-run entities like the Bundesbank mandating orders for equipment produced in Germany, largely benefiting Siemens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. This allowed Siemens to charge exorbitant prices, sometimes with margins exceeding 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Over the years, these domestic profits enabled the company to diversify into various product lines and countries, including the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

However, the trend of deregulation in the US and UK by the 1980s forced Siemens to adapt and compete more aggressively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. This led to a strategic decision to become more international, shareholder-friendly, and market-oriented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

## The Booming 1990s Semiconductor Market

The global semiconductor industry experienced significant growth in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. The release of Microsoft Windows 95 and the rise of mobile phones drove mass adoption of powerful software, which, in turn, fueled demand for computers and semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
The industry saw growth rates of:
*   29% in 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>
*   32% in 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>
*   42% in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>
In 1995 alone, the industry invested an estimated $30 billion in new chip fabrication facilities (fabs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

## Siemens Semiconductors' Market Position and Niche

For most of its history, Siemens Semiconductors primarily served as an in-house producer, making chips for other Siemens divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. In the 1990s, it began competing for external customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. The division focused on niche markets aligned with the group's broader product lines, such as Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) for telecommunications, mobile phones, and automotive industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Sales grew 40% annually in the early 1990s, driven by strong demand in consumer electronics and telecom within its core European markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. By 1994, Siemens was the 12th largest semiconductor maker globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

Despite a 7% market share in Europe, its worldwide share was only 1.9%, indicating significant room for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

## Global Expansion Plan (1994)

To capitalize on growth opportunities and achieve its goal of tripling chip sales and entering the top 10, Siemens Semiconductor initiated an internal plan in 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. A major component of this strategy was internationalizing the company by establishing semiconductor operations outside Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

This included:
*   Assembly and packaging plants in Malaysia and Portugal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>
*   Strategic alliances with Japanese and American semiconductor manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>
*   Electronics assembly plants in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>
*   Plans for four new large-scale fabrication plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>

### The North Tyneside Fab Investment

In 1995, Siemens explored establishing a wafer fabrication facility in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. Having successfully completed a 16-megabyte DRAM facility in Dresden, Germany, Siemens planned to replicate this fab in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. The proposed facility would cost £1.1 billion (or $785 million USD) and directly create 2,000 jobs, representing the UK's largest-ever inward investment at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

Siemens considered multiple locations for the new fab, including Ireland, Austria, Israel, Singapore, and Vietnam, with Ireland and Austria being the primary competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.

Site selection criteria included:
*   Skilled, low-cost labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>
*   Excellent water and power infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>
*   Geological stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>
*   Ample government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>

North Tyneside in northeast England met these criteria, offering skilled technician-level workers willing to work shifts, and access to educated electronics and computing graduates from local universities or nearby Scotland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. Salaries were also 50% lower than in Austria or Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. The UK government offered a direct connection to the national grid, a first for a private company, and local development agencies provided extensive support, including government grants and job training subsidies totaling £64 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. While Ireland and Austria offered more lavish support (Austria offered £120 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>, the UK investment was considered strategically sound.

The decision to choose the UK was influenced by Siemens' commitment to the UK market, where its revenue grew 25% annually from 1985 to 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. Siemens was also the UK's 13th largest R&D investor overall and third largest in electronics, employing 10,000 workers across a dozen manufacturing sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. A new fab would be a significant addition.

The strategic benefits of the North Tyneside fab for the UK included:
*   Further establishing the area as a semiconductor destination, following Fujitsu's 1989 fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.
*   Potentially attracting more suppliers and semiconductor companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.
*   Technology and skills transfer to the local population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.
*   Reducing semiconductor imports from Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

## Market Volatility and Fab Closure

Despite the fanfare and rapid construction (completed in just 376 days, beginning production in May 1997) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>, the North Tyneside fab faced inherent risks. Siemens' strategy to equip the fab with older 16-megabyte DRAM technology, which was already becoming outdated by 1995, proved perilous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. While the intent was to produce these older memory modules profitably in a cheaper location to maximize ROI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>, the DRAM market is immensely volatile and prone to oversupply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. DRAM is a commodity product with little differentiation, competing primarily on price, especially against strong Asian competitors like South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.

In 1998, the semiconductor market crashed, particularly in memory. The price per megabyte plummeted from $27 in 1995 to $4 by 1997, and then to just $2 by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. Chips that once sold for $50 in 1995 were selling for just $1 in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. This collapse led to a stunning loss of 1.2 billion Deutsche Marks ($722 million USD) for Siemens Semiconductor in 1998, compared to a profit of 109 million Deutsche Marks ($65 million USD) in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>.

To cut costs, Siemens decided to close the UK plant in July 1998, after just 15 months of operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. The plant was too small, lacking the scale of its Dresden counterparts, and had no strong internal or external advocates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>. Pro-British management within Siemens Semiconductor had lost their jobs, and the new CEO was notably pro-Germany, prioritizing cost-cutting and refocusing on core markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>.

## Aftermath

The closure was costly, estimated at nearly a quarter of a billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51:00">[15:51:00]</a>, and required Siemens to repay government grant money, possibly over £15 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>. In August 1999, [[siemens_semiconductor_investment_in_north_tyneside | Siemens Semiconductor]] was spun off into a new company, Infineon Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. While there was a brief attempt to revive the facility under Atmel, it ultimately failed due to the dot-com crash, and the buildings were sold off in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:00">[16:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>.

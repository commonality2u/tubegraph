Desalination is the process of removing salts from salty sea and brackish water to produce fresh water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This process is energy-intensive and often powered by fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Due to the environmental damage caused by burning fossil fuels, there is a push to use [[nuclear_energy_as_a_sustainable_power_source_for_desalination | nuclear energy]] as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The [[economic_and_engineering_aspects_of_nuclear_desalination | economics and engineering]] behind nuclear desalination are significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Historical and Current Projects

Several countries have commissioned or are exploring nuclear desalination.

### Early Adopters

*   **Kazakhstan**
    *   In 1973, Kazakhstan was one of the first countries to build a nuclear desalination plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
    *   The BN350, a sodium-cooled reactor on the east coast of the Caspian Sea, provided electricity and nuclear heat to a desalination plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   The reactor complemented a traditional coal-fired power plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
    *   Its heat provided energy for the first stage of a Multi-Effect Distillation (MED) system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
    *   The system operated effectively throughout its lifetime with no reports of sodium leakages or abnormal operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   It achieved 85% availability and generated 40,000 cubic meters of water per day until its closure in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Japan**
    *   In 1978, Japan commissioned a nuclear desalination plant with the Ohi nuclear power station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   This Multi-Stage Flash (MSF) desalination system could generate 1,300 cubic meters of potable water daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
    *   Since then, Japan has added nine more nuclear desalination plants, many of which are still operational today without reported issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Other Countries with Operational Plants
*   **Pakistan** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
*   **India** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> (refer to [[development_and_expansion_of_indias_nuclear_program_including_international_relations | India's nuclear program]])
*   **China** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>

## Emerging Projects and Future Directions

Many countries are pursuing nuclear desalination projects, often leveraging existing nuclear infrastructure.

*   **Trialing Feasibility**
    *   **Argentina** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>
    *   **Egypt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>
*   **Russia**
    *   Russia has explored adding desalination capacities to their floating nuclear power plants, which are repurposed boats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.
*   **South Korea**
    *   South Korea has integrated desalination capacity with their SMART reactor, a smaller, safer experimental reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
    *   This reactor has produced about 40,000 cubic meters of water per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **China**
    *   Facing significant water scarcity, China sees nuclear desalination as a sensible solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
    *   As of 2020, China had about 115 desalination facilities, primarily for industrial uses, mostly powered by coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
    *   Their first commercial nuclear desalination project was at the Hongyanghu nuclear power plant, generating 10,000 cubic meters per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
    *   Other projects have been proposed in Ningda and Haiyang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Factors Driving Future Potential

The integration of nuclear power with [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination processes]] is attractive for several reasons:

*   **Co-generation Attractiveness**
    *   Many countries already have nuclear power plants located near salt water sources for cooling purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This makes co-generation of power and water economically appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
    *   Most existing nuclear desalination systems cogenerate power and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Operational Stability and Cost**
    *   While initial capital costs for nuclear energy are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, the operating cost of nuclear power is very stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
    *   Uranium fuel costs have little impact on water costs, meaning day-to-day costs remain consistent once the plant is running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This contrasts sharply with fossil fuel-powered plants, where oil price volatility can significantly increase water costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Environmental Benefits**
    *   [[environmental_concerns_of_desalination | Atmosphere-wise]], nuclear desalination appears environmentally benign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
    *   A significant secondary benefit is that fossil fuels are not burned to produce drinking water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
    *   Engineers implement multiple barriers and pressure differentials to prevent radioactive contamination of desalinated water, ensuring tritium levels remain below regulatory limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Experiences in Japan, the United States, and Kazakhstan demonstrate that nuclear desalination consistently produces water with very low tritium levels, often below naturally occurring levels in rainwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Societal Impact**
    *   [[nuclear_energy_as_a_sustainable_power_source_for_desalination | Nuclear desalination]] can enable "water-led growth" for societies and economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
    *   It allows for more water-intensive agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
    *   It can reduce tensions and conflicts over limited surface water resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

While solar and wind power desalination projects are progressing, [[nuclear_energy_as_a_sustainable_power_source_for_desalination | nuclear desalination]] offers reliably high amounts of potable water at a low operating cost, provided it is done safely and correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. The cost-benefit calculations of nuclear desalination are difficult to ignore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

The National Steel Corporation (NSC), once a source of pride for Philippine industry and one of the largest companies in the country, served as a rare example of a well-run government-owned company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. NSC employed over 4,000 workers in Iligan City and, having a head start on most other Asian countries in developing a steel industry, could have become a global giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:95">[00:13:95]</a>. However, a combination of factors led to its significant decline and eventual failure by 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

## Initial State and Rationale for Government Involvement

Following World War II, the Philippine economy was primarily agricultural and semi-colonial, with significant foreign domination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. Despite a lack of petroleum reserves, the country possessed abundant metallic minerals like iron, copper, gold, and nickel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. President Carlos Garcia initiated an industrialization push, viewing these minerals as foundational for an industrialized future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:04">[00:57:04]</a>. The absence of suitable domestic steel facilities forced the Philippines to export iron ore to Japan and then re-import finished steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>. The government sought to establish an integrated steel mill to enable domestic shipbuilding, road construction, and electric power generation, as well as open doors to specialty alloys and industrial chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>.

In 1950, the government established the National Shipyard and Steel Corporation (NASCO) in Iligan City, a government-owned corporation focused on turning scrap metal into various steel products, primarily for ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>. The logic was to build ships domestically and gain export experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:45">[04:02:45]</a>. By 1955, NASCO received 50 million pesos to set up pig iron plants, which would transform it into an integrated steel mill, making it Asia's second such facility after Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:35">[04:12:35]</a>.

## Early Challenges and External Pressures

### Currency Crises and Loan Conditionalities
A swift currency crisis impacted NASCO's plans, as the country needed to purchase steel-making equipment from abroad but lacked sufficient foreign currency, necessitating loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:36">[04:31:36]</a>. In 1958, President Garcia, while advocating a "Filipino First" policy, secured a $62.4 million loan from the United States Export-Import Bank (Exim Bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:03">[04:52:03]</a>. This loan came with two crucial conditions:
1.  The funds could only be spent on American steel-making equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:35">[05:02:35]</a>.
2.  NASCO's privatization was required, allowing the government to retain only a 51% share, with 49% to be sold to a private investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>. The Exim Bank reportedly insisted on this due to past bureaucratic inefficiencies in government initiatives, although it has also been suggested that American steel companies pushed for it to protect their interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:80">[05:17:80]</a>.

### Delays, Underfunding, and Political Interference
The privatization process faced several years of delays, causing significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:98">[05:44:98]</a>. The private investor, Jacinto Steel, acquired the entire company (Iligan Integrated Steel Mills or ISMI) by 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:26">[05:39:26]</a>. However, the initial $62 million loan proved insufficient to build a fully integrated steel mill, only covering a cold and hot rolling mill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:30">[05:51:30]</a>. The government had to guarantee the Exim Bank loan and provide an additional 30 million pesos to complete the integrated mill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:07">[06:05:07]</a>.

ISMI struggled to be profitable, with conflicting reasons cited:
*   One view suggests the Jacintos used ISMI as a financial tool to cross-subsidize other family ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:40">[06:21:40]</a>.
*   Another perspective highlights the government's failure to adequately protect the steel company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:90">[06:29:90]</a>. ISMI faced domestic competition and did not receive the same level of government support, such as raw goods subsidies, import bans, and tax incentives, that steel companies in other Asian countries like Japan received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:63">[06:33:63]</a>.

The global oil price shocks of the 1970s further exacerbated economic turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:05">[07:11:05]</a>. The peso devalued dramatically from 3.50 to 6.50 to a dollar in 1970, increasing the cost of imported goods and making it difficult for indebted industrialists to service foreign currency debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:30">[07:16:30]</a>. Their access to government assistance depended on their standing with President Ferdinand Marcos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:56">[07:35:56]</a>. As the Jacinto family was not favored, the Development Bank of the Philippines foreclosed on ISMI's loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:03">[07:44:03]</a>. After martial law was declared in 1972, the military seized these assets and transferred them to NSC, a Development Bank subsidiary, a process completed in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:97">[07:53:97]</a>.

## Challenges Under Direct Government Ownership (NSC, 1974-1995)

The government's intention in creating NSC was to stabilize the industry, preserve jobs, and protect creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:50">[08:06:50]</a>. In its initial years, NSC was in "survival mode," merely striving to keep operations running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:15">[08:14:15]</a>. It merged with several other bankrupt local steel factories, expanding its capacity significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:93">[08:29:93]</a>. By 1979, NSC emerged from survival mode as the Philippines' leading producer of billets, tin plates, and flat rolled steel, holding a monopoly over the domestic steel industry for the next two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:03">[08:44:03]</a>. NSC's flat steel products were highly regarded, even preferred over domestic competitors in China, Indonesia, and the United States, despite shipping costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:21">[09:01:21]</a>.

Despite its success, NSC faced new challenges in the 1980s when trade reforms lowered steel product tariffs to three percent, leading to an influx of cheap imports from Taiwan and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:08">[10:24:08]</a>. While NSC initially weathered this, remaining profitable in 1983, the market for its core flat steel products began to decline into the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:04">[10:33:04]</a>. Cheaper imports from South Korea and Taiwan eroded margins, compelling incumbents to upgrade and move into coil production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:04">[10:59:04]</a>.

NSC management recognized the need for substantial investment to stay ahead of market trends, particularly to build iron and steel-making capabilities to become a truly vertically integrated steelmaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:42">[11:11:42]</a>. However, the government, with too much exposure to numerous state-owned corporations, lacked the funds to spare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:08">[11:27:08]</a>. President Fidel Ramos openly considered that the government should not be operating a steel company, leading to the decision to seek a private investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:48">[11:35:48]</a>.

## Privatization and Its Aftermath

In 1993, the government auctioned off a majority share in NSC, stipulating that the winner must continue and complete NSC's business plans and maintain global competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:11">[11:46:11]</a>. The winner was Wintek Holdings, a Malaysian company, with the transaction finalized in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:65">[11:58:65]</a>.

A key issue was that Wintek Holdings were foreign steel *traders*, not steel *makers*, and their top management reportedly had no idea what they were doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:16">[12:11:16]</a>. Despite the Philippine government still holding a 12.5% share, this oversight was not addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:55">[12:21:55]</a>. The new management eroded trust, ordered massive quantities of raw steel at peak prices, and clamped down on financial disclosures, creating opportunities for fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. Losses skyrocketed, and NSC began laying off employees for the first time since 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:19">[13:03:19]</a>. In 1996, a year of economic prosperity for the Philippines, NSC recorded an unprecedented loss of 2 billion pesos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:96">[13:10:96]</a>.

Wintek sold NSC to another Malaysian trading firm, Hautic Investment Limited, in 1997, just before the Asian Financial Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. Hautic was heavily leveraged, having borrowed approximately $800 million USD for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:43">[13:29:43]</a>. The crisis led to another massive peso devaluation, making NSC's U.S. dollar-denominated loans and raw materials extremely expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:45">[14:02:45]</a>. Creditors and suppliers severed ties, and employees took early retirement buyouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:21">[14:11:21]</a>. Despite an attempted intervention by the city, NSC ceased operations in November 1999, resulting in 1,800 job losses and a 72 million pesos drop in city revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:28">[14:21:28]</a>.

Later attempts to revive the company under new private ownership also failed due to a chronic lack of funds and an adversarial relationship with the local community and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:37">[15:15:37]</a>. While cheap imports contributed to the decline of NSC's original markets, the company was still profitable until 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:56:06">[15:56:06]</a>. Ultimately, the confluence of incompetent management following privatization and an unprecedented financial crisis led to its downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:33">[16:07:33]</a>. The sprawling 145-hectare plant and its housing complex in Iligan City now stand as a reminder of what could have been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:02">[16:21:02]</a>.

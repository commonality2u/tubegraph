In the mid-1990s, the photolithography space, a critical area in [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | semiconductor manufacturing]], was dominated by two Japanese companies, Nikon and Canon, who together held a three-quarter share of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, a Dutch company, ASML, rose to overtake them, relegating them to minor players in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Today, ASML is Europe's most valuable technology company, while Nikon and Canon no longer compete at the cutting edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## What is Photolithography?

A photolithography stepper or scanner acts as a nanoscale printer, projecting integrated circuit patterns onto a wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A single wafer can produce hundreds of dies, which are the eventual parts found in chips like the Apple M1 or A13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  Coating a silicon wafer with a chemical called photoresist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  Using the stepper or scanner to project the integrated circuit design onto the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
3.  Etching away areas not exposed by the baked photoresist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
This process is repeated to achieve the desired level of sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While not the only machine used, the photolithography machine is one of the most critical in [[semiconductor manufacturing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Historical Dominance Shifts

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the United States dominated the photolithography tools market, with Perkin Elmer and Geophysics Corporation of America (GCA) as the top two companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Alarmed by this, the Japanese government, through the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, reorganized their computer industry and gathered optical manufacturers to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This effort, known as the VLSI research project, led to Nikon introducing its first commercial stepper in 1980, quickly followed by Canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Their products offered superior performance at a lower price, allowing the two Japanese companies to overthrow American dominance in less than a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. By the early 1990s, Japan's technical lead in lithography tools appeared insurmountable, with no other viable competitor on the horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## ASML's Rise Through Generational Events

ASML was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between Dutch firms ASM International and Philips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Despite losing money for its first six years, Philips's backing helped ASML persist and gain a market foothold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. By its IPO in 1995, ASML had acquired 25% market share, tying with Canon and trailing Nikon's 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Three significant industry "generational events" allowed ASML to snatch market leadership from Nikon and Canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### The Twinscan System
In 2001, ASML developed and released its first Twinscan system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This system processes wafers in two stages: a measurement stage and an exposure stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This dual-wielding approach significantly increases wafers processed per hour, though it adds substantial complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Nikon and Canon could not replicate this technology quickly enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. ASML rapidly iterated on its success, achieving 50% market share of the lithography tools market by 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Immersion Lithography
The second breakthrough was a generational shift to immersion lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Previous techniques had an air gap between the wafer and the stepper, which immersion lithography replaced with water, allowing ultraviolet light to be shot through water at the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This technique, though long used for optical microscopes, was largely ignored by the industry until Taiwanese scientist Bern Lin demonstrated its viability for reaching a 45 nanometer process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. ASML commercialized it first with the Twinscan AT1150i in 2003, followed by the volume immersion product, the Twinscan XT 1700i, in 2006, which cemented ASML's dominant position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography
The [[semiconductor industry]] recognized immersion lithography as a temporary solution, anticipating that current optical wavelengths would eventually be insufficient for the next generation of [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | semiconductors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. The industry debated between particle-based and x-ray-based solutions, ultimately choosing EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Major chipmakers collaborated with ASML to commercialize EUV, which came a decade late and significantly over budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Canon never had a chance in this transition, and Nikon largely halted progress after 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. EUV cemented the massive technical gap between ASML and its Japanese competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Reasons for Japan's Decline

While ASML's successful navigation of these generational shifts explains its win, the reasons for Japan's decline are complex and involve several theories:

### Software Disadvantage
ASML's machines have seen an explosion in complexity, with products in 2000 using six times the number of CPUs and eight times the number of sensors as their 1989 counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This hardware demands sophisticated software; ASML's 2003 Twinscan had 1.25 billion lines of source code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. ASML effectively managed this complexity, being among the first to use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to visualize and develop software modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Canon and Nikon, however, were not strong in software and adopted abstraction-heavy software practices much later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### Decline of Japanese Semiconductor Industry
Canon and Nikon's market share rise coincided with the peak of Japan's [[semiconductor industry]], particularly in the 1980s, when companies like NEC, Mitsubishi Electric, Hitachi, and Toshiba dominated the chip-making market, holding 90% of the 256k DRAM market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. These companies formed Canon and Nikon's core market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. However, in the 1990s, American lobbying against low-cost Japanese exports, combined with the appreciation of the yen, led to Japan pulling back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This significantly impacted Nikon and Canon's business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Focus on Optics vs. System Optimization
Canon and Nikon originated as optics systems companies, with their core work centered on lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. As [[semiconductor engineering]] approached physical limits, engineers had to seek other avenues for gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. ASML, perhaps because it outsourced optics R&D to Zeiss, was able to look beyond mere optics and optimize other aspects of their tools, such as utilizing new chemicals in photoresist and photomasks, and developing the two-stage wafer swap process for the Twinscan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### R&D and Industry Collaboration
ASML's success benefited from strong ties to IMEC, a semi-governmental nonprofit in Belgium, which is one of Europe's most advanced [[semiconductor research centers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. IMEC facilitates cross-industry collaboration, helping companies work together on new standards and ideas, which informs ASML on how its tools are used and interact with other vendors' equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. ASML's collaborative nature is evident in its joint publications with chipmakers, toolmakers, and chemical makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

In contrast, Canon and Nikon lacked a similar collaborating body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Their published papers were mostly independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. While they exchanged information with long-term partners, these exchanges were often limited to addressing serious problems rather than fostering ideas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Japan's earlier success in the 1980s was due to government-forced collaboration, but no similar initiative has taken its place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

### Weak Ties Between Industry and Academia
The breakthrough in practical commercial immersion lithography came from an American researcher at MIT who conducted experiments under industry-standard conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This requires close interaction between researchers and industry professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. In Japan, ties between industry and academia are weak, with industry professionals hesitant to disclose trade secrets and professors focusing on basic science without strong incentives for industrial application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. While Japanese universities began reforms in the mid-2000s, building technology licensing organizations similar to MIT, Stanford, and Berkeley, these efforts were late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## Conclusion

ASML's rise is inextricably linked to the simultaneous decline in competitiveness of the Japanese companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. While the exact reasons for Japan's fall are complex and multi-faceted, a key lesson is the importance of paying close attention to times of "generational shifts" in [[semiconductor manufacturing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. During these periods, like the transitions to immersion and EUV, the industry landscape shifts, transforming winners into losers and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

Despite the high-profile decline of Canon and Nikon, Japan's [[semiconductor industry]] still boasts many hidden champions with legacies and proficiencies from earlier years, who adapted to new times and survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

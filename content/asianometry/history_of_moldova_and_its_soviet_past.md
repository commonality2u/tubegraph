Moldova is a small country in Eastern Europe, and one of its poorest nations, suffering from immense corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Over two decades, politicians enriched businessmen, who then became politicians and took control of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. One individual, in particular, accumulated vast [[oligarchs_and_political_power_in_moldova | oligarchic wealth]] and controlled the entire country behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Geography and Early History

The Republic of Moldova is a landlocked country situated between Romania to its west and Ukraine to its north, east, and south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Its land area is approximately 33,800 square kilometers, comparable to Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The terrain consists mostly of forested hills and steppes with moderate winters and warm summers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Moldova possesses Europe's third most arable land per capita, with 40% of its population engaged in farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Wine is a well-known export, with a culture dating back to the early 1800s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. During its agricultural peak in the Soviet era, Moldova produced 30% of the world's tobacco and 20% of its total grape harvest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Moldova's complex history traces its modern republic to the Principality of Moldova, founded in the 14th century, which became a vassal state to the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. In 1812, the Ottomans ceded a large portion of the old principality, over 45,000 square kilometers between the Prut and Nistru rivers, to the Russian Empire via the Treaty of Bucharest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This area was known as Bessarabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The remaining parts of the old Moldovan principality, west of the Prut, later joined Wallachia to form the Kingdom of Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## The Soviet Era (Moldovan SSR)

After the Russian Revolution, the Moldovan lands between the Prut and Nistru rivers passed between various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. They initially declared independence and joined Romania as "Greater Romania," a move never recognized by the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. In 1939, after the Soviets signed a non-aggression pact with Germany, they demanded Bessarabia, which they acquired in June 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. This led to the founding of the Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union's]] second smallest republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Joseph Stalin aggressively persecuted those exposed to non-communist systems, leading to purges, deportations, and executions as part of an ideological cleansing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Romania, aligning with the Axis powers, reinvaded the area in 1941 during the German invasion of the Soviet Union, holding it until 1944 when the Soviets retook control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The Soviets regained a land devastated by war, followed by a massive famine, collectivization, and another wave of deportations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

The Moldovan SSR's leadership was dominated by ethnic Russians and Ukrainians, with ethnic Moldovans rarely reaching higher positions of power, unless they were from the Transnistria region (between the Nistru river and the Moldovan-Ukrainian border) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This region was fully integrated into Russian culture, with a population roughly 50% Russian and Ukrainian, alongside a sizable Moldovan minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Transnistria was the Moldovan SSR's most industrialized area, supplying 90% of the area's power despite occupying only 12% of its land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Path to Independence

In the late 1980s, tensions between the ethnic Moldovan majority and the Soviets led to strikes across the republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Two opposition organizations formed the Popular Front, a diverse group advocating for Romanian reunification, state sovereignty, or communist reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. In late 1989, a massive Popular Front rally with 500,000 participants demanded full sovereignty and the withdrawal of Soviet troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. By 1990, they won most seats in the Moldovan Supreme Soviet, breaking the Communist Party's monopoly on power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

In May 1991, the Moldovan SSR renamed itself the Republic of Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. A few months later, in August, it declared independence from the collapsing [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Challenges of Independence

The Popular Front leadership initially advocated for reunification with Romania, adopting a flag with Romanian elements and loosening border controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This move alarmed Moldova's ethnic minorities, comprising about 35% of the population, especially those in pro-Russian Transnistria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Consequently, in December 1991, Transnistria declared independence, leading to a brief war that ended in a ceasefire in July 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Moldovan leadership was blamed for this military blunder and the deteriorating economic situation, leading to their removal from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Like many other post-Soviet states, Moldova faced daunting challenges, undergoing a wholesale remaking of its identity, economy, and government simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The immediate concern was the ailing economy, which was collapsing rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The new Moldovan economy shrank by an average of 7% per year, experiencing hyperinflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. In the first six months of 1992, the monthly inflation rate was 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. By the end of 1992, 79% of Moldovans fell into poverty as the government could not adjust salaries and pensions to new prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The loss of Transnistria, Moldova's most industrialized area, further exacerbated the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

To stabilize the situation, the new government announced a transition to a functional market economy by 1996, aiming for liberalized trade and [[privatization_and_economic_challenges_in_postSoviet_Moldova | privatization of state property]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This involved distributing shares of state-owned firms and land from collective farms to the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## Post-Soviet Identity and Governance

Moldova's transition occurred amidst immense tensions between its various ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Years of Soviet oppression fostered strong anti-Russian sentiments among some, while many still supported closer ties with Russia, like the Transnistrians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Romanian nationalists continued to advocate for reunification, pointing to historical and linguistic similarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Conversely, many strongly favored Moldova's continued independence, possibly with aspirations of joining the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. These complex feelings created deep cleavages in governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

Unlike some other post-Soviet states like Belarus, Moldova's weak state, dire economy, and deeply divided populace initially prevented a single authority from monopolizing political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Throughout the 1990s, Moldova experienced competitive elections and peaceful transfers of power in the presidency and parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Incumbent presidents Mircea Snegur (1996) and Petru Lucinschi (2001) stepped aside for their successors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. The Moldovan media was openly critical of the government, and other branches managed to curb presidential powers, demonstrating a system of checks and balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

However, this intense political competition paradoxically led to the rise of informal relationships, clans, and patrons, planting the seed for unparalleled [[moldovas_political_and_economic_corruption | amounts of corruption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

## Economic Hardship and Failed Reforms

The situation of the Moldovan people did not improve throughout the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Economic relief efforts were delayed, and inflation did not abate until 1994 with the introduction of a new currency, the Moldovan Leu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Salary and pension indexing only began in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

The [[privatization_and_economic_challenges_in_postSoviet_Moldova | privatization]] legislation, passed in 1991, only started in 1993 due to political squabbling and lack of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Its execution was botched: while shares of state-owned companies were distributed to workers and the public, company managers used inside knowledge to buy shares at obscenely low prices or pilfer assets for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Agricultural land distribution was similarly flawed, starting late (mostly 1998-2000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Workers received plots without consideration for quality, and "smart people in the know" exploited the reform to assemble massive parcels of fertile land, creating private versions of the old collective farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

Overall, state [[privatization_and_economic_challenges_in_postSoviet_Moldova | schemes failed]] their goals, instead enriching a select group of connected individuals and creating a class of [[oligarchs_and_political_power_in_moldova | oligarchs]], while citizens remained cripplingly poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. By 1997, Moldova's GDP had fallen to 35% of its level 10 years earlier, and over 50% of the population lived in poverty (less than $2.15 a day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Many turned to the black market, which contributed 70% of the country's livelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. A 2000 poll found 91% dissatisfaction, and by 2005, 20% of the population had emigrated, making personal remittances a major source of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Moldova also continues to deal with a severe organ trafficking issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Return of the Communists and Rise of Oligarchs

In 2001, the Communist Party of Moldova, led by Vladimir Voronin, surged back into power, winning 49.9% of the vote and 71 of 101 parliamentary seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. They appealed to nostalgia for the Soviet era, promising free healthcare and closer ties with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. They became the only post-Soviet Communist party to recapture power after the Soviet collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Once in power, they consolidated rule using their strong organizational base inherited from Soviet times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

Voronin initially tried to tilt the country towards Russia, but domestic and international pushback thwarted these plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. By the 2005 presidential elections, Voronin proposed bringing Moldova into the EU, a genuinely popular platform despite the unlikelihood of immediate membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. The Communist Party won 46.1% of the parliamentary vote, and Voronin formed a coalition to remain president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

The 2000s were marked by theft and [[moldovas_political_and_economic_corruption | corruption]] as party politicians infiltrated the Moldovan economy, enriching themselves and their families by transferring public assets to private hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Vladimir's son, Oleg Voronin, headed a business empire receiving rich government contracts, arguably becoming Moldova's first billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Voronin also cultivated relations with businessman Vladimir Plahotniuc, who became one of his closest advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Plahotniuc, initially an economist and then a wine exporter to Russia, became vice chairman of VictoriaBank, one of Moldova's biggest banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. By the end of the 2000s, Moldova had 70 billionaires, whose total wealth accounted for 138% of reported GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Plahotniuc alone was worth $2 billion, making him the country's richest man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

## The Twitter Revolution and Oligarchic Conflict

In 2009, the Communists lost power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Parliamentary elections in April showed the Communists winning 49.48% of the vote and 60 seats, but tens of thousands of young people protested, arguing the results were rigged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Organized on Twitter, this event was dubbed the "Twitter Revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Parliament failed to resolve the situation and dissolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

Sensing an opportunity, Plahotniuc and a colleague defected from the Communist Party to the nominally European-oriented Democratic Party of Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Despite his obscure public profile, Plahotniuc's immense wealth and media company enabled him to quickly dominate the party and become one of the country's most powerful leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. This marked a shift where businessmen, having been enriched by politicians, now entered politics themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

For the next five years, Plahotniuc shared power with his coalition partner, Vlad Filat, another Moldovan billionaire who made his fortune from illegal trading and buying state assets while serving as State Secretary for privatization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Filat, who founded the Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova to resist the Communists' authoritarianism, became prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. The two needed each other for a parliamentary majority, carving up the country's government into their own fiefdoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Filat controlled financial regulators and the Ministry of Economy, while Plahotniuc solidified control of the judiciary and law enforcement, which became his crucial weapon against Filat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

Their alliance fractured when Filat targeted Plahotniuc following a December 2012 scandal involving an illegal hunting trip where a bystander was shot and killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Filat attempted to force out the prosecutor general, a member of Plahotniuc's clan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. In response, Plahotniuc launched his own anti-corruption drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

## The Billion Dollar Bank Fraud

In November 2014, an even bigger scandal, dubbed the "robbery of the century," emerged: three Moldovan banks were taken over and forced to issue nearly $3 billion in bad loans (about 15% of the country's GDP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. The money was laundered through shell companies to Latvian banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. When these loans defaulted, the banks collapsed, and the Moldovan National Central Bank secretly bailed them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. To cover the bailout, the Ministry of Finance was forced to issue $1 billion in 25-year bonds, burdening Moldovan citizens for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. The Moldovan currency devalued by over 40%, causing inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. This sophisticated scheme was masterminded by an Israeli-born Moldovan [[oligarchs_and_political_power_in_moldova | oligarch]] named Ilan Shor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

Protests against corruption erupted, with over 100,000 people demonstrating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Shor was arrested and implicated Filat in exchange for leniency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. Filat's immunity was stripped, he was arrested for corruption, his assets seized, and he was sentenced to prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

With Filat removed, Plahotniuc consolidated power, but was rejected by the president for the prime minister position due to integrity concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Despite being the quintessential backroom power broker, he was profoundly disliked, with a 95% disapproval rating and a 2% trust rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. Plahotniuc became the richest and most powerful man in Moldova, with a fortune worth over 30% of the country's GDP ($2.2 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. His clan controlled state-owned companies, financial flows, and four out of five of the country's TV stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. By the mid to late 2010s, Moldovans had lost trust in their government, with an 80% sentiment that the country was heading in the wrong direction (2016 poll) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

For three years, Plahotniuc captured the state, controlling media, judiciary, and attempting to solidify power through electoral reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. Although his party was nominally pro-European, Plahotniuc lacked a particular ideology, backing pro-Russian populist Igor Dodon for president in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

## Plahotniuc's Fall

Plahotniuc's power abruptly ended in February 2019 after parliamentary elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. The major winners were the pro-European ACUM alliance (anti-Plahotniuc), Dodon's pro-Russian Socialist Party, Plahotniuc's Democratic Party, and Ilan Shor's party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. No party won an outright majority, resulting in a hung parliament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. Unexpectedly, ACUM and the Socialists joined forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. This alliance, despite their opposing leanings, was reportedly influenced by Dodon's Russian patrons, who feared losing influence if he allied with Plahotniuc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

This unusual alliance, backed by the EU, US, and Russia, formed a government in June 2019 with ACUM's Maia Sandu as prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. Plahotniuc attempted to stop this, cutting power to the Parliament building and having the Constitutional Court invalidate the new government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. After sustained international pressure, the Constitutional Court reversed its decision a week later, acknowledging its bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. The Democratic Party conceded power, and Plahotniuc fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

## Conclusion

Moldova's journey since the Soviet Union has been challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Its Soviet past left it ethnically divided, and it struggled with a three-fold transition in governance, economy, and national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. These divisions contributed to the rise of an [[oligarchs_and_political_power_in_moldova | oligarch]] who captured the state for personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. While the nation united to oust him, Moldova remains a profoundly poor and corrupt society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>, requiring significant time and effort to reverse decades of poorly executed policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

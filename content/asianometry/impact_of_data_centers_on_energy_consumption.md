From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 
Data centers, critical infrastructure for the modern digital world, consume vast amounts of energy, with the [[ai_boom_and_data_center_demands | AI boom]] further intensifying these demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While their energy needs are widely recognized, their indirect [[water_usage_in_data_centers | water footprint]], largely tied to energy generation, is also substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

A datacenter with 15 megawatts (MW) of IT capacity is estimated to use between 80 and 130 million gallons of water annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This is comparable to the [[water_usage_in_data_centers | water usage]] of three hospitals or two 18-hole golf courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Types of Data Centers and Energy Efficiency
Data centers vary in size from small closet-sized setups to massive, custom-built facilities spanning entire football fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. They are typically classified by floor space, number of servers, or operational power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The largest are known as "hyperscale" data centers, which house around 5,000 servers and occupy 10,000 square meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These facilities, often built by companies like Google or Meta for global applications, can also be leased to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The large scale of hyperscale facilities contributes to [[energy_efficiency_in_ai_data_centers | energy efficiency]] through scaling economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Data center [[energy_efficiency_in_ai_data_centers | energy efficiency]] is measured by Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. A PUE of 1.0 is ideal, meaning 100% of the energy is used by IT equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Larger data centers tend to have lower PUEs; for example, Google and Microsoft claim PUEs of 1.1-1.2 for their hyperscale facilities, while a smaller data center might have a PUE of 2.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This difference is largely due to the more efficient [[cooling_systems_in_data_centers | cooling systems]] that hyperscale facilities can implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Cooling Systems and Energy Consumption
Almost all electricity consumed by a data center is converted into heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Even when not at full capacity, data centers draw 60-100% of their maximum power, generating significant heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Electronic equipment, like hard disk drives, must be kept cool (around 45°C or 113°F) to prevent damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

[[cooling_systems_in_data_centers | Cooling systems]] maintain stable temperatures and humidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Most data centers use air cooling, often with a raised-floor system where cold air from Computer Room Air Conditioners (CRACs) is channeled into cold aisles to cool servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The hot air is then re-collected and sent to fluid heat exchangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

A common two-loop system uses a process loop (e.g., water and glycol) to remove heat from the data room, transferring it to a water-based condenser loop for final dissipation outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Cooling towers are used to cool the water in the final loop, where evaporation releases energy and cools the water for reuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Approximately 1% of the water evaporates for every 10°F (5.6°C) of cooling, necessitating constant replenishment with make-up water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Overall Energy Usage
Beyond direct cooling, data centers have a significant indirect [[water_usage_in_data_centers | water footprint]] from the energy they consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. In 2022, data centers accounted for 1% to 1.3% of global electricity consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Power generation, particularly thermoelectric methods (coal, natural gas, nuclear), requires substantial [[water_usage_in_data_centers | water withdrawal]] for boiling water to spin turbines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. In 2021, 73% of the U.S.'s power came from thermoelectric means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. A study by Berkeley National Laboratory indicates that [[water_usage_in_data_centers | water usage]] for energy generation can be 2-3 times greater than that consumed directly by [[cooling_systems_in_data_centers | cooling systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

While evaporative cooling towers consume thousands of gallons of water directly, opting for air conditioning systems instead would indirectly use even more water due to their higher power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Although some companies like Apple are working towards using more [[Geopolitical Impacts on Solar Energy Trends | renewable energy]] for their data centers, most currently draw power from local grids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## Company Approaches to Water and Energy
Several major tech companies report on their [[water_usage_in_data_centers | water usage]]:
*   **Google**: Used approximately 4.3 billion gallons of water for cooling in 2022, with 25% being reclaimed wastewater or seawater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Digital Realty**: A real estate investment trust specializing in data centers, reported that about 36% of their water comes from municipal non-drinkable sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Roughly half of their 2022 [[water_usage_in_data_centers | water consumption]] occurred in water-stressed areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **AWS**: Their 2022 Sustainability Report states that 20 of their global data centers use recycled water for cooling, including 16 in Virginia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Microsoft**: Committed to becoming water positive, sponsoring projects that replenish more water than they consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

The majority of water directly withdrawn for cooling by these companies is potable water from local supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Given that 40-50% of the global population lives in areas facing [[water_usage_in_data_centers | water scarcity]], and data centers often locate near population centers, this adds a new competing demand for water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Arizona, a leading state for data center development despite drought conditions and reliance on the Colorado River, illustrates this tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Meta, for instance, plans to fund water restoration projects and leverage direct [[energy_efficiency_in_ai_data_centers | free cooling]] to reduce [[water_usage_in_data_centers | water usage]] by 60% in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Cooling Strategies for Energy Efficiency

### Free Cooling
"[[energy_efficiency_in_ai_data_centers | Free cooling]]" involves using natural conditions to cool data centers, reducing the need for traditional HVAC systems and their associated [[water_usage_in_data_centers | water usage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Direct [[energy_efficiency_in_ai_data_centers | Free Cooling]]**: Involves bringing outside air directly into the data center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. However, this often requires dehumidification, air filtration, and cleaning to protect electronics, which can partially offset cost benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Studies show average [[energy_efficiency_in_ai_data_centers | energy savings]] of 5.4-7.9% in Europe, and up to 60% in certain Australian cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Cold climates offer significant advantages, making Nordic countries attractive for data center investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Waterside [[energy_efficiency_in_ai_data_centers | Free Cooling]]**: Data centers near cold seas can use seawater for cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Google's Hamina data center in Finland uses existing paper mill pipes to draw fresh seawater, which cools the data center's internal fluid loop without direct mixing, before being returned to the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### Heat Recapture
[[energy_efficiency_in_ai_data_centers | Heat recapture]] involves recovering waste heat from data centers for reuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This heat can be used for desalinating water, pre-heating water in thermoelectric plants, direct power generation, or district heating for homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Air-cooled data centers can produce captured heat at 35-45°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. While space/water heating accounts for about 6% of America's total [[energy_efficiency_in_ai_data_centers | energy consumption]], efficient heat transfer requires demand sources to be relatively close to the data center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The lack of district heating infrastructure in many cities is a barrier, although Nordic countries have made progress in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Adopting liquid [[cooling_systems_in_data_centers | cooling systems]] would enhance [[energy_efficiency_in_ai_data_centers | heat recapture]] efficiency, as liquid is superior to air at capturing and transferring heat, also improving processor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

### Temperature Ranges
The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends a data center temperature range of 15-32°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Raising a data center's temperature by even 1-2 degrees can yield significant financial benefits, making it worthwhile to test these boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Google has conducted tests indicating their data centers can operate at higher temperatures, though some contradictory results suggest hard drives might perform worse in cooler conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

## The [[ai_boom_and_data_center_demands | AI Boom]] and Future Energy Demands
The ongoing [[ai_boom_and_data_center_demands | AI boom]] is rapidly increasing the energy demands of data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. Microsoft's 2022 [[water_usage_in_data_centers | water consumption]] jumped 34% from 2021, a significant increase attributed to ChatGPT and other generative [[ai_boom_and_data_center_demands | AI products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

Bob Blue, CEO of Dominion Energy, serving the Northern Virginia data center cluster, noted a dramatic rise in power requests: historically 30 MW per data center, now individual requests for 60-90 MW, and campus requests for 300 MW to several gigawatts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. SemiAnalysis predicts that [[ai_boom_and_data_center_demands | AI]] could push data center electricity consumption to 4.5% of global energy generation by 2030, with a corresponding increase in [[water_usage_in_data_centers | water consumption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Nvidia's increasingly power-hungry GPU products, like the B100, will further contribute to this trend, as training and deploying leading-edge [[ai_boom_and_data_center_demands | AI models]] demand maximum GPU utilization, leading to greater power and [[water_usage_in_data_centers | water consumption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## Conclusion
The future of compute and [[ai_boom_and_data_center_demands | AI]] will undoubtedly require significantly more electricity and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. This demand begins at the [[impact_of_semiconductor_facilities_on_taiwan_s_economy | semiconductor fabrication]] stage; for example, [[impact_of_semiconductor_facilities_on_taiwan_s_economy | TSMC]] in Taiwan is expected to consume 12.5% of the island's energy by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. After fabrication, these chips are installed in data centers where their full operation generates immense heat, requiring even more energy for cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

To address these escalating demands, future data centers will need to rapidly adopt a combination of [[energy_efficiency_in_ai_data_centers | free-cooling]], [[energy_efficiency_in_ai_data_centers | waste heat recovery]], and [[Geopolitical Impacts on Solar Energy Trends | renewable energy]] sources like [[Geopolitical Impacts on Solar Energy Trends | solar]]. This transition is crucial for both sustainability and economic viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

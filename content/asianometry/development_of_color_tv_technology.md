Sony co-founder Masaru Ibuka considered the color TV the product he was most proud of, a testament to Sony's engineering prowess and tenacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This breakthrough was the [[sony_trinitron_technology | Trinitron]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Sony's Foundations and Early Innovations

Sony's core was shaped by its two co-founders:
*   **Masaru Ibuka** - The company's lead engineer, known for his tenacity, drive for excellence, and motivating leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Akio Morita** - Sony's charismatic business leader and spokesman, pragmatic and focused on enabling Ibuka's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

They began by producing professional audio equipment, such as Japan's first commercially available tape recorder, the G-type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Early on, Sony licensed the transistor from Western Electric, which led to the creation of popular consumer devices like the TR-55 and TR-63 pocket radios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This marked an important [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | transition from vacuum tubes to transistors]] and was a significant step in the [[history_of_the_transistor_development | history of the transistor development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Transition to Television

Increased competition in transistor radios pushed Sony to explore new product categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Black-and-white televisions were the next logical step for transistorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Black-and-White TV Operation
Black-and-white TVs utilized an electron gun firing at a screen coated with phosphor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. When electrons hit the phosphor, it energizes and emits light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Deflecting the electron beam with energy allowed images to be put on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This process required robust components, as it generated significant heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Silicon Transistors
Early germanium power transistors were insufficient for TVs, necessitating stronger components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Silicon, with its higher melting point, was identified as the solution for handling higher temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. In 1956, Ibuka predicted "this will be the age of silicon" after attending a Bell Labs seminar highlighting its future importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Sony assigned a team to develop silicon power transistors from scratch, even though pure silicon was more expensive than gold and [[evolution_of_lithography_and_optics_systems | photolithography]] had not yet been invented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. They used oxide and mesa masking, involving selective application and etching of layers on raw silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This exemplifies the [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | advancements in semiconductor technology]] at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### The Micro-TV
Sony's first product with silicon transistors, the TV8-301, was released in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Despite being transistorized, it was small, fragile, and did not sell well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Sony faced limitations with their silicon power transistors, which suffered from excess power leakage that worsened with larger chip sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This restricted transistorized TV screens to 5 or 8 inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Despite American marketing consultants insisting a small screen would fail, Ibuka chose to lean into this perceived weakness, leading to the creation of the "Micro-TV" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. The 5-303W Micro-TV sold very well thanks to a focused marketing campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## The Quest for Color TV

Once black-and-white TVs were established, Ibuka turned his attention to color TV, a more complex challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Early Color TV Systems

#### CBS Field Sequential System
Developed in the 1940s, this system used mechanically rotating red, blue, and green filters in front of the camera at 1,400 revolutions per minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. A special color TV would then display these colored images sequentially so fast that the human brain perceived a single full-color image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

However, to avoid noticeable flicker, a high refresh rate was needed, which meant transmitting three times the number of images as black-and-white broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. CBS engineers reduced the frame rate and size, making the system incompatible with existing black-and-white TVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

#### RCA Shadow Mask Tube
RCA, with significant investments in the black-and-white ecosystem, developed the Shadow Mask Tube in 1949 as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: Three electron guns (one for red, green, blue) fired converging beams through a "Shadow Mask" (a thin metal sheet with tiny holes) towards a screen with red, blue, and green phosphor pixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Each beam was aligned to hit its corresponding color phosphor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   **Advantage**: It was compatible with existing black-and-white systems, which was crucial for its adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Weaknesses of the Shadow Mask Tube
Despite its compatibility, color TV adoption was slow, with only one color set sold for every fifty black-and-whites in the US six years after RCA's release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Brightness**: Only 15% of the electron beams hit the screen, making it not particularly bright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Cost and Manufacturing**: Three separate electron guns required intricate manual tuning by skilled workers, leading to higher manufacturing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability**: External magnetic fields could interfere with the beams' aim, causing annoying colored patches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Shadow Mask Production**: The mask itself was difficult to produce, requiring chemical, mechanical, and photographic techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Sony's Encounter with the Chromatron

Sony considered licensing RCA's system but Ibuka found the idea of simply copying the market leader "no fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. At a 1961 IEEE trade show, Ibuka and Morita discovered the Chromatron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### The Chromatron's History and Technology
Invented in 1951 by Dr. Ernest Lawrence (Nobel laureate and cyclotron inventor), the Chromatron impressed Morita with its sharpest and brightest color screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Sony acquired a technical license from Paramount Pictures, its owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

*   **Key Differences**: Unlike the Shadow Mask Tube, the Chromatron used a single electron gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. The screen phosphors were arranged in parallel, vertical stripes (green, blue, red) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   **Color Selection**: Instead of a shadow mask, it used a "grill" of up to 400 charged vertical wires positioned inside the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. These "color-selecting wires" would activate at precise times to deflect unwanted electrons, ensuring the correct color information hit the corresponding phosphor stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

### Challenges in Manufacturing the Chromatron
Sony established a new factory for the Chromatron, but mass production was plagued by issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **Synchronization**: Synchronizing the electron beam with the activation/deactivation of the metal lines in the grill was a major hurdle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Failure resulted in "sickening color variations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   **Complexity**: With 27 vacuum tubes and delicate wires, it was ten times more complicated than a standard shadow mask tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Low Yield**: For every 1,000 sets made, only two or three worked as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Misalignment of the grid caused color distortions, like faces turning green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

Despite these issues, Ibuka refused to halt production, believing that if one set worked, improvements could be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. In 1965, the team abandoned the single-gun method due to the high cost of the color-switching grill and switched to a three-gun method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. This reintroduced gun alignment issues but eased wire tolerances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

A 19-inch Chromatron was released in Japan in May 1965, selling 13,000 sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Each set, sold for 198,000 yen ($550), cost 400,000 yen ($1,111) to make, resulting in significant losses and a lifetime warranty due to defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

### Internal Conflict and the Ultimatum
By 1966, with color TVs going mainstream via the mature Shadow Mask Tube system, Sony's distributors urged them to produce a viable color TV for the US market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. The Chromatron continued to lose money and incur significant development costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

This led to palpable tension between Morita, who wanted to cut losses, and Ibuka, who remained committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Despite his frustrations, Morita secured a $2 million loan to fund the R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Finally, in 1966, Ibuka agreed to dissolve the team and adopt the Shadow Mask Tube if no alternative was found by year-end, personally leading the effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

## The Birth of the [[sony_trinitron_technology | Trinitron]]

During this critical period, the color TV team explored various approaches in parallel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

### Inspiration: General Electric's Portacolor
In 1966, General Electric released its "Portacolor" TV, a Shadow Mask Tube with a single electron gun equipped with three cathodes arranged in a straight line, creating three beams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Unlike the Chromatron's triangular (delta) gun formation, this was a linear arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

Susumu Yoshida, a Sony manager, found the Portacolor not bright enough but was intrigued by its three-cathode, one-gun setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. He suggested combining it with the Chromatron's grill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. His subordinate, Senri Miyaoka, rigged a black-and-white electron gun with two additional cathodes, surprisingly producing a bright, albeit blurry, picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. Miyaoka reported his findings, and Ibuka, upon reading the report, was convinced it could work in a commercial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

### Trinitron Technology
By February 1967, the Trinitron gun was completed, and a prototype followed in November 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.
*   **Electron Gun**: It featured a single electron gun with three RGB cathodes arranged in a horizontal line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
*   **Convergence**: The three electron beams converged at the center of a large electron lens, which is the origin of the name "Trinitron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.
*   **Deflection Plates**: These plates focused and directed the beams towards the correct phosphor stripe on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.
*   **Aperture Grill**: Instead of a shadow mask, the Trinitron used an aperture grill made of etched vertical metal wires, one for each color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This grill, while serving the same purpose as the shadow mask, allowed more electrons to pass through, resulting in a significantly brighter picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. The aperture grill presented its own engineering challenges, particularly thermal expansion from electron bombardment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

## Commercialization and [[impact_of_the_trinitron_on_the_market | Impact of the Trinitron on the market]]

Sony announced the [[sony_trinitron_technology | Trinitron]] on April 15, 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Despite internal protests, Ibuka ambitiously declared that Sony would offer ten thousand Trinitrons to the public by October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Yoshida, known as "Shogun Yoshida" for his ferocity, led the team to commercialize the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

To speed up commercialization, Sony initially released a 12-inch screen version of the Trinitron, although dealers wanted a 17-inch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. Six grueling months later, the first sets rolled off the Tokyo factory line, marking the culmination of an eight-year, $12 million development effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

The Trinitron disrupted RCA's long-standing virtual monopoly on color TVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. Its brighter screen and simpler production process allowed it to quickly dominate the small color TV market in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. By March 1969, sales reached 10,000 sets per month, rising to 20,000 a few months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. Demand outstripped supply, leading to new factories in San Diego and the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.

Between 1968 and 1998, Sony sold 180 million Trinitrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. The [[sony_trinitron_technology | Trinitron]] line was finally discontinued in the 2000s as LCD and other semiconductor displays took over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. The system remained largely unchanged for some twenty years after its introduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. The [[sony_trinitron_technology | Trinitron]] was one of the last Sony products directly overseen by Ibuka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

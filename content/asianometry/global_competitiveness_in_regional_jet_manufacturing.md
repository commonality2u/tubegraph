The global regional jet market is a specialized segment of the commercial aviation industry, focusing on aircraft typically seating up to 100 passengers and capable of flying farther than ordinary turboprop planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. These jets play a crucial role in air travel, especially in regions like the United States, where they ferry passengers to larger hub-and-spoke airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Market Landscape and Key Players

The first regional jets emerged in the early 1990s, aiming to replace aging turboprop aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. While the British Aerospace 146 was an early pioneer, the market quickly became dominated by Canada's Bombardier and Brazil's Embraer, who have long held the majority market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

More recently, this duopoly has faced new competition from:
*   Russia's Sukhoi Superjet 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>
*   China's COMAC ARJ21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>

These new entrants aimed to capitalize on what was anticipated to be a growing market before 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Japan's Ambition: The [[mitsubishi_regional_jet_mrj_development_history | Mitsubishi Regional Jet]] (SpaceJet)

Japan's interest in re-entering the commercial aircraft market, after nearly half a century, was driven by a desire to establish a flagship technology space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) initiated a five-year, $400 million program in 2003 to study an indigenous regional jet for 30 to 90 passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This project, initially targeting 30-50 seats, was upscaled to 70-90 seats based on market demand projections of over 4,500 units in the next 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) was selected to lead the project, launching the program officially in 2008 with a new subsidiary, the Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Despite MHI's extensive experience as Japan's largest military supplier and a crucial component supplier to Boeing (contributing 35% to a Boeing 787) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, developing their own commercial plane was a significant undertaking, as Mitsubishi hadn't done so since 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

The [[mitsubishi_regional_jet_mrj_development_history | MRJ]] aimed for 20% market share in the 70-90 seat category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. It was designed as a high-tech, stylish, and comfortable passenger jet, emphasizing fuel efficiency with a claimed 20-30% fuel reduction over competitors, dubbed the "world's greenest craft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The Japanese government provided hundreds of millions in subsidies for technologies like carbon composite molding and advanced aerodynamic design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### Development Challenges and Delays

The [[mitsubishi_regional_jet_mrj_development_history | MRJ]] project encountered numerous [[failures_and_challenges_in_japanese_commercial_aircraft_industry | failures and challenges]], leading to six delays and nearly nine billion dollars spent before its development was frozen in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These challenges highlight the complexities of global competitiveness in aircraft manufacturing:

1.  **Initial Design Changes and Supply Chain Issues**: The original design featuring significant carbon-based composite materials for the main wings was altered in 2009 to use aluminum due to unclear reasons, possibly [[impact_of_supply_chain_and_design_changes_on_aircraft_development | supply chain slack]] from carbon composite suppliers or concerns about composite durability under frequent takeoff/landing forces in regional jets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This led to the first six-month delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

2.  **Supply Chain Network Difficulties**: Building a supply network for a million precise and difficult-to-manufacture aircraft parts proved challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Unlike giants like Boeing and Airbus, who leverage economies of scale to secure parts when needed at lower prices, Mitsubishi often paid twice as much for parts and faced manufacturing halts due to unavailability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This contributed to the second program delay in April 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, and the third in August 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. This demonstrates the impact of [[collaboration_with_global_suppliers | global supply chains]] on new entrants.

3.  **Certification Complexity**: The certification process, requiring at least 2,500 hours of flight tests, primarily in the United States, was highly challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Misinterpretations and a lack of proper documentation among engineers, particularly regarding electrical wiring design, directly led to the fifth delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This necessitated a total internal redesign of the wiring, pushing delivery dates to mid-2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Four of the five delays by this point were attributed to poor documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

4.  **Competitive Landscape and Market Shifts**: The fourth delay, pushing the [[mitsubishi_regional_jet_mrj_development_history | MRJ]]'s release to roughly the same time as Embraer's E2 series, eliminated the [[mitsubishi_regional_jet_mrj_development_history | MRJ]]'s initial 20% fuel consumption advantage as both planes used the same Pratt & Whitney engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

5.  **Union Scope Clauses and Design Reworks**: A significant portion of the [[mitsubishi_regional_jet_mrj_development_history | MRJ]]'s order book (70%) came from American regional airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. These airlines operate under major airline agreements, subject to union scope clauses that restrict regional jet seat numbers and maximum takeoff weight to protect mainline pilot earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. This forced Mitsubishi to rework the [[mitsubishi_regional_jet_mrj_development_history | MRJ70]] into the SpaceJet M100, adding a few feet to its length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>, which naturally impacted the delivery schedule, leading to the sixth delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

6.  **Global Events**: The COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 caused further delays in type certification flights due to lockdowns, directly impacting global air travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

### Outcome for the SpaceJet

The accumulation of delays and costs, ballooning to nearly $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, made the program unprofitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. In October 2020, Mitsubishi announced a pause on all SpaceJet M90 development and a 95% reduction in Mitsubishi Aircraft employees, effectively putting the program on hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

## Comparison with COMAC ARJ21

A comparison with China's COMAC ARJ21, another indigenous regional jet, reveals similar development timelines for the maiden flight: both took about six years from project start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. However, the ARJ21's first commercial flight took eight years after its maiden flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. The SpaceJet might have had a chance to beat this if not for the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

## Broader Implications for Global Competitiveness

The [[mitsubishi_regional_jet_mrj_development_history | SpaceJet]]'s journey underscores the immense difficulty of building cutting-edge commercial aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Key factors affecting global competitiveness include:
*   **High Development Costs**: Initial estimates are often significantly exceeded.
*   **Complex Global Supply Chains**: Reliance on a small group of highly specialized suppliers for precision parts, who prioritize larger manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This impacts [[the_impact_of_globalization_and_manufacturing_shifts | manufacturing shifts]] and [[collaboration_with_global_suppliers | collaboration with global suppliers]].
*   **Rigorous Certification Processes**: Meeting stringent safety and regulatory standards, which require meticulous documentation and often lead to delays for less experienced entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.
*   **Market Consolidation**: The entrenched positions of Bombardier and Embraer, and the emergence of new players from Russia and China, make it difficult for new entrants to gain significant market share.
*   **Adaptation to Airline Demands**: The need to adapt designs to specific customer requirements, such as union scope clauses in the U.S., can lead to costly and time-consuming reworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

Japan's historical experience, where its post-WWII aircraft industrial development was halted, causing it to fall behind in the generational shift to jets, also played a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>. Its only prior post-war commercial plane, the NAMC YS-11, incurred significant losses, highlighting the [[failures_and_challenges_in_japanese_commercial_aircraft_industry | challenges in Japanese commercial aircraft industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. While this experience allowed Japan to become a key supplier for Boeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, ascending to a prime manufacturer proved a different level of challenge.

The suspension of the [[mitsubishi_regional_jet_mrj_development_history | SpaceJet]] program signifies a massive loss of experience, talent, and resources, making its revival highly challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. The market for regional jets remains competitive, demanding substantial investment, technological prowess, and robust supply chain management for success.

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The Daewoo Group, at its peak, was South Korea's fourth-largest business conglomerate, alongside Hyundai, Samsung, and LG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The company experienced rapid growth due to a favorable political environment and significant debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, within a two-year period, the entire group disintegrated under the weight of its liabilities, a severe recession, and widespread fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The [[collapse_of_daewoo_group | collapse of Daewoo]] tarnished the legacy of its founder and chairman, Kim Woo-jung, who fled the country until he received a pardon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Founder: Kim Woo-jung

Born in 1936, Kim Woo-jung was the fourth of six children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. His father served as the principal of Daegu Normal School, which was attended by future Korean President Park Chung-hee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, and later became the governor of Jeju Island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Kim's father was abducted during the Korean War and never returned, leaving the family to support themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. After the war, Kim Woo-jung moved from Daegu to Seoul, where he studied economics at Yonsei University, one of Korea's elite institutions, graduating in 1960 at age 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. He then worked for six years at a textile trade and export company owned by a relative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Founding and Early Success

In 1967, at the age of 30, Kim founded his own textiles trading company, Daewoo Industrial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. It began modestly with just $18,000 and four employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The name "Daewoo" (대우, 大宇) literally means "great universe," signifying Kim's significant ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Through sheer persistence, Kim convinced American department stores like Sears, JCPenney, and Montgomery Ward to sell his textiles by 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. A crucial turning point came from information that the US government planned to set import quotas on textiles, with foreign suppliers receiving a percentage based on current market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Daewoo strategically sacrificed both profits and product quality to gain as much market share as possible before the quota was imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This "ballsy gambit" paid off, and in 1972, Daewoo was awarded 30% of the quota, instantly propelling the company to significant success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

By its fourth year, Daewoo had exported over four million dollars worth of textile goods, becoming South Korea's second-largest exporter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This de facto monopoly provided the cash flow necessary to fund the company's future expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Expansion and Government Ties

Throughout the 1960s, President Park Chung-hee's administration focused on boosting exports and developing capacity in strategic industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Companies that followed this lead and succeeded received favorable loans and funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Daewoo was one such company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. In 1973, a year after securing its textile quota, Daewoo expanded into a wide array of new industries, including machinery, shipbuilding, construction, and automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

These expansions primarily occurred through acquisitions and joint ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Daewoo excelled at turnarounds, demonstrating relentless perseverance and a high appetite for risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. For example, in 1976, the company acquired struggling industrial machinery manufacturer Hankook Machinery, renamed it Daewoo Heavy Industries, and saw it turn a profit in its second year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. In 1978, Daewoo acquired Okpo Shipbuilding, which was merged into Daewoo Heavy Industries, and the shipyard became profitable five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

Daewoo's strategy mirrored that of its textiles business: a focus on market share over profits, high volume, and low prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The company rarely prioritized brand building, technological upgrades, or moving into more valuable market segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Consistent with government preferences, Daewoo heavily focused on exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Kim Woo-jung himself traveled 260 days a year, with Daewoo goods primarily sold in emerging countries across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

The company's rapid rise is inextricably linked to its relationship with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Daewoo benefited from Kim's personal ties to Park Chung-hee, whose primary school principal was Kim's father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Additionally, Daewoo regularly hired government elites and retired state bankers for executive positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. These close ties allowed Daewoo to secure highly favorable loans at a time when annual inflation reached 40% and private banks charged much higher interest rates; Daewoo's loans were in the 6-9% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. In return for these preferential loans, monopoly protections, favorable labor laws, and silent backing, the [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | chaebol]] like Daewoo contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to the presidency's slush funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Public Image and Ownership Structure

Kim Woo-jung became personally famous, profiled in international business magazines and elected chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. His 1989 autobiography, "Every Street is Paved with Gold," became a bestseller, selling over 2 million copies and translated into 21 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

Initially, Daewoo's ownership structure was typical for a conglomerate, with a private core holding company owned by the founder and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. However, in the 1970s, the Korean government mandated that the [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | chaebol]] take their holding companies public to provide liquidity to the stock markets and allow the public to share in economic benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. The [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | chaebol]], including Daewoo, resisted but eventually complied after the government curbed certain shareholder rights to protect family control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. To maintain control, families established complex cross-ownership structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. By 1997, Kim and his family owned, on average, just 6.1% of shares in Daewoo Group companies, but with subsidiaries owning approximately 30% of each other, Kim effectively controlled 38.3% of the votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This structure meant no shareholder could challenge him, even as his decision-making became increasingly erratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The intricate structure also made it difficult to assess profitability between Daewoo companies, which exclusively used each other's services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Peak Growth and Challenges

By 1979, Daewoo Group owned 41 companies and was South Korea's largest exporter, just 12 years after its founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The late 1970s marked two significant developments:
1.  **Entry into the Car Business**: In 1978, Daewoo partnered with GM Korea to acquire 50% of Sehan Motor, a company dating back to the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Daewoo would gain full control in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Daewoo Motors adopted the same low-price, low-quality strategy with minimal focus on R&D, which strained the company's finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
2.  **Assassination of Park Chung-hee**: President Park's death in 1979 led to major shifts in Korea's regulatory and economic climate, putting Daewoo on less stable ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Subsequent governments opened markets to foreign competition, and cheap loans began to dry up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

The 1980s presented new challenges for Daewoo's low-price strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. The South Korean won appreciated, making exports more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, and rising labor wages further increased costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Additionally, countries adopted protective trade barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, and China's opening meant new competitors adopting similar low-cost strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Daewoo recognized the need to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## The 1989 Bailout and Moral Hazard

In 1988, Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery faced near-bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Years of high debt and a focus on revenues over sales led to its decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. By then, Daewoo carried about $1.8 billion in debt (1988 USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Kim Woo-jung argued that Daewoo had only taken on the shipyard at Park Chung-hee's request and that the Korea Development Bank had not fully delivered on promised equity injections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Even shipyard employees, expecting a bailout, negotiated significant wage increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

In 1989, the government did bail out Daewoo Shipbuilding, providing 200 billion Korean won in preferential loans and injecting another 50 billion won directly into the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This reaffirmed Daewoo's close ties to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. While Kim briefly initiated efforts to improve product quality, ultimately, these initiatives lost steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This demonstrated a "moral hazard," where Kim, knowing the government would likely intervene, continued his risky strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

## The Car Obsession and Debt Accumulation

Kim plunged back into his most costly obsession: cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. In 1992, Daewoo Group acquired full control of its motor subsidiary, which was unprofitable, losing $200 million that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Nevertheless, Daewoo Motors embarked on a massive buying spree to become a global automotive leader, likely funded by previous bailout money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. This included acquiring a technical center in the UK (1994), starting a joint venture in Romania (1994), purchasing a Polish car company and truck factory for $1.8 billion (1996), opening an $800 million car plant in Uzbekistan (1996), and entering Ukraine and India through joint ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. In total, Daewoo bought 14 car factories in 13 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Many of these ventures failed, but the company refused to pull out, believing in their growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. For example, they were losing $30 million a year in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. In January 1998, at the peak of the Asian financial crisis, Daewoo took a majority stake in the struggling SsangYong Motor Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

All [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | chaebol]] used debt, with an average debt-to-equity ratio of 400% throughout the 1980s and 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. However, Daewoo not only carried the most debt—over $11 billion into the 1990s—but was also structurally the most vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Unlike other [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | chaebol]] with a cash-cow core company (like Samsung Electronics), Daewoo's core, Daewoo Corporation, was a trading and financial company prioritizing revenues over profits, funding its subsidiaries through borrowings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Similar to [[rise_and_fall_of_hanjin_shipping | Hanjin Shipping]]'s financial struggles after being separated from profitable Korean Air, Daewoo also operated on thin ice without a strong cash generator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

## The Final Years and Collapse

The market long suspected Daewoo's precarious position; in April 1997, just before the Asian financial crisis, Daewoo had the lowest price-to-book ratio among Korea's top [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | chaebol]] at 1.12, compared to Samsung's 6 and Hyundai's 3.66 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

The Asian Financial Crisis triggered a two-year sequence of events leading to Daewoo's insolvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. In late 1997, the Korean won plummeted against the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Korea received a large, controversial bailout from international entities, and its economy shrank by nearly seven percent the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. While other [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | chaebol]] pulled back, Daewoo recklessly pushed forward with its classic strategy, discounting products and acquiring new companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, including the acquisition of SsangYong in January 1998, which added more debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

Throughout 1998, despite its significant debts, Daewoo managed to raise an additional $14.1 billion, becoming the nation's single most indebted company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Investors likely believed the government would eventually intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Discussions for a bailout began in June 1998, but the government demanded austerity measures that Kim, an "empire builder," refused to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. In late 1998, the Korean government, realizing the contagion risk of a Daewoo debt default, instructed financial institutions to limit their Daewoo Group debt holdings to five percent of their portfolio, effectively cutting off Daewoo's credit lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

In December 1998, Daewoo finally agreed to downsize, consolidating 51 operating companies into 10 and reducing its debt ratio during 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. Despite warnings from Nomura Securities, the market, banks, and government were slow to react to the looming crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. The restructuring lacked enforcement, as creditor banks failed to withdraw funding when Daewoo missed its quarterly debt reduction targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Rumors of last-minute deals kept hopes alive, but by mid-1999, it became clear Daewoo was heading for default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

By the end of 1998, Daewoo was effectively bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. While management reported a half-trillion Korean won loss, they claimed core companies were profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. However, these profits were generated through fictitious overseas asset sales between sister subsidiaries at inflated prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. Without these fraudulent practices, Daewoo's actual loss was estimated to be eight times higher, or four trillion won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. Other estimates put the fraud as high as 23 trillion won ($19 billion), making it Korea's largest accounting fraud at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. Regardless of the exact scale, the company was insolvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

In July 1999, Kim Woo-jung attempted a final gambit, publicly offering his personal wealth as collateral and resigning all but his Daewoo Motors position, promising to bring it to profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. In return, he requested creditors inject another four trillion won (approximately $3.4 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. On August 1999, Kim was removed, and Daewoo's subsidiaries were placed into bankruptcy, to be sold off in parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. At its end, Daewoo owed over $50 billion in debt to 140 banks in over 100 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

Kim fled the country in November 1999, living in exile for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. Upon his return, he was tried, fined, and received a ten-year prison sentence, which was pardoned less than a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. He died in 2019 at 82 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

The [[collapse_of_daewoo_group | collapse of Daewoo]] resulted in trillions of won lost by banks and insurance companies, requiring public money injections from the Korean government to prevent their collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. This led to extensive [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | reforms in investor transparency and banking oversight]] and in the Korean accounting industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. While the fraud was documented, an estimated $750 million to $4 billion remains missing, possibly used for personal expenses or bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. Today, former Daewoo companies operate independently, some still bearing the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

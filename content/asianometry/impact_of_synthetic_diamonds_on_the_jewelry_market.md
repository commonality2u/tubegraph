From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The pricing of natural diamonds has historically borne little to no relation to their extraction cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. While industrial diamonds might cost around $58 to $60 per carat to mine, jewelry-grade diamonds can retail for $550 per carat, with high-class diamonds reaching up to $20,000 per carat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This disparity is due to various supply cartels, which have historically managed supply to maintain steady prices, similar to OPEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## [[history_of_diamond_pricing_and_market_manipulation | History of Diamond Market Control]]

The overpricing of diamonds is not a modern phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. For centuries, market entities have controlled diamond supply to inflate prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Antiquity:** Even when Indian kings dominated diamond production, prices significantly exceeded extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. In the 1500s, a half-carat diamond cost the equivalent of 30,000 days of an average laborer's wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **18th Century Brazil:** The 1725 discovery of diamonds in Brazil led to a price drop of 30-50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The Portuguese Crown swiftly intervened, taking control of mines and limiting supply to restore prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers and Market Domination]]

The most renowned supply cartel was [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **South African Rush:** The discovery of the 21.8-carat Eureka diamond in 1866 by an eight-year-old in South Africa sparked a mining rush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Production soared from 100,000 carats in 1870 to 3 million carats in 1880 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Cecil Rhodes:** Amidst this boom, Cecil Rhodes established the [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] Mining Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Rhodes managed the company efficiently, reducing labor costs (partially through housing migrant workers in closed compounds and tightly controlling their activities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This financial strength enabled [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] to acquire competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. By 1888, Rhodes and [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers Consolidated]] controlled the South African diamond mining industry, imposing production limits to stabilize prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Central Selling Organization (CSO):** Under Ernst Oppenheimer, [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] established the CSO, which required other diamond producers to sell their raw output at a fixed profit-guaranteed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The CSO then resold these diamonds in "sites" to jewelry cutting factories known as "site holders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Site holders had no negotiation power and had to accept the entire box of diamonds at the set price, with no resale of rough diamonds permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Violators were expelled from the cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Marketing Strategy:** The CSO also managed industry marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In 1938, Harry Oppenheimer partnered with N.W. Ayer to link diamonds with romance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This campaign used influencer and content marketing, giving diamonds to movie stars, planting news articles about celebrity acquisitions, and famously coining the 1949 slogan "A diamond is forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This cemented diamonds as a luxury pinnacle and a wedding tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds | Development of Synthetic Diamonds]]

For centuries, the creation of synthetic diamonds was a goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Early Attempts:** After Smithson Tennant demonstrated in 1797 that diamonds were a form of carbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, scientists like James Hannay and Nobel laureate Ferdinand Frederick Henri Moissan attempted to create diamonds by subjecting carbon to high pressure and heat in the late 1800s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Their claims of success were never replicated, and the technology of their era was insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Scientific Roadmap:** A breakthrough came in 1915 when Gilbert Lewis and Merle Randall showed that diamond and graphite were in equilibrium at 10,000 atmospheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This work helped map the temperature and pressure conditions required for carbon to manifest as diamond: approximately 2000 degrees Celsius and over a million pounds per square inch of pressure, possibly less with a metal catalyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### HPHT Method (High-Pressure/High-Temperature)

*   **ASEA's Achievement:** In February 1953, the General Swedish Electrical Limited Company (ASEA) produced the first synthetic diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Their device used hydraulic force from six anvils to apply pressure and ignited thermite with an electric filament to heat an inner graphite core to 2000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Adding an iron solvent (a mixture of cementite and graphite) inside the core, they created small diamond crystals (around 0.1 mm) at 80,000 bar and 2000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. ASEA did not immediately publicize or patent their work, allowing GE to overshadow their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **GE's Contribution:** General Electric (GE) formed a synthetic diamond research group in 1951, driven by concerns over reliance on overseas diamond grit for industrial use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Collaborating with Nobel laureate P.W. Bridgman, they developed a "belt apparatus" capable of 3 million pounds per square inch at 3400 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. At these extreme conditions, carbon directly transforms into diamond, producing small crystals about one millimeter wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

#### Initial Impact on De Beers
News of GE's synthetic diamonds temporarily threatened consumer confidence in natural gemstones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. However, the small size (1 mm) of these early synthetics meant they posed no immediate threat to [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]], which dealt in larger stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. While researchers later grew larger synthetic diamonds (up to three carats) using a seed diamond and precise controls, these were often dark, low-quality, and structurally unappealing, making them more suitable for industrial grit than jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

Despite the rise of man-made diamonds, [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] maintained its cartel control throughout the 1950s and 60s, navigating revolutionary politics in Africa and new diamond discoveries in Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. They even formed a semi-secret agreement with the Soviet Union, allowing them to market and sell 80% of global output despite mining only 25-40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

It wasn't until 1970 that scientists could create large, gem-quality HPHT crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The key was slow growth: a one-carat diamond takes about a week to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Faster growth caused flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. These long production times made them economically infeasible, and the resulting yellow crystals were easily distinguished from natural diamonds by UV fluorescence or absorption spectroscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | CVD Method (Chemical Vapor Deposition)]]

Researchers began exploring low-pressure environments for diamond growth to avoid expensive HPHT equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **Early Experiments:** From 1952-1953, William Eversole of Union Carbide company heated carbon-containing gas in the presence of a seed diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Carbon atoms attached to the seed, adding to its mass without high pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. This method, [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)]], is heavily used in the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Atomic Hydrogen Breakthrough:** Eversole's work was largely overlooked in favor of HPHT until 1963, when Dr. John Angus of Case Western Reserve University replicated and continued it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The key to growing pure, gem-quality [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | CVD]] diamonds was atomic hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Initially, Angus's team used alternating growth and cleaning cycles (etching off graphite impurities with sulfuric acid) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. A PhD student suggested using an atomic hydrogen stream from a tungsten filament for cleaning, which allowed both growth and cleaning in the same chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Soviet and Japanese Advancements:** In 1971, Angus mentioned his atomic hydrogen method at a Soviet academic meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. A Soviet team pioneered using atomic hydrogen not just for cleaning but also during the growth phase, which suppressed graphite formation and turned existing graphite into gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Their findings drew the attention of a team at Japan's National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This [[japanese_market_strategies_in_the_watch_industry | Japanese team]] used hot filaments or microwaves to activate hydrogen and methane, accelerating growth to micrometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

By the 1990s, the [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | CVD industry]] overcame its limitations, producing single-crystal synthetic diamonds in various colors and sizes, which began appearing in the jewelry market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

## Market Adaptation and the Future of Diamonds

[[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] initially responded to the rise of synthetics in the 1990s by investing in advanced detection tools like UV fluorescence and X-rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This was effective for a time, but synthetic diamonds rapidly improved, reaching a point where they can only be identified by advanced lab tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

This technical improvement coincided with massive changes in the diamond industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
*   **New Competitors:** While Japan's emergence as a luxury jewelry market in the late 1980s initially boosted the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, the fall of the Soviet Union and new deposits in Australia introduced competitors like Lev Leviev (who purchased factories and partnered with Russia's Alrosa) and Australia's BHP (with its Argyle mine, which operated outside the cartel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **[[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] Restructuring:** By the turn of the century, [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] acknowledged it no longer controlled the entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. In 2000, they restructured into a traditional luxury company, promoting [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]]' affiliated dealers and partnering with Louis Vuitton for branded retail ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
*   **Embracing Synthetics:** In 2020, [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] announced it would begin producing and selling its own synthetic diamonds, leaning into technological advances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

This market transition is analogous to the pearl industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Natural pearls were once wild-harvested gems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, but in the 1910s, Japan pioneered cultured pearl farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Consumers preferred these synthetic pearls for their rounder, more consistent appearance, and environmental friendliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Today, virtually every pearl sold in jewelry is cultured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

Similarly, modern gem-quality [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | CVD synthetic diamonds]] are often more beautiful, ideal-looking, environmentally friendly, and produced with less exploitation, at a much lower cost than natural diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Synthetic diamonds are "breaking" the market by shifting the value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Previously, consumers paid for the scarcity of the stone itself; now, they may pay for the scarcity and brand prestige of a luxury name like [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]], similar to a Louis Vuitton product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

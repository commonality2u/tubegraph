Japan's dramatic shift towards industrialization began with the Meiji Restoration, an event spurred by external pressures and internal discontent.

## The End of Isolation and Early Modernization Efforts

In the 1850s, the arrival of Matthew Perry and the "black ships" forced Japan's opening up, ending centuries of isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>. This traumatic event highlighted a massive industrial gap between East and West and deeply humiliated the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.

The ruling Tokugawa military government attempted to close this gap by modernizing the military, but the immense cost drained the treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. In response, the shoguns debased the currency and raised taxes, angering the populace, including merchants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## The Meiji Restoration

A group of samurai, fearing Japan would suffer the same fate as China, removed the shoguns from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. This movement became known as the Meiji Restoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. Concluding that the old regime of hereditary castes did not align with modernization, the new leaders instituted enormous changes across Japan's political, social, and economic structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

Under shogun rule, the hereditary samurai class served as local lords over fiefdoms, receiving fixed stipends that burdened government budgets and enjoying other societal privileges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. Meiji leaders stripped away these privileges, converting their stipends into government bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. While some samurai attempted rebellion, most accepted the new society, with many educated samurai becoming competent professional business managers in this new era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

## Government-Led Industrialization

To avoid Western colonization, the Meiji government sought to rapidly increase production and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. They recognized the need to build entire supply chains to industrialize a backward nation; for example, building weapons required iron, which necessitated iron foundries and railways to transport it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

To lead this push, the government founded many State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) in sectors such as railways, breweries, cement, textiles, shipbuilding, and weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. The goal was a "big push" to build enough industrial capacity to replace imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. These SOEs were not initially expected to make a profit, with losses covered by nationalizing Japan's mines and declaring all underground minerals state property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

## Privatization and the Rise of the [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan | Zaibatsu]]

By the late 1870s, SOE losses threatened to bankrupt the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. In the early 1880s, the government attempted to transfer these state-managed assets to private hands, but many money-losing SOEs offered at book value did not sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. A failed privatization round in 1880 led the government to include some of its profitable SOEs, including mines, in the next round four years later, for sale to the highest bidder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

The mines, which had been exploited for centuries, held the most opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Their output had dwindled due to flooding and technical limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. Foreign experts, invited into the country, suggested using steam power pumps, explosives, and vertical shafts, which successfully revitalized mine output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

Out of 21 of the biggest privatization sales, 11 involved mining, including the crown jewel Mikay coal mine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. The Mikay sale in August 1888 alone yielded more than everything else sold before it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. This injection of foreign technology unlocked significant previously hidden value but resulted in a massive transfer of public assets into private hands, a move comparable to the creation of Russian oligarchs in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

The merchant families who acquired these assets and benefited from them would go on to create the [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan | zaibatsu]], a term literally meaning "financial clan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. While merchant trading houses existed before the Meiji Restoration, they were not recognizable to Western business and held low social status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. The turbulent changes of the Meiji era presented unique opportunities for families with the right connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

Top-tier [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan | zaibatsu]] like Mitsubishi and Sumitomo dated back to the shogun days, while "second-tier" [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan | zaibatsu]] such as Nissan, Furukawa, and Kawasaki emerged after the Russo-Japanese War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. These groups were generally characterized by an extended family controlling a holding company, which in turn controlled many subsidiary businesses run by professional managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. Their assets were communal family property, not to be used by any single member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.

Their path to wealth was similar: they acquired exclusive rights to or purchased vast natural resources, then used these "cash cows" to fund future expansions into the Japanese economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. For example, the Mitsui family, already wealthy by the 1840s, switched allegiance from the shogunate to the new Meiji government in 1867 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. Mitsui helped fund the new government's armies, assisted in currency reform, and secured lucrative concessions for government financial services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. Their financial resources enabled them to acquire several mines, including the Mikay coal mine, forming the foundation of their vast wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.

Mitsui then established businesses like Mitsui Bank, Mitsui Mining, and Mitsui Busan (a general trading company) as corporate vehicles for their wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. Mitsui's expansion created a mini-economy; for instance, profits from Mitsui Mining funded Mitsui Chemicals for textile dyes, and Mitsui Busan established a shipbuilding subsidiary to transport wares, which in turn needed iron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. Without government pushback, these corporations soon dominated the domestic economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

This [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan | zaibatsu]] system, initially tolerated by the government due to its alignment with industrial and militarization goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>, eventually led to immense wealth for a few families while the average Japanese person had little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. This inequality and the [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan | zaibatsu]]'s influence would later become targets for reform following [[impact_of_world_war_ii_on_japanese_economy | World War II]].

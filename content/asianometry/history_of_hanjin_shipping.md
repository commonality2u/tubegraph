Hanjin Shipping, once South Korea's largest container shipping line, abruptly filed for reorganization in 2016, a move that caused global chaos in the shipping industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The company had been the fourth biggest container line globally in 2016, operating 97 ships and calling on 90 different ports in over 35 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Its unexpected insolvency was a significant event, as the company had been a source of national pride, akin to its sibling carrier, Korean Air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Founding and Early Growth

Hanjin Shipping was established as a branch of the Hanjin Group, one of South Korea's *chaebols*â€”large business groups that dominate the national economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The Hanjin Group itself began in 1945 when founder Cho Choong-hun started with a few trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. His initial contracts came from the US Army, trucking military supplies around the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. From its inception, Cho's companies focused on transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

After the Korean War, Cho needed to scale his business, and he turned to the national government for capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. President Park Chung-hee, seeking loyal companies for his economic growth plan, offered generous loans from state banks to those who cooperated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The Hanjin Group profited handsomely from this cooperation and loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## The Rise of Container Shipping

In the 1960s, the Vietnam War necessitated immense logistics efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This period was beneficial for American shipping company Sealand Service, whose founder, Malcolm McLean, had invented the practice of packing goods into standardized containers, significantly easing shipping across different transportation modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It was in Vietnam in 1966 that Cho Choong-hun first encountered containerized marine shipping, recognizing its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

A decade later, in 1977, Cho founded Hanjin Shipping alongside Korean Air, which had been acquired in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Hanjin Shipping was intended to be the business group's "Crown Jewel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### [[Container Shipping Industry Dynamics | Container Shipping Industry Dynamics]]

Maritime shipping is the backbone of globalization, transporting approximately 80% of the world's trade by volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Container shipping is one of three categories in the seaborn transportation industry, alongside bulk and tanker trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. While bulk and tanker transport are larger by total capacity, container shipping carries more valuable goods, giving it disproportionate importance in terms of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This high-value cargo makes the container industry highly competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

In 1972, South Korea possessed only three container vessels, with most container trade handled by foreign liners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The Korean government decided to develop its indigenous container capacity, implementing policies that encouraged the first generation of containerized shipping lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. By 1976, the country had 36 ships and five international container service lines, but still 90% of its container trade relied on foreign carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

To further boost the industry, in 1976, the Korean government began explicitly subsidizing Korean container carriers and established the Korea Maritime and Port Administration to guide the industry's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Hanjin Shipping emerged at an opportune time to capitalize on this national policy push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The company rapidly expanded its container service lines by acquiring new ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, offering its first Middle East service in 1978 and partnering with Sealand in 1979 for a trans-Pacific service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Turbulence and Expansion (Pre-Asian Financial Crisis)

In 1979, the shipping industry was hit by the oil crisis and a macroeconomic slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The Korean government consolidated its 70 shipping lines down to 20 and offered aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Although Hanjin Shipping did not receive a direct public bailout, its sister company, Korean Air, temporarily provided support in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Hanjin Shipping quickly recovered and returned to profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw a massive Korean export boom, with international trade volume tripling between 1987 and 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This benefited the Korean shipping industry, which positioned itself as a low-cost alternative to Western lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. During this period, the Korean government tightly regulated the industry, dictating routes and restricting new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Between 1986 and 1990, Hanjin more than doubled its carrying capacity from 24,856 TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units) to 53,140 TEU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. This growth was achieved organically and through mergers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. In 1988, Hanjin acquired the struggling Korea Shipping Corporation, becoming the 13th largest container shipping line globally and the largest in South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. By 1997, after acquiring DSR Senator, Germany's second-largest carrier, Hanjin became the world's fourth-largest shipping line, behind only Sealand, Maersk, and Evergreen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Impact of the Asian Financial Crisis

The Korean export boom ended with the Asian financial crisis in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Korea, being one of the worst-affected countries, required a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The IMF's conditions included policy changes aligned with neoliberal governance beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>:
*   **Market Liberalization**: The Korean government was compelled to liberalize its shipping business, opening the market to foreign players much faster than initially planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This exposed Korean shippers to full open market competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Debt Reduction Mandate**: All Korean business conglomerates were mandated to reduce their debt-to-equity ratios below 200% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Hanjin Shipping, like many other Korean lines, was forced to sell off owned ships to pay down debt, then charter new ships to maintain capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Hanjin had to sell and lease back 29 of its ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. While this improved debt ratios, it led to significantly higher operating costs due to short-term charter prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This combination of higher costs and new foreign competition contributed to a long-term decline in Korea's indigenous shipping lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## Succession and Splitting of the Empire

In 2002, Hanjin founder Cho Choong-hun died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. While he was lauded in the media as a great industrialist, his death also revealed that he had been under investigation for [[History of corruption and crony capitalism in South Korea | massive tax evasion fraud]] dating back to the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. His heirs, unlike him, were not as respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

Cho had five children, four sons among them, who divided the empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. The eldest son, Cho Yang-ho, became Hanjin Group chairman, while his brothers received various parts of the empire, including the shipbuilding, securities, and insurance divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Son Cho Su-ho received Hanjin Shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. They subsequently broke off from the main group, leaving Cho Yang-ho with Korean Air and the remaining company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This sibling rivalry meant Hanjin Shipping could no longer rely on its sister companies for financial support during hard times, unlike the undeclared bailout from Korean Air in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## The Global Financial Crisis and Collapse

A new recovery in 2007 and 2008 prompted Hanjin to invest in future growth, following leader Maersk in purchasing a new round of mega-ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. However, this proved to be "the exact wrong time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. By November 2008, just two months after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, Hanjin had committed to orders for nearly a quarter million TEU worth of ships, a 40% increase in their fleet size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

The [[Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on Shipping | Global Financial Crisis]] of 2008 led to a "Titanic economic slowdown" and a severe shipping overcapacity crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Trade between the United States and Asia declined by 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Major players like Maersk and CMA CGM suffered billions in losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. This oversupply cycle took years to resolve, leading to continued losses and soaring debt for Hanjin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Hanjin's debt rose from 195 billion Korean Won ($165 million USD) in 2012 to 440 billion Won ($375 million USD) by 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

To manage its debt, Hanjin began selling off its most profitable assets, including domestic and overseas terminals, liquefied natural gas tanker divisions, and bulk shipping divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Eventually, only the volatile container shipping line remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

By 2016, Korea Development Bank (KDB), Hanjin's largest creditor, demanded 700 billion Won ($615 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Hanjin could only come up with 500 billion Won ($440 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The final opportunity was a government bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

### [[Korean Governments Decision on Shipping Bailouts | Korean Government's Decision on Shipping Bailouts]]

Other countries had bailed out their shipping lines: Denmark lent $6 billion to Maersk in 2011, Germany lent $1.8 billion to Hapag-Lloyd, France lent $660 million to CMA CGM, and China provided $9.5 billion to Cosco and China Shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. However, KDB was also dealing with another struggling shipping line, Hyundai Merchant Marine, and demanded both companies restructure contracts, cut debt, and receive capital injections from their ownership families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Hyundai was able to comply, but Hanjin could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

The Korean government's decision not to bail out Hanjin, despite criticism and potential parallels to the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, stemmed from a reluctance to use taxpayer money for corporate "fat cats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. This marked a shift from previous years where the government supported the industry as a core national interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

## Consequences of Collapse

Hanjin's August 2016 insolvency "roiled the markets and lay utter chaos to the entire shipping market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
*   **Cargo Stranding**: 159 companies found their cargo unable to be delivered as Hanjin stopped paying terminal fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. $4 billion worth of goods, including critical Korean exports, were stranded at sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Hanjin shipped 40% of Samsung's electronics and 20% of LG's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Walmart alone had 3,000 containers at sea or in terminals, forcing them to purchase additional shipyards to store empty containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
*   **Job Losses**: The collapse annihilated tens of thousands of shipyard jobs in both Korea and the Philippines, where Hanjin owned the Subic Bay Shipyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Trade groups and unions protested, but the Korean government remained firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

Other countries' reactions varied:
*   **Singapore**: Faced with a similar decision regarding Neptune Orient Lines (NOL), Singapore opted to divest itself of the industry, selling NOL to French operator CMA CGM for $2.4 billion USD shortly before Hanjin's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Hanjin's collapse ironically helped NOL turn a profit soon after its sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
*   **Taiwan**: In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Taiwan government bailed out its two container shipping lines, Evergreen and Yang Ming. Taiwan's Deputy Minister of Transportation, Wang Kuai, stated that the nation relies on shipping firms to transport goods essential for economic development and that government support is necessary before damage becomes uncontrollable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

## Reasons for Collapse and Finality

Hanjin Shipping ultimately failed for two primary reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>:
1.  **Working Capital Crisis**: Despite owning many profitable assets, poor chartering practices left the company with unprofitable ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. After the founder's death and the splitting of his transportation empire, there was no wealthy sibling company to provide a bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
2.  **Government Non-Bailout**: Unlike other companies that made similar mistakes but received government backing, the Korean government decided not to bail out Hanjin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

After entering court receivership, Hanjin attempted to negotiate with its chartering and debt partners, but with over 1.3 trillion Korean Won ($1 billion USD) in charter fees owed over the next 12 months, the company declared bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. The last ship belonging to Hanjin Shipping was sold off for demolition in March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

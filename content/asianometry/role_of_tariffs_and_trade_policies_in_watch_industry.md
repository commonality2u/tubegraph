Trade policies, particularly tariffs, have played a significant role in shaping the global watch industry, influencing market dominance, domestic manufacturing, and technological transfer.

Trade policies, particularly tariffs, have played a significant role in shaping the global watch industry, influencing market dominance, domestic manufacturing, and technological transfer.

## Early Global Market and Japan's Entry
At the turn of the 20th century, the global watch market was primarily divided between the United States and [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Switzerland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The Swiss actively sought to prevent their watchmaking secrets from spreading to other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

When Japan opened up, Western-imported watches were initially viewed as luxury goods for the social elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. As part of its broader modernization goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, Japan sought to reduce its reliance on clock imports from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The Japanese clock industry rapidly gained competence in manufacturing, moving from 37,460 pieces in 1905 to 1.2 million in 1922 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, and by the 1930s, Japan had become a clock exporting power, holding 35% of the total market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Initially, Japanese watches struggled to compete with Swiss and American companies, being less thin, accurate, or reliable, and costing more than imported alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Domestic factories also faced challenges in achieving economies of scale due to low selling quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. These Western imports flowed freely into Japan due to an unequal treaty signed with the United States in the mid-1800s, which opened several treaty ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Japan's Import Substitution Policy (Post-1899)
In 1899, the unequal treaty lapsed, and Japan regained sovereignty over its trade relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The Japanese government promptly implemented an import substitution policy, significantly raising tariffs to deter imports and safeguard domestic manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   Before 1899, silver and nickel watch imports faced a low 5% tariff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   After 1899, these rates increased to 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   By 1906, they rose further to 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   Similar protectionist measures were applied to other industries like bicycles, machine tools, hydroelectric turbines, and automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

This protection from Western imports significantly boosted Japanese watchmaking. Hattori's watch business, for instance, saw its clocks capture 48% of the domestic market and its watches 85% from 1906 to 1930 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### The "Shablon" Practice
Despite high tariffs on finished watches, Japan leveraged a loophole by importing raw watch parts from [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Switzerland]], which were not subject to these tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. From 1915 to 1935, [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Switzerland]] supplied 69% of Japan's watch parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This practice of importing disassembled watch movement sets and assembling them domestically was known as "shablon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   From 1895 to 1899, Japan imported 22,500 watch movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   In 1900, the first year of tariffs on finished watches, imports surged to 122,000 movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   By 1905, this number reached 250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, with Japan importing significantly more movements than finished watches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Swiss Response to Japanese Competition and Shablon
The [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss watch industry]] grew concerned that shablon would lead to their long-term downfall by transferring critical watchmaking expertise to other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. An example of this was Rudolph Schmidt, a Swiss citizen who settled in Yokohama. His trading company initially imported complete watches but shifted to importing shablon after Japan raised tariffs in 1908 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. By 1910, Schmidt moved the entire watchmaking process, including case making, to Japan, alarming the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss watch industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

In response to declining watch exports in the 1920s, the Swiss reorganized their industry into a cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   Part suppliers signed "watchmaking conventions," restricting business only with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   A holding company, ASAG, was established to acquire various movement manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   In 1934, the Swiss government intervened, controlling all watchmaking activities and monitoring the export of watch parts and machine tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   Critically, shablon was made illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

These measures largely succeeded for several decades, allowing the [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Swiss watch industry]] to enjoy high profits and maintain a consistent 50% share of the global watch market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Post-WWII and the Quartz Revolution
After World War II, America's watch companies struggled against cheap Swiss watch imports. Despite new tariffs imposed by the United States government, the American watch industry entered a long-term decline and consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

The [[impact_of_technological_advancements_in_watches | transition from mechanical to quartz watches]] profoundly impacted trade dynamics. While the Swiss [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | watch industry]] "fumbled" this shift despite having prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>, Japanese companies embraced the new technology.

Japanese watch exports into the United States, a critical market for the Swiss, exploded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>:
*   Export value grew nearly tenfold, reaching $26 million USD in 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   By 1975, watches accounted for nearly 20% of total Japanese exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.
*   By 1985, Japanese watch exports to the US totaled $373 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

This surge in Japanese quartz watch exports caused Swiss exports to stagnate and their market share to plummet from 83% at the start of the 1970s to just 20% by 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. By 1983, over half of [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Switzerland]]'s watchmakers had gone bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

## Conclusion
The [[history_of_japanese_watch_industry_development | history of Japanese watch industry development]] illustrates that government protection and high tariffs can be instrumental in fostering domestic manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. However, it also demonstrates that export restrictions, such as those implemented by [[swiss_watch_industry_and_its_competitive_strategies | Switzerland]] to prevent knowledge transfer, do not always work as planned, as seen with the shablon practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. The rapid rise of Japanese watches, particularly through the embrace of [[transition_from_mechanical_to_quartz_watches | quartz technology]], fundamentally altered global trade flows and market dominance in the watch industry.

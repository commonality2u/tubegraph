From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The Gulf region holds a significant portion of the world's [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] water capacity, with over 65% concentrated there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Notable facilities include the Jebel Ali Power and Desalination Complex in the UAE, which has expanded to 2.2 million cubic meters of total desalted water capacity per day, equivalent to over 880 Olympic-sized swimming pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. In Saudi Arabia, the Ras Al Khair [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] complex, a power and water cogeneration plant built for over $7 billion, can produce 1 million cubic meters of freshwater daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## [[water_scarcity_challenges_in_the_gcc | Water Scarcity Challenges in the GCC]]

The countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman — are among the most [[water_scarcity_challenges_in_the_gcc | water-stressed]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Kuwait, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar possess less than 100 cubic meters of renewable freshwater per person, in stark contrast to an average household of four using about 136 cubic meters annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Surface water sources, such as Saudi Arabia's Al-Asfar lake, are often contaminated with heavy metals from agricultural runoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Groundwater exploitation is intense in the GCC, with only about 10% of extracted groundwater being recharged, leading to negative consequences like land subsidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Adding to the [[water_scarcity_challenges_in_the_gcc | challenge]], the GCC's population nearly doubled from 26.2 million in 1995 to 56.4 million in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The region is also highly urbanized, with 85% of its population residing in urban cities, a trend expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Water demand is rising, with agriculture consuming up to 85% of the GCC's water resources due to national security-linked food self-sufficiency requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Given these circumstances, [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] is seen as the primary solution for freshwater production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Desalination in the Gulf: A Historical Overview

Jeddah, a densely packed city in Saudi Arabia with less than 10 centimeters of rain annually, was an early adopter of [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. In 1907, the city purchased its first [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] machine from the UK, locally named the "Kendassa," which produced freshwater by evaporating and re-condensing seawater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

The 1920s and 1930s saw a global upsurge in [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] capacity, driven by the booming oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. World War II further advanced the industry, with the United States as the technology leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Post-war, Middle Eastern nations, including the GCC, were early explorers of this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. In 1957, Kuwait installed the first modern-style distillation plant by Westinghouse, capable of producing about 3,800 cubic meters of fresh water per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

In 1966, Saudi Arabia established a Water Desalination office, which later became the Saline Water Conversion Corporation (SWCC) and is now the Saudi Water Authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This entity is single-handedly responsible for 22% of the world's [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. From the late 1970s, [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalinated water]] capacity in the Middle East and North Africa, including the GCC, rapidly increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. By 2022, Saudi Arabia produced 2.9 million cubic meters of freshwater, and the UAE produced 2.2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | Multi-Stage Flash (MSF) Technology]]

Most mega-sized water fabs in the Gulf Coast utilize thermal-based [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] methods, predominantly [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | Multi-Stage Flash]] (MSF), which emerged in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Operating Principle
[[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | MSF]] operates on the principle that water's boiling point decreases with lower pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Unlike earlier thermal distillation systems that solely relied on raising temperature, [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | MSF]] prevents "salt scaling" – the formation of salt layers on pipes that reduces heat transfer efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This process involves:
*   **Modular Stages**: An [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | MSF]] plant consists of multiple stages, each with a low-pressure flash chamber and a condenser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Flashing**: Heated seawater enters the flash chamber, where low pressure causes a portion of it to instantly flash into steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Collection**: The steam is de-misted to remove pure water vapor, which then condenses into freshwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. The remaining saltier brine moves to the next stage for further flashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Heat Recovery**: The heat released during condensation warms incoming brine or seawater, improving efficiency and reducing power consumption by 30-35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Larger plants can have up to 40 stages, evaporating 85% of the intake water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Salt Scaling and Fouling Mitigation
To prevent salt scaling, [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | MSF]] operators:
*   Maintain a top brine temperature of 90 to 120 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   Pre-treat seawater with a de-carbonation step to remove dissolved carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   Add scale inhibitor chemicals like phosphates, which impede salt crystal growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   Perform limited washing using sponge balls that tumble through pipes for cleaning without shutting down the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Advantages of [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | MSF]]
*   **Simplicity and Robustness**: [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | MSF]] plants have few moving parts (besides conventional pumps) and minimal connecting pipes, making them robust and reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Many have exceeded their 20-year design lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Modularity**: Stages can be easily added or removed to adjust [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Raw Water Tolerance**: [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | MSF]] plants do not require extensive pre-treatment and can process low-quality seawater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Downsides of [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | MSF]]
The primary disadvantage of [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | MSF]] is its massive energy intensity, ranging from 10 to 25 kilowatt-hours or more to produce one cubic meter of desalted water, primarily heat energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. While pairing [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] plants with existing power stations can cut energy consumption by about 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, the energy requirements remain daunting. In 2014, Saudi Arabia's cogeneration plants consumed 1.5 million barrels of oil daily, or 15% of its oil production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. The economic viability of these plants in the GCC heavily relies on the region's large energy reserves and generous subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

## [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | Reverse Osmosis (RO) Technology]]

[[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | Seawater Reverse Osmosis]] (SWRO) is the dominant membrane-based [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### Operating Principle and Advantages
[[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | SWRO]] uses pressure to push salty water through a semi-permeable filter, separating salt from clean water without heating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. This makes it far less energy-intensive, requiring about 4 to 5 kilowatt-hours per cubic meter of water, roughly a third or quarter of [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | MSF]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Energy is the most significant cost factor in [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | water desalination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Consequently, since 2000, most countries outside the GCC have opted against thermal processes for [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

Other advantages of [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | SWRO]] include:
*   Compatibility with cheap and renewable energy sources like solar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   A smaller economic size threshold compared to [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | MSF]], encouraging more localized water sources and reducing the need for expensive pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

### Downsides of [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | SWRO]]
A major drawback of large-scale [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | Reverse Osmosis]] operation is the necessity for extensive pre-treatment of seawater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Silt, algae, jellyfish, salts, and decomposed organic matter can foul the membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Water is screened, sand-filtered, and treated with chlorine or anti-coagulants, which can add up to 25% to the final cost of desalted water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

### [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | Reverse Osmosis]] in the GCC
Among GCC countries, Bahrain has the highest usage rate of [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | reverse osmosis]] due to its more brackish source water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Saudi Arabia built its first [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | Reverse Osmosis]] plant in Jeddah in 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. While [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | MSF]] methods continue to dominate in the region due to past investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, mounting cost and [[environmental_concerns_of_desalination | environmental pressures]] are pushing GCC countries to explore more [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | RO-only]] and hybrid [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | RO-thermal]] systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. In 2022, the Saudi Water and Electricity Company commissioned Shuqaiq 3 on the Red Sea, one of their largest [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | reverse osmosis]] plants, with a capacity of 450,000 cubic meters per day at a cost of $600 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Privatization moves in Saudi Arabia's freshwater supply industry are expected to continue this trend towards more sustainable [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

## Brine Disposal: A Major [[environmental_concerns_of_desalination | Environmental Concern]]

A significant [[environmental_concerns_of_desalination | environmental concern]] common to both thermal and membrane [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] processes is the disposal of brine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. For every two cubic meters of freshwater produced, one cubic meter of brine is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. This brine is typically hot and 40-80% saltier than seawater, often containing heavy metals, acids, chlorine, and anti-scalant chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

Brine disposal is challenging and contributes significantly to the cost of [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]], potentially adding 5-30% to the freshwater's final cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Options are limited:
*   Burying it underground can contaminate groundwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   Dumping it at shorelines or deep underwater, even with dilution, harms local ecosystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
*   Extracting and selling salt from brine is not yet economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

These [[environmental_concerns_of_desalination | environmental issues]] associated with brine disposal are expected to worsen as the GCC's water demands increase and more mega-fabs are built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Conclusion

The vast [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] mega-fabs of the Middle East, while impressive, are increasingly recognized as problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Despite the challenges, [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] is essential for the GCC, as these countries consume 8 to 30 times more freshwater than they naturally possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

A critical issue is the intense centralization of the GCC's water systems: 50% of Saudi Arabia's [[the_process_and_technologies_of_desalination | desalination]] capacity is in just five plants, and 60% of the UAE's in four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. This concentration is not only uneconomical and [[environmental_concerns_of_desalination | environmentally dangerous]] but also poses a national security threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

A technology transition away from [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | MSF]] towards [[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | SWRO]] can encourage decentralization, bringing water supplies closer to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This shift is seen as beneficial for communities, nations, and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

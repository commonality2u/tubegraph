Undersea cables are the essential backbones of global communications, carrying gigabits of information [00:00:02]. This hyper-connected world relies heavily on these cables [00:00:10]. The design of these cables has evolved significantly to withstand the harsh marine environment.

## Early Innovations and Insulation
The first underwater experiments occurred in 1811 when German polymath Samuel Thomas von SÃ¶mmerring, while building the first telegraph network in Bavaria, wrapped a cable in rubber to cross a river [00:00:31]. This attempt failed because rubber is a water-absorbent vegetable protein, allowing water to reach the copper wire [00:00:47].

A few years later, in 1838, Irish physician and telegraph pioneer Dr. William Brooke O'Shaughnessy developed a new method to prevent water leakage [00:00:54]. His method involved wrapping the wire in rattan, a palm material, and then wrapping it again with tar-covered yarn [00:01:04]. This successfully sealed the cable and protected it from river water [00:01:13].

In 1845, the Brett Brothers proposed laying a telegraph cable from Dover, England, to Calais, France [00:01:20]. They wrapped a half-inch thick telegraph cable in gutta percha, an inert organic plastic sourced from Malaysia [00:01:28]. This cable was laid in 1850 but performed poorly 54 meters under the sea, being unprotected and weighed down by only a few lead bricks [00:01:45]. It carried only a few badly distorted telegraph signals before failing the next morning, reportedly cut by a French fisherman [00:01:56].

## Armoring and Protection
For their subsequent attempt, railway engineer Thomas Russell Crampton devised a new scheme in 1851 [00:02:05]. He wrapped the cable in steel wire, and this design performed well over the next few years [00:02:11]. This model has generally been followed by virtually every submarine cable since [00:02:21].

The core of these cables consists of one or several copper wires, insulated by gutta percha [00:02:27]. The first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable, laid in 1866, had three layers of gutta percha wrapped around all 2,500 miles of its length, using over 300 tons of the material [00:02:32]. Gutta percha was eventually replaced by the plastic polyethylene in the 1940s [00:02:47].

Around the insulated core, a cushioning layer is added, followed by the armoring steel wires first introduced by Crampton [00:02:53]. To deter bacteria in tropical waters from consuming the gutta percha, cable makers sometimes applied powdered silica or brass tape [00:03:00].

## Evolution of Communication Technologies and Cable Design
As communications technologies advanced, so did the cables [00:03:10].
*   **Telegraph cables** were succeeded by **telephone cables** [00:03:15].
*   The addition of **repeaters** in the 1940s boosted signals and improved data quality [00:03:19].
*   In the 1980s, the introduction of [[comparison_between_electrical_and_optical_data_transmission | optic fiber]] vastly increased the data bandwidth these cables could carry [00:03:25].

While tweaks were introduced to accommodate these new changes and differing environments, the main setup of modern cables remains similar [00:03:36].

### Modern Cable Variants
A number of cable variants exist, differing in their protective layers:
*   **Lightweight cables** are the industry's workhorse, featuring only steel wires wound around them and polyethylene [00:03:47]. They are best suited for shallow, safe, and stable waters [00:03:56].
*   **Lightweight Protective Cables** add more polyethylene and steel tape layers, primarily to combat animals and chafing [00:04:01].
*   **Single-armored cables** consist of a lightweight cable with a single layer of steel wire and polyethylene wrapping, providing extra protection where the risk of cable-cutting is higher [00:04:13].
*   **Double-armored cables** feature two armoring layers of galvanized steel wires around the exterior of a standard lightweight cable [00:04:26]. These "beefy" cables are deployed in shallow waters with high traffic where the cable cannot be buried [00:04:36].

## Cable Jointing
If cables are long enough, a repeater station must be added every 60 to 80 kilometers to amplify and restore the signal's shape [00:05:31]. Cables are also joined together through a delicate process called "jointing" [00:05:42]. This involves preparing the cable ends, splicing them to the new cable, and then re-encapsulating them in polyethylene and armor to 90% of their original strength [00:05:50].

## Protecting Cables
The best way to protect a cable is to dig a deep trench, place the cable within it, and cover it [00:13:22]. This is achieved using high-pressure water jets or underwater trenching machines [00:13:32]. The depth of burial, generally no more than 2 meters, depends on seabed conditions [00:13:44]. In the late 1990s, fiber optic operators created a "Burial Protection Index" to determine burial depth, though it is now considered outdated, relying instead on risk assessment [00:13:57].

If the ground is too hard for trenching, alternatives exist. **Riprap**, or rock armor, involves laying smaller rocks on top of the cable, followed by larger ones [00:14:15]. This method is effective in calm water currents [00:14:32]. Other protective measures include cover plates or casing pipes, which encase the cable [00:14:38], with additional protections like riprap layered on top if necessary [00:14:44].

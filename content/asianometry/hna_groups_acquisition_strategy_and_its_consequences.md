From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

HNA Group, a Chinese conglomerate, grew exponentially, presiding over an estimated $170 billion of assets worldwide at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This rapid expansion, achieved in just a few years, involved at least one multi-million or billion-dollar transaction each month by May 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The company's [[rise_and_fall_of_chinas_hna_group|rise and fall]] is considered one of the biggest and craziest implosions in corporate history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Early Growth and Funding

HNA's origins are rooted in Hainan Provincial Airlines, started with 10 million RMB ($1.4 million) from the Hainan government in 1988 as part of an initiative to establish regional airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Co-founder Chen Feng, a former civil aviation regulator, restructured the business as a joint stock company in 1993, allowing private individuals to buy shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This raised 250 million RMB ($35 million) from 122 stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Innovative Leveraging

To fund its operations, HNA employed a perilous strategy of debt financing. Chinese banks, unfamiliar with Western mortgage practices, assigned plane property rights directly to HNA, allowing the company to re-mortgage purchased planes to other banks for more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. HNA also borrowed against future revenue streams from air routes, effectively mortgaging each plane twice â€“ once as a hard asset and again with its projected earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This "one plane, two mortgage" approach enabled rapid growth, though it meant often taking new loans to repay existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

In 1995, Chen Feng secured a $25 million investment from George Soros's Quantum Fund, which was the first Chinese-American joint venture in the China Aviation Space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Soros's investment boosted HNA's image and confidence, with the Quantum Fund vehicle, American Aviation LDC, becoming Hainan Airlines' largest shareholder with 21% after its Shanghai stock exchange listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Soros doubled his investment to $50 million in 2005, eventually owning a stake worth $110 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. However, the Quantum Fund sold its stake in 2011 due to HNA's lack of corporate transparency and governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### Acquisitions and Diversification

In 1997, Hainan Provincial Airlines rebranded as Hainan Airlines, establishing Hainan HNA Holdings a year later, the predecessor to HNA Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. When China's Civil Air regulator reorganized state-owned aviation companies into an oligopoly in 2000, Hainan Airlines, with 31 planes, was too small to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. It arranged mergers with three smaller airlines: China Xinhua Airlines, Chang'an Airlines, and Shanxi Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The acquisition of China Xinhua Airlines in 2001 for about 1 billion RMB (mostly in assets) was key, giving HNA routes out of Beijing's airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This consolidation strategy was successful, turning a profit in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

The 2003 SARS epidemic caused HNA a massive loss of 1.5 billion RMB, pushing it near bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. The Hainan provincial government, despite its small financial stake, injected 1.5 billion RMB (10% of its entire revenue that year) in 2005, effectively saving the airline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

HNA then pursued vertical integration, positioning itself to benefit from Hainan's growing tourism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. They acquired airports (becoming the first Chinese airline to own their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>), hotels, and travel agencies, with over 40% of arrivals to Hainan coming via Hainan Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

The 2008 global financial crisis also caused HNA to incur a 1.73 billion RMB loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The Hainan provincial government again injected 1.5 billion RMB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Additionally, the Chinese government's 4 trillion RMB stimulus package in 2008, which boosted land prices, helped HNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. HNA had acquired 9,000 acres in Haikou (Hainan's capital city) when it bought Haikou Airport, and this land became immensely valuable, enabling HNA to sell 4 billion RMB of bonds and 2.8 billion RMB of stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. HNA also generated paper profits by moving assets between subsidiaries at favorable prices, such as selling a 95% stake in its Beijing HQ building to Hainan Airlines for 1.7 billion RMB after having acquired it for 600 million RMB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

## The "Super X Plan" Acquisition Frenzy (2010-2017)

Despite two near-bankruptcies, HNA launched the "Super X Plan" with the audacious goal of accumulating 1 trillion RMB of assets in just five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. From late 2010 to 2017, HNA spent billions of dollars on hotel brands, technology companies, urban real estate, and airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This frenzy peaked from 2015 to 2017, with 123 acquisitions totaling $50 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

### Key Acquisitions:

*   **Travel Industry**:
    *   Acquired Hong Kong Airlines and Hong Kong Express Airlines in 2006, giving HNA its first international routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
    *   Purchased a 48% stake in Aigle Azur Airline (France's second-oldest cargo airline) in 2012, granting access to European routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
    *   Bought minor stakes in South Africa's Comair and Brazil's Azul in 2015, despite no existing routes to those regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
    *   Acquired Swissport (cargo handler) for $2.8 billion in 2015 and Gate Group (Swiss airline catering) for $1.5 billion in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.
*   **Hotels**:
    *   Began investing in NH Hotel Group (Spanish company, Europe's third-largest hotel group) in 2011, eventually raising its stake to 29.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
    *   Purchased Carlson Hotels (owner of Radisson hotels) for an undisclosed price in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. This created a conflict of interest with NH Hotel Group, leading to HNA's removal from NH's board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
    *   Bought a 25% stake in Hilton Hotels from Blackstone for a price three times higher than Blackstone's original payment in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Logistics & Shipping**:
    *   Announced plans to create a global container shipping business with 200 ships in 2008, backed by acquisitions of Jinhai Shipyard and Tianjin Marine Shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.
    *   Tianjin Marine Shipping made the eyebrow-raising $6 billion purchase of Ingram Micro, a global IT equipment distributor, in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. This deal faced regulatory scrutiny from CFIUS but was approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.
*   **Financial Services / Leasing (HNA Finance)**:
    *   Acquired Australian aircraft leasing company Avolon (previously ALC) in 2009 after it collapsed during the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
    *   Bohai Capital, an HNA affiliate, spent $1 billion to buy GE Seaco (fifth-largest container leasing fleet) in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.
    *   Bohai paid $7.6 billion for Irish leasing company Avolon in 2016, making HNA the fourth-biggest airplane leasor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
    *   Purchased CIT Group's aircraft leasing business for $10 billion in 2017, financed largely by Morgan Stanley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. This combined company became the third-largest in the industry with 910 aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.
*   **Other Significant Acquisitions**:
    *   $1.1 billion purchase of land under the former Kai Tak airport in Hong Kong in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
    *   Majority stake in the money-losing Frankfurt Hahn airport in Germany (its only international airport acquisition) in March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.
    *   A 9.9% equity stake ($4 billion) in Deutsche Bank, making HNA its largest shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. This was built up via a complex web of seven offshore companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.
    *   $2.21 billion purchase of 245 Park Avenue in New York City in May 2017, one of the biggest real estate transactions in the city's history, mostly financed by borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.
    *   A 16.8% stake in Dufry Group, the world's largest duty-free shop chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

## Funding the Acquisition Spree

The vast majority of these purchases were funded by borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. HNA shifted from relying on mortgaging plane assets to mortgaging land development projects and other hard assets across China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. HNA partnered with provincial and city governments on infrastructure projects, leasing assets to help them duck debt limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. These land development projects were then spun off into publicly traded subsidiaries, whose skyrocketing stock prices allowed HNA's management to pledge shares for even more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.

HNA's [[financial_challenges_and_debt_management_at_hna_group|funding strategy]] was characterized by a super complex capital structure â€“ a tangled web of China-based investment entities, many of them publicly traded (10 on Shenzhen and Shanghai markets, 7 on Hong Kong markets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. As HNA acquired companies or stakes, they injected these acquisitions into their web, then re-mortgaged them for more funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. The ownership and debt links were so complicated it was hard to ascertain true ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. The company was likened to a Portuguese man-of-war â€“ an agglomeration of smaller creatures that band together, consuming anything in its way, yet entirely dependent on external currents for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

## Consequences and Implosion

In mid-May 2017, HNA issued $500 million in bonds for its 245 Park Avenue purchase, which would be one of its last overseas M&A financing transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. On June 22, 2017, the China Banking Regulatory Commission ordered risk checks on the overseas borrowing and investing of HNA and other conglomerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

This government scrutiny led to significant consequences:
*   HNA subsidiary Sherco canceled its purchase of Global Eagle Entertainment in July 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   Major banks like Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Bank of America stopped accepting HNA Group company shares as pledges for new loans, followed by Goldman Sachs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   The Hong Kong Monetary Authority requested information on HNA's financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   In November 2017, HNA issued $300 million in bonds at an extremely high 8.875% interest rate, China's highest ever for its class, as yields on HNA debt began to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   The Chinese central government criticized HNA's Sanya new airport reclamation project for "suspected illegal use of the sea," shaking confidence in the company's purported [[impact_of_government_relationships_on_hna_group|government connections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>.
*   By late November 2017, HNA reported an estimated current loan balance of 637 billion RMB ($94 billion USD), up 36% from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. Including unlisted subsidiaries, estimates reached 1 trillion RMB ($148 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. This made HNA Group Asia's most indebted company, leading to downgrades by credit rating agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.

In January 2018, HNA management announced plans to unwind its build-up and return to core airline business, aiming to sell 100 billion RMB of assets in the first half of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. A third of HNA's publicly traded affiliates had their shares suspended, including HNA Tourism Service, Bohai Leasing, Tianjin Tianhai (Ingram Micro owner), Hainan Airlines Holdings, and CCOOP Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>. Some companies had up to 60% of their total shares in circulation pledged for loans, a key source of cash for the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.

Throughout 2018, HNA began selling off assets, including plots from the Kai Tak airport site in Hong Kong for $2 billion and part of its stake in Deutsche Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. Co-founder Wang Jian, who was running day-to-day operations, died in July 2018 after an accidental fall in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. Swissport was swapped to senior creditors in August 2020, and Ingram Micro was sold to Platinum Equity in December 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

The devastating effects of COVID-19 on HNA's core airline and travel businesses sparked a final crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. On February 2021, [[hna_groups_bankruptcy_and_asset_liquidation|HNA finally entered bankruptcy proceedings]], acknowledging $170 billion of debts from creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. The company will likely be split into four businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. In September 2021, Chen Feng and his chief executive Adam Tan were detained by the Chinese government for suspected crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.

HNA's expansion was held together by mountains of debt and the unspoken implication of close government involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. While some believed HNA was a vehicle for the Chinese government, its complex structure may also have existed to dodge oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

In the initial years following World War II, Japan experienced a significant [[postwar_methamphetamine_panic_and_its_societal_effects_in_japan | panic over methamphetamine]] use, with estimates suggesting that 5% of Japanese males aged 16-25 were addicted in 1948, and 30% of those aged 20-22 had tried or were using stimulants like amphetamines and meth [00:00:03]. This crisis prompted a strong response from the Japanese government and police to control the burgeoning drug problem.

## Recognizing the Crisis

Signs of a methamphetamine crisis appeared as early as September 1946, when Tokyo's first meth addict was hospitalized [00:05:47]. Initially, there was a lack of awareness about the hazardous side effects of these drugs, which were often perceived as harmless or even beneficial for work productivity [00:07:19]. Many noted the "seeming positive upsides" of these drugs on working attitudes and stamina [00:07:41].

Two public deaths, however, began to shift public perception:
*   In October 1946, comedian Miss Wakana died of a heart attack [00:07:56].
*   In January 1947, novelist Sakonosuke Oda died of a hemorrhage [00:08:05].
Although their deaths were likely not directly due to meth overdose, newspapers seized on their known drug habits and attributed the deaths to drug abuse, helping to turn public attitudes against stimulants [00:08:08].

## Legislative Responses

By 1949, the Japanese government began to consider controls on the distribution of "hiropun" (a popular meth brand) [00:08:23]. Debates in the National Diet initially focused on street orphans who committed crimes to fund their meth habits [00:08:31]. Over time, Diet members and the Ministry of Health and Welfare concluded that the root cause was not the children but the adult dealers and smugglers [00:08:38].

Despite continued public belief in meth's role as a work productivity booster [00:08:58], the need for better controls became clear.

### Stimulant Control Act of 1951
In June 1951, Japan passed the Stimulant Control Act of 1951, which criminalized the import, manufacture, trafficking, receipt, and possession of these drugs, especially when associated with other crimes [00:10:36]. Police quickly implemented the new law, leading to 17,528 arrests for stimulant-related offenses in 1951 [00:10:52].

However, the initial law lacked sufficient "teeth," with a maximum prison sentence of only three years [00:11:00]. This led to a shift in meth production from informal labs to organized crime groups like the Yakuza [00:11:07].

### 1954 Amendment and Stricter Enforcement
By 1954, the [[japans_postwar_methamphetamine_crisis | epidemic]] worsened, with a census finding that 7.5% of respondents aged 15-30 used methamphetamine, and 75% of those injected themselves with over five vials a day [00:11:12]. The Ministry estimated over half a million abusers in the country [00:11:32].

A pivotal moment was the April 1954 violation and murder of young primary school girl Kyoko Hasada by a 20-year-old meth addict named Shikichi Sakamaki [00:11:41]. This widely publicized crime, along with other violent incidents linked to meth, generated an "avalanche of meth related headlines" [00:12:09]. The media depicted a "time of moral Decay or moral Insanity in Japan" [00:12:43].

In June 1954, Japan amended its Stimulant Control Act to crack down harder on the drug trade [00:12:48]. Arrests surged, with police apprehending 6,000 people in relation to methamphetamine within four months of the amendment [00:12:56].

## Police Operations and Public Education

The police were reorganized to focus on both demand and supply [00:13:07].
*   An all-night raid in Osaka in July 1954 involved 2,000 officers searching 800 buildings [00:13:12].
*   Indictments for stimulant-related offenses rose from 43% in 1953 to 63% [00:13:19].
*   Over 9,000 violators were jailed for stimulant offenses between 1951 and 1956 [00:13:26].

The police also invested heavily in public awareness campaigns [00:13:36]:
*   **Case Studies**: Interviews with addicts highlighted a pattern of unaware use for productivity, leading to addiction, hallucinations, and violence [00:14:41].
*   **Targeted Education**: The police aimed to educate young people, as 50% of addicts took their first dose between ages 15 and 24 [00:14:04].
*   **Mass Media**: Over 24 million yen was spent on anti-stimulant posters [00:14:18]. A total of 225,000 pamphlets, 470,000 leaflets, and 385,000 posters were distributed nationwide [00:14:25]. Posters ranged from encouraging ("Let's Wipe Out the evil of stimulant drugs") to gruesome [00:14:35].
*   **Community Outreach**: Lectures, roundtable discussions, and presentations were held in schools, factories, workplaces, and nightclubs, with a special focus on students preparing for exams [00:15:01].

A 1955 survey indicated the success of these efforts, with only 3% of youths having never heard of "hiropun" [00:15:11].

## Nationalist Narrative and Blame Allocation

During this period, blame was also directed at foreign populations, specifically Koreans and Taiwanese, euphemistically called "Third Country residents" [00:15:21]. A nationalist narrative emerged, portraying the epidemic as originating from "bad forces abroad," possibly Communists, smuggling drugs into the country [00:15:29].

In 1954, the Tokyo Police claimed that 70% of illegal meth labs were run by Koreans, though they specifically targeted Korean villages east of Tokyo for drug raids [00:15:49]. This dubious data created problems for these beleaguered ethnic minorities, who already faced discrimination and violence [00:16:01]. This narrative, however, helped shift public attitudes against [[methamphetamine_use_in_the_japanese_military_during_world_war_ii | methamphetamine]] use by framing it as a threat to Japan's future [00:15:41].

## Conclusion of the Panic

Sustained police activity led to a decline in drug crime [00:16:11]. By 1957, census cards showed a decrease in methamphetamine use, and offenses and arrests began to decline year after year [00:16:15]. By 1962, the "heropon Panic" had largely ended, with meth-related arrests falling to 300 to 800 per year [00:16:27].

However, this did not mean an end to drug use; many young people switched to sniffing solvents, leading to a surge in related crimes [00:16:37].

The causes of Japan's [[japans_postwar_methamphetamine_crisis | post-war meth crisis]] were pinpointed to abundant legal and illegal supply, a lack of awareness about the drug's addictiveness, and terrible economic conditions [00:17:01]. The combination of changing the first two elements (through legislation and awareness campaigns) and the alleviation of the third (economic recovery) helped reverse the situation and end the "heropon Panic" [00:17:13].

The "zero hour" for microelectronics technology is set at December 16, 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This date marks the discovery of the first [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]], a "game changer" that laid the foundation for modern technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Born from research in radios, radars, and telephones, the [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] replaced the [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | vacuum tube]] and ushered in the modern era of computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Beginnings: The Quest for a Vacuum Tube Replacement

For a long time, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | AT&T]] and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] sought a replacement for the [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | vacuum tube]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | Vacuum tubes]], such as the triode, were initially developed for radio and TV telecommunications due to their ability to rectify and amplify signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | tube]] system underpinned [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | AT&T]]'s extensive telephone infrastructure but also presented significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. By the late 1940s and early 1950s, a single transcontinental phone call required 12,300 [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | vacuum tubes]], primarily acting as amplifiers to regenerate weakened signals over copper lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. These [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | tubes]] were large, costly, and prone to burning out, which negatively impacted customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Recognizing these issues, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | AT&T]] began looking for a more reliable alternative as early as the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | William Shockley]] joined [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]]' [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | Vacuum Tube]] Department in 1936 to pursue this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Pre-war research focused on copper-oxide rectifiers, which convert AC to DC power for stable telephone supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Rectifiers straighten AC current, allowing it to flow freely in one direction while restricting it in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. A [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] scientist noted their similarity to how [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | vacuum tubes]] amplify signals, leading to the idea of modifying rectifiers to function as amplifiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. To this end, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell]] hired [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | William Brattain]] to work with Joseph Becker on this modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. However, early experiments failed due to a lack of proper physics grounding and the use of impure semiconducting materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Purer materials were needed for progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Wartime Progress

World War II significantly advanced semiconductor research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] served in anti-submarine research and oversaw radar system deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. While the United States initially lagged behind the British in solid-state physics for semiconductor technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, the immense resources poured into wartime semiconductor research by America closed this gap, with 30 to 40 laboratories dedicated to radar research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Crucial work during this period involved very pure germanium and silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. In 1942, a team at Purdue University, led by Professor Karl Lark-Horovitz, received a U.S. government grant to produce point-contact crystal rectifiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. These "cat's whisker" detectors, which involve pressing a thin metal wire against a semiconducting material, were advantageous for radar, especially in microwave wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. A key disadvantage was that the cat's whisker part often burned out due to impurities in the semiconducting material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Consequently, the team focused on producing extremely pure germanium and silicon crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. A single graduate student worked with the Eagle-Picher Company to refine their byproduct germanium into pure ingots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Before the war, silicon ingots were difficult to obtain with even 99% purity; after the war, American companies like DuPont achieved 99.999% purity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] also contributed, shifting existing projects to wartime radar priorities, which further stimulated semiconductor research and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Post-War Bell Labs and the Point Contact Transistor

After the war, in the spring of 1945, Mervin Kelly became [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]]' director of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Recognizing [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]]' leading position in solid-state physics, Kelly created new interdisciplinary research groups, including electrical engineers, chemists, experimentalists, and theorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | William Shockley]] co-headed one of these groups, which included [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Walter Brattain]] and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | John Bardeen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

In September 1945, a visit to Purdue convinced [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]]'s team that silicon and germanium, particularly germanium due to its lower melting temperature, were the best materials for their research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. In January 1946, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] predicted that applying a strong external electrical field to a thin layer of silicon or germanium could modulate its conductivity, allowing for the creation of a three-terminal device similar to the [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | vacuum tube]] triode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This device, if successful, would amplify a smaller current or act as a switch for 1s and 0s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] termed this the "field effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

However, experiments by [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]]'s cohorts to prove the field effect failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]], the brilliant theorist, and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Brattain]], the experimentalist, noticed the modulation was far less than predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]] hypothesized that the electrical field was being blocked at the surface of the semiconducting material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. To test this, they probed the germanium surface with two wires, but the observed behavior still defied theoretical explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### The First Transistor: A Serendipitous Discovery

After numerous experiments, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]] had an idea: what if the two probes were placed very closely together? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a> [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Brattain]] fashioned a polystyrene triangle with a narrow, flat edge, cemented gold foil onto it, and then carefully cut the gold in two at the apex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This setup was pressed onto the germanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

On December 16, 1947, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Brattain]] and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]] ran the experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Brattain]] recounted that by wiggling the setup to ensure contact with both ends of the gold, he could make one contact an emitter and the other a collector, achieving an amplification of "the order of magnitude of 100" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This "deceptively simple setup" led to the creation of their solid-state amplifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. That night, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Brattain]] felt he had performed the most important experiment of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, while the more reserved [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]] simply mumbled to his wife, "We discovered something important today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Secrecy, Announcement, and Initial Challenges

The device was immediately put into a circuit and demonstrated to [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | AT&T]] leadership a week later, where they listened to amplified speech through headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | AT&T]] kept the discovery secret for several months to patent the design and ran it by the U.S. military, who considered classifying it like the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Fortunately, they did not, as the device's general applications were too vast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. News of the [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] was publicly announced on June 30, 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The *New York Times* dryly noted its "applications in radio where a [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | vacuum tube]] ordinarily is employed," an understated description of its true potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

The announcement sparked a global rush into solid-state physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The point-contact [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]], though historically important, was an accidental discovery, and its underlying physics were not well understood at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Even a decade later, when [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]], [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Brattain]], and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] won their Nobel Prize, the precise physics remained unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

As a [[commercialization_and_global_adoption_of_transistors | commercial product]], the point-contact [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] largely "flopped" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. By 1952, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]]' sister company, Western Electric, was producing 8,400 devices a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. However, its operation relied on semiconductor surface structures, making it extremely fragile and susceptible to humidity and temperature, leading to inconsistent performance and hindering its [[commercialization_and_global_adoption_of_transistors | commercial success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

## The Junction Transistor: A Superior Design

[[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bill Shockley]] was not involved in the point-contact [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. After eight years working on the topic, he felt frustrated and was driven by a competitive desire to make his own mark in [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] also recognized the point-contact [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]]'s weak [[commercialization_and_global_adoption_of_transistors | commercial]] prospects and the underdeveloped theory behind it, intensifying his theoretical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

While [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]] and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Brattain]] demonstrated their device, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] furiously worked on his notebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. On January 23rd, he unified existing concepts with observations from the [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] discovery to create the **junction [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

The junction [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] is composed of three sections of two types of modified, or "doped," semiconducting materials: "p-type" (with an abundance of "electron holes") and "n-type" (with an abundance of electrons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. These can be arranged as N-P-N or P-N-P, and their areas are called the emitter, the base (in the middle, acting as a gate), and the collector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. The meeting points of the N-type and P-type materials are called "junctions," giving the device its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

[[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]]'s critical realization was that at these junctions, the majority charge carrier (electron or electron hole) could travel across both junctions from the emitter to the collector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This meant they flowed through the entirety of the semiconducting material, penetrating its surface, rather than just moving along the surface layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. This concept, known as "minority carrier injection," was key to creating a far more resilient and [[commercialization_and_global_adoption_of_transistors | commercially useful]] device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. By manipulating the current into the base, a much larger current flow could be controlled, allowing for signal amplification or switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

Initially, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] kept his idea secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. However, in February 1948, before the first point-contact [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] was publicly revealed, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] physicist John Shive's experimental results showed electron holes moving through the entirety of germanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] saw this as proof of his minority carrier injection concept, paving the way for a superior [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

Later, in 1950, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] chemists Gordon Teal and Morgan Sparks adopted the Czochralski process to grow long, narrow crystals of pure germanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This method, still used today for modern wafers, involves systematically dipping a small seed crystal into a melt to grow a larger crystal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. Using this, Teal and Sparks could dope the germanium crystal with P and N-type impurities to create P-N junctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. This led to the first "grown junction [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistors]]" from [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The junction [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] was immediately recognized as a superior [[commercialization_and_global_adoption_of_transistors | commercial product]] due to its sturdy, three-part "sandwich" design, unlike the fragile point-contact version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

### Shockley Triumphant and Bell Labs Dynamics

[[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] alone crafted an entirely new page of semiconductor physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]], who had worked with [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] in December 1948, critically missed the concepts behind minority carrier injection, dismissing the idea that P-N junctions could be crossed by electrons or electron holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

[[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] later published "Electrons and Holes in Semiconductor," solidifying his position as the leading figure in [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] began promoting him alongside [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]] and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Brattain]] as inventors of the [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

However, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]], known for his paranoid and difficult personality, blocked [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]] and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Brattain]] from further work on the junction [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. This led to [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Brattain]] transferring out of the solid-state physics group and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]] leaving [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] entirely to pursue superconducting theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. While [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]] won his first Physics Nobel later, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] always clarified that [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]] and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Brattain]] discovered the first [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]], not himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

## Transistor Explosion and Commercialization

In 1949, the U.S. Government sued [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | AT&T]] for antitrust violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. The resulting Consent Decree not only restricted [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | AT&T]] to phone-related business but also mandated the licensing of its discoveries, including the [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. For $25,000, domestic and foreign companies could purchase a patent license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. In September 1951, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] held its first symposium on [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] manufacturing, providing licensees with an 800-page book and samples, known as the "$25,000 book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

[[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | Vacuum tube]] companies like RCA, General Electric, Westinghouse, and Sylvania recognized the threat to their business and aggressively built up germanium [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] capacity, developing new innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. By 1951 or 1952, General Electric and RCA discovered the "alloy junction [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. This method involved melting P- and N-type pellets of indium and other materials with germanium to create junctions, proving more scalable than the "grown junction" method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

In 1953, the first [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistorized]] products entered the market, including the [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistorized]] hearing aid, which significantly shrank the device and revolutionized the experience for the hard-of-hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. News of the [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] quickly spread globally, with countries developing their own versions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. [[europes_historical_semiconductor_development_and_challenges | France]] quickly created its "transistron" by scientists Welker and Matare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. Japan's Electrotechnical Laboratory produced its first point-contact [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] in 1951, followed by its first junction [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] in 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Japan's Sony Corporation went on to [[commercialization_and_global_adoption_of_transistors | commercialize]] the [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] radio, and researcher Leo Esaki won the 1973 Nobel Prize in physics for his work on electron tunneling in semiconductor materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

## Transistors in Computers

From the outset, [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistors]] were expected to integrate into computers, promising smaller, more energy-efficient, cooler, and more reliable devices compared to the thousands of [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | vacuum tubes]] typical in 1950s computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. However, the dream was delayed as industries struggled to scale reliable [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] production, with early [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistorized]] products remaining expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

In November 1953, a team at the University of Manchester fired up a computer with 92 first-generation point-contact [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistors]], generally considered the first [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistorized]] computer, though it still contained [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | tubes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] and other companies, spurred by the military, invested heavily in making more reliable [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. The [[commercialization_and_global_adoption_of_transistors | commercialization]] of improved alloy junction [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistors]] and variants like Philco’s "surface-barrier [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]]" quickly paved the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. In May 1954, the United States Air Force received the first American [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistorized]] computer, "TRADIC" (TRAnsistor DIgital Computer), which used 700 [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistors]] to evaluate digital navigation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>.

In less than ten years, the [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistor]] evolved from a fragile lab experiment to a component flying thousands of feet in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | Transistorized]] computers are now considered second-generation devices, marking a clear division from the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

Near the end of 1954, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bill Shockley]] decided to leave [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] to start his own business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Arnold Beckman of Beckman Instruments recognized the competitive threat and convinced [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] to establish his Semiconductor Lab within Beckman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] officially resigned from [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] in September 1955 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. That year, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] held 37% of all patents issued for [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistors]], but this declined as former [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | vacuum tube]] companies aggressively entered the business, ending [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]]' status as a pioneer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

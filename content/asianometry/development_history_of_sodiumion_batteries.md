Scientists initially developed sodium-ion batteries concurrently with [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries|lithium-ion batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries|lithium]] eventually became dominant, [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium]] has seen renewed interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The global supply of [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium]] is essentially unlimited, with over 1,000 times more [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium]] than [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|lithium]] in the Earth's crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This translates to a raw ingredient [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs|cost]] of $150 per ton for [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium]], compared to [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|lithium's]] $5,000, representing a 30 times decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Early Development: Molten Salt Batteries

[[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|Development]] of [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion batteries]] began in the early 20th century with the discovery that molten salts could conduct high amounts of [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium ions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Ford's Sodium-Sulfur Battery

In 1968, scientists at the Ford Company developed the [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-sulfur battery]] for use in [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage|electric vehicles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This battery consisted of a tube of metallic [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium]] dipped into a tube of liquid sulfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Ford estimated that a 350-pound [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-sulfur battery]] could provide 200 to 300 miles of range for a 1,350-pound car at 40 miles per hour, with a minimum charge time of half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

The primary challenge for this technology was its requirement to operate at very high temperatures, specifically 570 to 660 degrees Fahrenheit (300 to 350 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. These extreme temperatures led to safety and longevity issues, particularly in cars, as aluminum-based container tubes would react with the battery chemicals and rupture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Ford ultimately did not [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries|commercialize]] the technology for [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage|electric vehicles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

Molten salt batteries, though not widely used in mobile electronics, have found applications in guidance systems for missiles and in extreme environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Ford later sold this technology to the Japanese company NGK, which now sells them as stationary battery solutions for peak energy use and grid stabilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Zebra Battery

The oil crises of the 1970s revitalized interest in this battery technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. In 1985, South African researchers created a new version of the molten salt battery called the "Zebra battery," using nickel chloride and [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium]] tetrachloroaluminate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

However, in 1989, Sony successfully [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries|commercialized]] the [[lithium_ion_battery_chemistry_and_technology|lithium-ion battery]], which quickly gained industry dominance, shifting research focus away from [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Renewed Interest

In the 2000s, concerns began to emerge regarding the limited supply of [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|lithium]] raw materials, which became a barrier to a truly carbon-free economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Additionally, the proliferation of [[the_influence_of_patents_on_LFP_battery_development|patents]] around [[lithium_ion_battery_chemistry_and_technology|lithium-ion technologies]] made it challenging for new companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. In contrast, [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion battery]] technologies offered "green fields" for intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Starting in the 2010s, researchers revisited [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion batteries]] with a focus on room-temperature operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The number of publications related to [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion batteries]] rapidly increased, even surpassing those for [[lithium_ion_battery_chemistry_and_technology|lithium-ion batteries]] in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Key Component Research

Scientists have largely converged on a few high-potential [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion battery chemistries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>:

*   **Anodes**: Most studies focus on "hard carbon" (colloquially, charcoal) for anodes, with [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries|CATL's]] hard carbon anode featuring a unique porous structure for improved cycle lifetime and [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion]] movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Electrolytes**: Researchers generally choose [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium]] salts dissolved in organic carbonate solvents, ensuring low viscosity, high conductivity, and electrochemical stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Cathodes**: This area has seen significant research focus, as the cathode is the most expensive and crucial component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
    *   **[[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|Sodium]] layered oxides**: These are a common and closely studied class of cathode material, having a crystalline structure similar to [[lithium_ion_battery_chemistry_and_technology|lithium cobalt oxide]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
    *   **Prussian white**: [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries|CATL]] has opted to use Prussian white for their cathodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Researchers noted its suitability for [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion battery]] cathodes in the early 2010s, due to good discharge rates and capacity retention over many cycles (e.g., 95% after 10,000 cycles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. A drawback is capacity loss in the presence of moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
    *   Other candidate materials include sulfides, phosphates, fluorophosphates, carbon phosphates, and vanadium-based polyanionic compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Recent Commercialization Efforts

The first commercially ready [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion battery]] was an 18650 cell created by the French research agency CNRS CEA in 2015, with an energy density of about 90 watt-hours per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. In 2017, the research was spun off into a startup called Tiamat Energy, aiming to develop low-voltage systems for [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage|hybrid vehicles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

In June 2020, researchers at Washington State University and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory announced a more advanced [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion battery]] prototype, speculating it could achieve a practical specific energy of about 160 watt-hours per kilogram, comparable to current [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology|lithium-ion phosphate batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

Several other technology startups are working to [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries|commercialize]] [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion batteries]], including UK-based Faradion Limited, Sweden-based Altris AB, China-based HiNa Battery, and US-based Natron Energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

### [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries|CATL's First Generation Sodium-Ion Batteries]]

Contemporary Amperex Technology ([[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries|CATL]]), the world's largest battery company, recently unveiled their [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries|first generation sodium-ion batteries]] for [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries|commercial use]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

[[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries|CATL]] stated that their [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries|first generation sodium-ion battery]] can achieve energy densities of up to 160 watt-hours per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Their second generation aims to surpass 200 watt-hours per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

A key advantage for [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries|CATL]] is that the engineering and manufacturing processes for [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion]] and [[lithium_ion_battery_chemistry_and_technology|lithium-ion batteries]] are similar, allowing them to integrate their [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion]] offerings into their existing [[lithium_ion_battery_chemistry_and_technology|lithium-ion infrastructure]] and product ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. While most [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs|cost savings]] will come from cheaper raw materials, end users are estimated to see 10% to 30% [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs|price savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries|CATL]] also highlighted battery system integration capabilities, allowing the mixing and matching of [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion]] and [[lithium_ion_battery_chemistry_and_technology|lithium-ion batteries]] into a single system, with [[lithium_ion_battery_chemistry_and_technology|lithium-ion batteries]] (having higher energy densities) used when [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion]] falls short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Due to [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium's]] lower ionization potential compared to [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|lithium]], [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion batteries]] typically have lower energy densities and operating voltages than their [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries|lithium counterparts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. It is uncertain if they can ever fully match top-line [[lithium_ion_battery_chemistry_and_technology|lithium-ion batteries]] in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

However, [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion batteries]] show potential in areas where space is less of a limiting factor, such as [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage|short-range electric vehicles]] and especially [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage|stationary power systems]] like energy storage for solar and wind renewables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. These large-scale applications can also greatly benefit from the [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs|cost savings]] offered by [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development|sodium-ion technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

India is recognized as a semiconductor design powerhouse, with most major semiconductor companies having a presence in the country for advanced chip design. However, once these designs are complete, they are sent to the United States, China, South Korea, or Taiwan for fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This reliance on foreign fabrication stems from the failure of India's early attempts at establishing its own semiconductor manufacturing, particularly through Semiconductor Complex Limited (SCL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Founding and Early Promise of SCL

In the 1980s, the Indian government sought to emulate countries like China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, and Singapore by creating its own "national champion" in semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While Fairchild Semiconductor had considered establishing a factory in India in the mid-1960s, the country's formidable bureaucracy deterred them, leading them to choose Malaysia and the Philippines instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Recognizing the accelerating pace of technology in the 1970s and 80s, the Indian government identified microprocessors and semiconductors as a potential foundation for a new revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Consequently, in 1984, the government founded SCL as a 100% state-owned enterprise with an investment of approximately $40-70 million USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. SCL's vision was to design and manufacture leading-edge circuits and electronics, forming the basis for a native Indian electronics industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Headquartered in Mohali, Punjab, a region emerging as an electronics industry center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, SCL recruited young graduates from top technical universities like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, which have strong links to the West and produce skilled engineering talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

SCL followed a well-established playbook for becoming a leading semiconductor manufacturer, focusing on four key categories: financial capital, human capital, government/infrastructure, and manufacturing technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

In 1984, SCL licensed a 5-micron process technology from American Microsystems Inc. (AMI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Soon after, they acquired process technology from Rockwell (for their 2560G microprocessor) and Hitachi (for electronic wristwatch components) as part of manufacturing deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. These technology transfer agreements allowed SCL personnel to receive in-person training in the U.S. and Japan, which they rapidly disseminated within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. SCL also assembled the BBC Acorn computer for the Indian government's "Computer Literacy and Studies in Schools" program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

Utilizing these resources, SCL rapidly advanced from the 5-micron process technology to a 0.8-micron process in the late 1980s, which was only one semiconductor generation behind leading companies like NTT, Toshiba, and Intel at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. At this point, it seemed plausible that India could achieve its goal of becoming a global semiconductor manufacturer within a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## The Disaster and Its Aftermath

SCL's promising trajectory ended in 1989 when a devastating fire broke out at its facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. While the cause remains unknown, fires are a common cause of operational losses in the semiconductor industry due to flammable chemicals and the corrosive gases released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The fire triggered sprinkler systems, causing further damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

The incident was a severe setback for India's semiconductor manufacturing ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. It took eight years and over $50 million USD for production to restart in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. During this period, new players like TSMC (founded 1987) and Samsung rapidly gained critical global market share and scale, leaving India far behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

The Indian government subsequently made several failed attempts to recover lost ground:
*   **Selling the Fab**: Potential private investors could not agree on terms with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Retooling Production**: The fab was retooled from making chips for telephone exchanges to smart cards, which also did not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Restructuring as R&D Center**: In 2005, SCL was restructured as an R&D center within the Department of Space, renamed Semiconductor Lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This move effectively ended SCL's chances of being a competitive commercial entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

SCL's offerings were not competitive even in the domestic Indian market, and the company struggled financially despite government contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. In the 2005-2006 financial period, it produced only 1,000 six-inch wafers despite having 20 times the installed capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. By its final year as a commercial company (2005-2006), SCL recorded a loss of $2 million USD on $3.5 million revenue, a significant decline from its 1999-2000 performance of $14 million revenue and $400,000 profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

Today, SCL primarily conducts R&D with its old 6-inch wafer fab, capable of accepting chip designs at the 180-nanometer node, a node achieved by Leadign companies in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This slow progress is critical, as it took SCL nearly a decade to reach this node, having worked on it since at least 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

## Broader Impact on India's Semiconductor Industry

Even before the 1989 fire, SCL was beginning to face the financial strain of competing in the semiconductor business, leading them to drop projects like the BBC Acorn computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Talented SCL personnel also frequently left for better opportunities in the private sector or abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

[[indias_semiconductor_import_dependency | India's primary obstacle in establishing a viable semiconductor manufacturing industry has been the immense capital required]] for competitive and productive fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Modern leading-edge chip factories can cost tens of billions of dollars, a trend that accelerated significantly around the 14-nanometer node generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. To put this in perspective, TSMC spends $20 billion on just one gigafab over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, an investment scale that is hard for even the biggest private Indian entities like Tata or Reliance to swallow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

Since SCL's initial failure, subsequent government attempts to revive the country's semiconductor manufacturing have also failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>:
*   **2006 Fab City Project**: A $3 billion project in which AMD was interested in an assembly and test facility, but it was shut down by poor industry conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **2013 Customs Duty Lift**: India lifted custom duties on all imports of parts and machinery related to semiconductor manufacturing, but this did not stimulate foundry efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **2014 Investor Proposals**: The government approved two investor groups for building fabs, projects totaling $10 billion, with government support of 25% of the cost, interest-free loans, tax breaks, and subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
    *   **JP Associates Consortium**: This group included Jai Prakash (JP) Associates, Israel's Tower Jazz, and IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. In 2016, JP Associates pulled out, citing significant debt and the commercial non-viability of a semiconductor plant at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
    *   **Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (HSMC)**: This consortium had expertise from European chipmaker STMicroelectronics and Malaysian state operator Siltera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. However, in 2019, the government canceled HSMC's letter of intent due to their failure to submit required commitment documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

As a result of these historical setbacks and ongoing challenges, [[indias_semiconductor_import_dependency | India today lacks substantial semiconductor fabrication capacity]], with virtually no capacity at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. As of this writing, 100% of India's chipsâ€”logic, memory, and all othersâ€”must be imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

In 2019, India imported $21 billion worth of semiconductors, a number growing by about 15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. The country was significantly impacted by the 2020 worldwide semiconductor shortage, which disrupted critical Indian businesses, including its role as the world's second-largest smartphone maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Furthermore, [[indias_dependency_on_china_for_active_pharmaceutical_ingredients | a significant portion of these importsâ€”37% or $7 billion in 2019â€”come from China]], creating critical geopolitical repercussions given the tense Sino-Indian relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

Despite these manufacturing challenges, India retains world-class chip design capabilities, with tens of thousands of Indian engineers working in VLSI design, and their chips being taped out in leading-edge fabs globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Virtually all major fabless chip companies have a presence in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. Since the mid-1980s, chip design and manufacturing have largely separated, making it less necessary for companies to perform both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

In conclusion, while India possesses significant human talent and innovative ideas for re-establishing semiconductor manufacturing, achieving this goal requires consistent, long-term direction from the highest levels of government and a massive, committed financial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. The market has evolved beyond a point where a private entity can seed a thriving semiconductor manufacturing industry without substantial state support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

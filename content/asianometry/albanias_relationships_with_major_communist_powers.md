From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The People's Republic of Albania was known as the most isolated country in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, this small Communist nation managed to ally with and then split from three different major Communist powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. After its final split, Albania ferociously pursued economic self-reliance, which contributed to it becoming the third poorest country globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Historical Context

Albania is a small country in Southeast Europe, about 25% smaller than Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Its terrain, which includes mountains, swamps, and forests, makes finding arable land difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Throughout its history, Albania has been influenced by foreign powers, including the Ottoman Turks who occupied the land for over 400 years until the late 1500s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Under Ottoman rule, much of the Christian population converted to Islam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

In 1912, newly established Albania was a feudal society of about a million people with underdeveloped natural resources despite having oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The country's economy was dominated by large absent landowners and lacked influence, being torn between major powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Italy gained significant influence after a secret treaty with the UK, France, and Russia in 1915 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Ahmet Zogu, a landowner, became Prime Minister with Yugoslav backing before sidling up to Fascist Italy and declaring himself King Zog I in 1928 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Italy invaded Albania on April 7, 1939, leading to an occupation that was resented by the Albanian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

During World War II, a resistance formed, split between the National Front (Nationalists) and the Communist Party of Albania (officially the Albanian Party of Labor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. The Communist Party was created in 1941 with assistance from the Communist Party of Yugoslavia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This party was led by [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Enver Hoxha]], who quickly dominated the Central Committee despite an initial collective leadership model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Albania is unique among central or Eastern European countries in having been "liberated" without Allied help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The Communists, advised by the Yugoslavs, formed the National Liberation Movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Relationship with Yugoslavia

The Communist Party of Yugoslavia played a foundational role for the Communist Party of Albania, providing military assistance and sponsoring the People's Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. In return, Yugoslavia pressed Albania to join the Yugoslav Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Yugoslavia and Albania signed close technical and economic agreements, coordinating monetary systems and education, and forming joint ventures to exploit Albanian natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Albania supplied raw materials, while Yugoslavia sold industrial goods back to Albania at inflated prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

By June 1947, Yugoslavs publicly attacked [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]] for his "anti-Marxist views," planning to replace him with Koci Xoxe, the Minister of the Interior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Stalin reportedly told Milovan Djilas in early 1948 that Yugoslavia should "swallow" Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. However, Yugoslavia's determination to acquire Albania, combined with its moves in Greece, turned Stalin against Tito <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Stalin then sent letters criticizing Tito's policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

In mid-April 1948, [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]] seized the opportunity from the [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | Soviet Union]]'s initial letter to Tito <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. In a secret meeting, the Soviets guaranteed they would prevent a Yugoslav attack on Albania and granted [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]] freedom to purge pro-Yugoslav influence from the party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This intervention saved [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]]'s leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Koci Xoxe was arrested, tried, and executed in 1949, leading to continued "liquidations" throughout [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]]'s 46-year rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

## Relationship with the Soviet Union

After 1948, Albania severed ties with Yugoslavia and joined COMECON, entering the Soviet orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. From 1949 to 1951, all of Albania's trade was with COMECON states, with the [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | Soviet Union]] accounting for half of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. The Soviets provided approximately $200 million in food and military aid between 1948 and 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. They also transferred technologies and built infrastructure, including a submarine base on Sazan island in 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Albanians viewed their association with the Soviets as an upgrade in prestige <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]] expressed immense personal admiration for Stalin, even publishing a book about their meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

Upon Stalin's death in 1953, [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Enver Hoxha]] staged a public display of grief in Tirana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. However, Nikita Khrushchev's new policies, including the repudiation of Stalin's cult of personality, the adoption of collective leadership, and reconciliation with Marshal Tito in June 1956, grated on [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

Albania began moving towards [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | China]] as early as October 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. After [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]] met with Mao Zedong in September 1956, Chinese aid to Albania increased, reaching 21.6% of Albania's total trade balance by 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. As the [[sinosoviet_nuclear_cooperation_and_its_challenges | Sino-Soviet Split]] widened, Albania's alliance with [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | China]] and its break with the Soviets became inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

The tension culminated in November 1960 when [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]] criticized Khrushchev in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. In February 1961, at the Albanian Communist Party congress, [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]] launched an economic campaign against Soviet advice, affirming loyalty only on his terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. This led the Soviets to withdraw their considerable aid, which had constituted 50% of Albania's economy from 1946 to 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. In October 1961, Khrushchev publicly called [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]] an "unreconstructed Stalinist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:19:03]</a>. Khrushchev accused [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]] of sabotaging the Soviet-Albanian relationship and wanting to preserve the cult of personality to maintain personal power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

The Soviet Union and its allies expelled Albania from the Warsaw Pact and COMECON, leaving [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | China]] as its only significant ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. Khrushchev famously summed up the situation by stating, "It is true that we lost Albania, but what you've won is nothing much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

## Relationship with China

After the split with the Soviets, [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | China]] attempted to replace Soviet aid by sending its own technicians and advisors, which Albanians received favorably due to less strict loan terms and equivalent salaries for workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | China]], also isolated, considered Albania one of its staunch allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. In November 1966, Mao Zedong declared Albania "the only beacon of true socialism left in Europe" and promised protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

Despite this, [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | China]] itself was a developing country facing one of its worst famines, and geographical distance caused delays in aid delivery, making the 1961-1965 Third Five-Year Plan challenging for Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. To maintain power, [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]] tightened his surveillance state (Sigurimi) and ramped up his personal cult of personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

The "love affair" with [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | China]] did not last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. In 1969, [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | China]] began its overtures to the West, particularly the announcement of U.S. President Nixon's trip to [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | China]] in July 1971, which shocked the Albanians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | China]] also indicated that aid might not continue indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. In response, [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]] and the Albanian Party formally criticized the meeting as revisionist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. In 1976, [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]] purged high-ranking military and Party members for pro-Chinese leanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.

After Mao's death in 1976 and Tito's invitation to Beijing in 1977, Albania escalated rhetorical attacks on [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | China]], accusing them of collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. In July 1978, [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | China]] cut off all aid to Albania, which then constituted half of the country's economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

## [[the_isolation_and_selfreliance_of_communist_albania | Economic Isolation]] and Self-Reliance

With the intensifying shortages in the mid-1960s and the final severing of ties with [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | China]], Albania's Party increasingly focused on the concept of self-reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>. This concept, fundamental in Stalinist economies, was pushed above all others due to Albania's unique situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. The government portrayed itself as special, facing "economic blockades and encirclement" from imperialist foreign powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

[[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]] declared Albania the only country still building socialism and revamped the 1976 Constitution to enshrine the principle of self-reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. For the next 12 years, the country operated without foreign aid or credit, and Albanian companies were forbidden from joint ventures with foreign countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]]'s cult of personality intensified, religion was banned, and international travel was forbidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>.

This policy led to a focus on increasing exports of primary goods like oil, chromite, copper, and electricity to acquire hard currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. Albania diversified its trade partners, including a semi-relaxation of relations with Yugoslavia and COMECON (excluding the [[chinese_and_soviet_union_relations_during_the_1970s | Soviet Union]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. The country also aimed for self-sufficiency in food production, notably achieving self-sufficiency in bread grain by 1976 by draining swamps and expanding arable land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

Despite these efforts, the country fell into deep [[economic_policies_and_challenges_under_communist_rule | economic stagnation]] throughout the 1980s, with average annual growth of 1.7%, effectively making the average Albanian poorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. Equipment from the Soviets and Chinese became obsolete and broken, and attempts to rebuild machinery locally cost more than buying new from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. The population suffered severe rationing and limited access to basic services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. The country's technology was decades behind, with one visitor in 1984 noting Albanian tractors were from the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. The borders were heavily militarized to prevent escape, with 1,200 people killed trying to leave over 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.

## [[the_decline_and_fall_of_communist_albania | The Decline and Fall]]

[[the_isolation_and_selfreliance_of_communist_albania | Self-reliance]] ultimately led to [[economic_policies_and_challenges_under_communist_rule | economic stagnation]] and decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. After [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]]'s death in 1985, his successor, Ramiz Alia, attempted gradual economic changes, slowly backing away from the self-reliance philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>. Alia established diplomatic relations with West Germany, Spain, and Canada, reduced death penalty offenses, and relaxed travel restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.

However, these reforms were insufficient, and the Secret Police lost its grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. By 1989, Communist governments across Eastern Europe were collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>. Massive protests erupted in 1990, and law and order broke down, leading to widespread looting and further economic damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. Alia's final attempts at reform failed, and he called for free elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. In March 1992, the Democratic Party won power, and [[enver_hoxhas_rise_to_power_and_leadership_style | Hoxha]]'s statues were torn down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>.

Albania's pursuit of total economic [[the_isolation_and_selfreliance_of_communist_albania | self-reliance]] ultimately led to anti-development and extreme poverty, despite being blessed with natural resources and a strategic position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. After 1992, Albania underwent one of the fastest transitions to capitalism, but a profound need for further economic reform remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.

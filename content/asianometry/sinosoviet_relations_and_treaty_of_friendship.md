On October 16, 1964, the People's Republic of China (PRC) detonated its first domestically produced atomic bomb, joining the United States, Soviet Union, and Great Britain as one of the five Atomic Powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This achievement, taking less than five years to produce a working nuclear weapon, was influenced by the complex [[relations_with_other_communist_powers | Sino-Soviet relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Early Diplomatic Relations and Fears of Nuclear Blackmail

Mao Zedong and the Chinese party leadership feared potential American nuclear intervention during the Chinese Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. When Mao visited Stalin in December 1949 to negotiate China's entry into the Soviet Bloc, he sought the assurance of a "nuclear umbrella" for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The Soviets, who had recently broken the Western nuclear monopoly, were initially reluctant to explicitly grant such protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual Assistance (1950)
The original text of the Sino-Soviet Treaty stipulated that "in the event of an invasion of one of the signatory countries by a third country, the other signatory country shall render assistance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Zhou Enlai suggested adding the clause "with all means at its disposal," which the Soviets initially resisted but eventually accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. No explicit mention of nuclear weapons was made in formal writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The meaning of these clauses was tested during the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. As American forces approached the Yalu River, the border between North Korea and China, the Chinese worried about a potential invasion of communist China and the use of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Chinese leadership decided to intervene, believing their manpower advantage and that the Americans would not risk all-out nuclear warfare with the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Mao's gamble proved correct; Americans did not use nuclear weapons, though they threatened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

After the Korean War, the United States continued to hold the nuclear threat over China, which Chinese leadership referred to as "nuclear blackmail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Comments from U.S. officials, such as Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and General Curtis LeMay, who suggested dropping bombs in China, fueled this concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. During the first Taiwan Strait crisis (late 1954-1955), the U.S. military recommended using nuclear weapons, though President Eisenhower refrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The signing of a mutual defense treaty between the U.S. and the Republic of China (Taiwan) in December 1954 further emboldened the Kuomintang (Gomidan), intensifying China's desire for its own atomic weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## [[soviet_assistance_in_chinas_nuclear_program | Soviet Assistance in China's Nuclear Program]]

Initially, China's new nuclear program sought help from the Soviets, who were China's largest external trading partner, providing loans and assistance with industrial development projects, missiles, aircraft, and other military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

The PRC had been aware of the Soviet nuclear program since 1949. A Communist Party delegation led by Liu Shaoqi visited Stalin, asking to tour nuclear installations, but Stalin instead showed them a nuclear testing documentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. While alive, Stalin never transferred atomic technology beyond the "protection" of their nuclear umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Khrushchev's Shift in Policy
Following Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev became the leader of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Khrushchev, seeking Chinese support to boost his domestic influence and advance de-Stalinization, expressed the importance of helping China develop its industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In October 1954, Mao Zedong asked Khrushchev for assistance with China's nuclear weapons program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Khrushchev was surprised and initially sought to dissuade China, urging them to focus on economic development, reiterating the existing Soviet nuclear umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. However, the Chinese insisted, and the Soviets eventually agreed to cooperate on peaceful atomic energy use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

In April 1955, the PRC and the Soviet Union signed the Sino-Soviet Atomic Cooperation Treaty. Under this treaty, the Soviets agreed to provide China and other Eastern European countries with an experimental nuclear power plant (6,500-10,000 kilowatt) and a cyclotron (12.5-25 MeV) at a cost of 430 million rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Soviet nuclear experts were sent to China, showing films, lecturing to Chinese scientists, and exploring uranium reserves in Xinjiang. Any useful uranium would be prioritized for Chinese domestic use, with surplus exported to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. By February 1956, Khrushchev expanded cooperation, sending more Chinese students to the Soviet Union and aiding in building nuclear research facilities in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

Despite these collaborations, Mao and his colleagues viewed the alliance as one of convenience, expecting it to end, and thus sought to maximize transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. China significantly increased its science research funding, from $15 million in 1955 to $100 million in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The Chinese nuclear program also benefited from the return of Chinese-born scientists educated in the West, including Dr. Qian Xuesen (co-founder of Jet Propulsion Lab), Chen Weitong, Chen Sanchang, and Peng Huanwu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

> [!INFO] Soviet reluctance on weapon-specific technology
> Up until 1957, Soviet transfers were helpful for accelerating reactor design for peaceful atomic energy, but the Chinese largely already knew how to produce accelerators and nuclear reactors from published Western literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Nuclear weapon development, however, required special techniques and infrastructure, and the Soviets initially resisted sharing design or production knowledge for the weapons themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Agreement on Atomic Bomb Technology Transfer (1957)
In late October 1956, anti-communist protests in Hungary and Poland weakened the Soviets, making them more dependent on their primary foreign ally, China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. As a result, in 1957, Khrushchev decided to transfer atomic bomb technology to China, despite advice from his military and Ivan Kurchatov (father of the Soviet Atomic program) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

In October 1957, China and the Soviets signed an agreement for the "production of new weapons and military technology equipment and establishment of a comprehensive atomic energy industry in China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This agreement promised a teaching model atomic bomb with designs and documentation, along with technology for casings, processing uranium and plutonium, and testing guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Ambiguity of Soviet contributions
> The actual helpfulness of these transfers to the Chinese nuclear weapons program remains a complex question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Khrushchev later claimed the Soviets shared "almost everything" and "kept no secrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. However, Soviet scientists were instructed to limit disclosures, and Chinese officials were not impressed, particularly with nuclear weapon design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. A Soviet lecture in July 1958 on nuclear weapon theory, structure, and assembly provided only a basic sketch on a blackboard to mostly administrative personnel, with no parameters, formulas, or notes allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. The Chinese later claimed this lecture contained "completely wrong data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Dr. Chen Sanchang noted that the information was similar to what could be obtained from capitalist countries, with "a few more details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The subsequent [[chinavietnam_historical_relations | Sino-Soviet split]] incentivized both sides to portray their contributions differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

Regardless, the scale of technology transferred was massive. The two countries collaborated on prospecting and mining efforts for uranium, with the Soviets assisting with aerial surveys and prospecting labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. China claimed Soviet aid in this area was not particularly helpful, as they pushed prospecting in sedimentary soils, while China's best uranium deposits were found in granite and igneous rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. The Soviets also transferred their R-12 intercontinental ballistic missile to China for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

### Key Facilities for Nuclear Material Production
China initially pursued a dual-track approach to bomb design, using both uranium-235 and plutonium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Uranium-235 Bomb:** Required a gaseous diffusion plant to separate uranium-235 from uranium-238 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. The Soviets deeply influenced this part of the production line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. China's gaseous diffusion plant was located in Lanzhou City, Gansu Province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Plutonium Bomb:** Required a nuclear fuel reactor to produce plutonium-239 from uranium-238, followed by chemical separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. China built an integrated plutonium fuel facility, utilizing an early Soviet design for its reactor and chemical separation plant, in the Jiuquan prefecture of Gansu Province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

This period of deep military technology cooperation lasted from 1957 to 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

## The Sino-Soviet Split and Its Impact

The [[chinavietnam_historical_relations | Sino-Soviet split]] was a complex process with early issues emerging in 1956, particularly after Khrushchev's secret speech criticizing Stalin, which infuriated Mao Zedong, who viewed it as an indirect attack on himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

In November 1957, at the Moscow Conference of world Communists and workers' parties, Mao Zedong controversially stated that if half of mankind died in a nuclear war, the other half would remain, imperialism would be destroyed, and the world would become socialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. These comments dismayed Khrushchev and Soviet leadership, leading to a decision in early 1958 to renege on the promised teaching bomb prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. The Soviets cited security concerns and later claimed sending the prototype would strain relations with the West, indefinitely postponing its transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

The Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958, initiated by Mao, further threatened nuclear war and reinforced Khrushchev's belief that Mao was consciously trying to provoke a global conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

In June 1959, Khrushchev informed China of the termination of military cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Soviet military advisors were recalled, with the last one leaving in July 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Ultimately, 40% of the equipment and raw materials promised by the Soviets never arrived, and only a minority of the 30 Sino-Soviet nuclear industry projects were completed, forcing China to restart many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[Soviet Unions historical technology gap | Chinese Perception of Soviet Aid]]
> The withdrawal was a blow, but not entirely unexpected by the Chinese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. A PLA leader had informed the Central Committee that the Soviets aimed to maintain a technical gap with China, rendering their technical aid untrustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

In January 1960, China initiated the "596 project," named to commemorate the "shameful date" of the Soviet aid withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. Zhou Enlai vowed that China would achieve a breakthrough in three years, master technical know-how in five, and have a stockpile of bombs in eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Amidst the economic and social pressures of the Great Leap Forward, China abandoned the dual-track approach, postponing the plutonium bomb method to focus solely on the uranium-235 design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

Despite the Soviet withdrawal, Chinese technicians at the Lanzhou facility picked up the slack, sorting and sourcing tens of thousands of materials for the uranium-235 production line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. By the end of 1961, the Lanzhou plant's machinery was successfully installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The Chinese found substitutes for many Soviet components, including a special lubricant the Soviet advisors had kept locked away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. By mid-1963, Lanzhou scientists were successfully isolating uranium-235, achieving 90% enrichment by January 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

China chose an implosion design for its first bomb, similar to the one dropped on Nagasaki, but using uranium-235 instead of plutonium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. By the time the Soviets left in 1960, Chinese scientists had completed theoretical work and were ready for design, aided by some "sloppy shredding" of critical papers by the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. By the end of 1962, they mastered implosion theory, and by 1963, had the final design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. In late 1963, uranium arrived at the manufacturing plant in Subei, Gansu Province, where it was machined into a ball and packaged into the "596 bomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

China's successful nuclear test caught both the Americans and Soviets by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. The U.S. had underestimated China's nuclear effort, particularly their choice of an implosion bomb using uranium, and only realized their mistake on the eve of the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

China's indigenous nuclear bomb program was a massive undertaking, involving hundreds of thousands of people, over 900 facilities, and costing an estimated 10.7 billion RMB (4.1 billion USD in 1957 prices) over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. These costs were incurred during the economically difficult years of the Great Leap Forward and early 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

Scholars debate the extent of Soviet technological benefit to the Chinese program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. Deng Xiaoping reportedly stated in 1966 that if the Soviets hadn't broken the treaty, China wouldn't have built the bombs so fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. While Soviet aid was substantial, their withdrawal left much more to be done, yet the "sting and shame" of the abrogated treaty spurred the Chinese to finish the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.

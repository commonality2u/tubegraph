The development of the Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), later rebranded as the SpaceJet, faced significant challenges and delays primarily due to issues related to design changes, supply chain management, and certification processes. After six delays, over ten years of development, and nearly nine billion dollars spent, Mitsubishi announced in 2020 that the program would be frozen, leading to its effective insolvency [00:00:00]. This case highlights the complexities involved in modern commercial aircraft development, particularly for new entrants.

## Early Design and Material Shifts

Initially, Mitsubishi's MRJ design incorporated wings swept back at a drastic angle, aiming for improved performance [00:07:50]. This design necessitated a stronger wing, more laminated layers, and reliance on significant percentages of carbon-based composite materials, primarily in the main wings [00:07:57]. It was likely anticipated that Boeing's exclusive carbon composite supplier in Japan, Toray, could be utilized [00:08:10].

However, by September 2009, the project's design was altered. The main wings were changed to aluminum, with only the rear wings retaining carbon composites, reducing the overall composite percentage from 30% to 10-15% [00:08:20]. The exact reason for this design change is not entirely clear but could stem from a lack of "slack" in the supply chain, as Toray might not have been able to deliver complex composite materials quickly enough [00:08:36]. Another suggested reason was design-related: regional jets undergo more frequent takeoffs and landings, and while composites are strong against stretching forces, they are weaker against the high-impact forces experienced during these phases [00:08:48]. This initial design change led to the program's first delay, pushing the first flight to the second quarter of 2012 and deliveries to early 2014 [00:09:04].

## Supply Chain Difficulties

Building an aircraft requires integrating about a million individual parts, three times more than a commercial car, with these parts being far more precise and difficult to manufacture, often by a small group of specialized suppliers [00:11:15]. Over the next three years (2011-2014), Mitsubishi struggled to establish its supply network for the MRJ [00:11:09].

Unlike established giants like Boeing and Airbus, which build hundreds of planes annually and can leverage economies of scale to secure lower prices, Mitsubishi faced challenges [00:11:44]. Suppliers often had to build parts without guaranteed economies of scale, leading to higher costs. Mitsubishi sometimes paid twice as much as Boeing for a particular part [00:11:51]. The inability to acquire parts when needed halted manufacturing progress, leading to schedule shifts [00:11:34].

This [[Global competitiveness in regional jet manufacturing|supply chain]] challenge resulted in the program's second delay, announced in April 2012, pushing the first flight to the third quarter of 2013 and deliveries to mid-2015 [00:11:58]. A year later, in August 2013, the company announced its third production delay, stating a need for more time to work with supply partners, moving first delivery to mid-2017 [00:12:57]. The high cost of parts also forced Mitsubishi to raise its sales target from 1,000 to 1,500 units to break even [00:12:37].

## Certification, Documentation, and Internal Processes

Even after the first plane's assembly was completed in October 2014 [00:13:13] and its first flight took place in November 2015 [00:13:46], significant hurdles remained, particularly in flight tests and certification. The plane needed to pass internal flight tests and then critical type certification flights, requiring at least 2,500 hours of testing, mostly in the United States [00:14:10].

During these tests, misinterpretations frequently occurred, and the company was hampered by a lack of proper documentation [00:15:16]. Engineers had adopted varied approaches, for instance, in electric wiring, without standardized records [00:15:23]. This directly led to the fifth delay [00:15:28]. Following the TWA Flight 800 incident in 1996, the FAA had tightened aircraft wiring certifications [00:15:30]. Mitsubishi's engineering team, lacking proper documentation for their wire design, could not explain their methodology to regulators [00:15:49]. Rather than re-working 23,000 wires individually, the company opted for a total internal redesign of the wiring, pushing delivery dates to mid-2020 [00:16:00]. Four of the five delays by this point were attributed to a "sloppy lack of documentation" [00:16:18].

In response, Mitsubishi restructured its organization, hiring more foreign engineers with aircraft experience and empowering them to make changes [00:16:35]. The president of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Miyanaga, took more direct control, and the subsidiary's president retired [00:16:45].

## Rebranding and Scope Clause Impacts

In June 2019, Mitsubishi rebranded the MRJ as the Mitsubishi SpaceJet, redesigning the MRJ70 into the SpaceJet M100 [00:17:01]. This change was largely in response to concerns from its biggest customers, American regional airlines like SkyWest and Trans States Holdings, which together held 70% of the order book [00:17:15]. These airlines often operate under major carriers, whose pilot unions have "scope clauses" that restrict aircraft seat numbers and maximum takeoff weight to protect pilots' earnings from cheaper regional flights [00:17:35]. Adding a few feet to the MRJ70 to create the M100 was an attempt to fit these clauses, but it further impacted the delivery schedule [00:17:56].

In January 2020, Mitsubishi announced a sixth delay, pushing deliveries from mid-2020 to 2021 or beyond, as the new design required additional certification [00:18:03].

## Conclusion

The [[Failures and challenges in Japanese commercial aircraft industry|Mitsubishi SpaceJet]] program's journey reflects the immense difficulty of building cutting-edge commercial aircraft. Despite making progress in the jet's development from 2003 to 2020, a combination of design changes, struggles with building a robust [[Global semiconductor supply chain dynamics|supply chain]], and critical failures in documentation and certification processes led to repeated delays and ballooning costs [00:19:17]. These internal challenges were compounded by external factors, including the impact of the pandemic on global air travel and certification delays [00:18:21]. The program's eventual pause in development and the near-total reduction of staff [00:19:02] indicate its functional demise, with a massive loss of experience, talent, and resources [00:20:07].

The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ), later rebranded as the SpaceJet, faced a challenging development journey. After six delays, over ten years of development, and an expenditure of nearly nine billion dollars, Mitsubishi announced in 2020 that the program's development would be frozen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The program has not been revived since, and Mitsubishi Aircraft, the subsidiary responsible for the plane, has become insolvent, operating with a skeleton crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This marked a significant setback for [[challenges_in_japans_aircraft_industry | Japan's first indigenous commercial aircraft]] in nearly half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Japan's Aircraft Industry Post-WWII

Before World War II, Japan possessed a vibrant aircraft industry with companies like Mitsubishi, Hitachi, Fuji, and Kawasaki involved at the government's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. However, most projects were military-focused, leading to a halt in industrial development after Japan's defeat in WWII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This interruption caused Japan to lag in the technological transition from propeller planes to jets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Furthermore, due to their previous government-centric service, these companies lacked commercial competitiveness and experience selling to airliners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Japan's sole post-war attempt at building a commercial plane was the NAMC YS-11, a turboprop airliner that first flew in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) encouraged a consortium of Japanese companies to design and build it to replace Douglas DC-3s on domestic routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Production of the YS-11 ran for a decade until 1974, selling approximately 161 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Despite continued use by Japan's Self-Defense Forces, the project incurred a $600 million loss and was deemed a failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. However, this experience allowed Japan to join Boeing's supplier network, with the country eventually becoming a major supplier to Boeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The commercial plane industry, however, largely consolidated in the United States and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## The Regional Jet Market

Commercial air travel primarily uses three types of planes: large jets (100+ passengers), smaller turboprop planes, and regional jets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Regional jets bridge the gap, typically seating up to 100 passengers and offering longer range than turboprops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. In the United States, they are crucial for feeding passengers to major hub-and-spoke airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The first regional jets emerged in the early 1990s, replacing older turboprop models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. While the British Aerospace 146 was a pioneer, [[market_competition_in_regional_jet_sector | Canada's Bombardier]] and [[market_competition_in_regional_jet_sector | Brazil's Embraer]] dominated the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. More recently, new competitors like Russia's Sukhoi Superjet 100 and China's Comac ARJ21 have entered the space, aiming to capitalize on what was a growing market before 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Conception of the Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ)

Japanese industry observers saw an opportunity to establish a flagship technology in this market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. In 2003, the modern-day Japanese MITI, now the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry, launched a five-year, $400 million program to study an indigenous regional jet for 30 to 90 passengers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The initial plan for 30-50 seats was upscaled to 70-90 seats after analysts projected greater market demand for this category, estimating over 4,500 units in 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) was chosen to lead the project, exhibiting a concept in 2007 and officially launching the program in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Mitsubishi, in partnership with Toyota and other companies, founded the Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This marked Japan's first commercial aircraft project in nearly 50 years, with Mitsubishi itself not having developed a commercial plane since the MC-20 in 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Despite this, MHI is Japan's largest military supplier, experienced in fighter jet production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Japanese companies, including MHI, contribute 35% of an average Boeing 787, including critical parts like main wings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This existing expertise bolstered Japan's confidence in ascending the value chain to build their own plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

Mitsubishi aimed for a 20% market share of the 4,500+ unit 70-90 seat regional jet market, planning two specifications: the MRJ90 (85-90 passengers) and the MRJ70 (70-80 passengers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The jet was positioned as a high-tech, stylish, and comfortable passenger jet with spacious overhead bins and large windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Designed for fuel efficiency, the MRJ claimed a 20-30% fuel reduction over competitors, marketing itself as "the world's greenest craft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The Japanese government subsidized the development of key technologies, such as carbon composite molding and advanced aerodynamic design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Program Milestones and Delays

The MRJ program had three main milestones: finalizing design, building the supply chain and manufacturing for the first flight, and passing flight tests for certification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The original 2008 plan targeted a 2013 launch date with a $1.3 billion development budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Around 300-400 units needed to be sold to cover development costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Mitsubishi secured orders from airlines like Japan Airlines, ANA, and U.S.-based SkyWest and Eastern Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. However, attempts to secure government orders from the Ministry of Land, Coast Guard, or Ministry of Defense were unsuccessful, with the Coast Guard opting for a different aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### First Delay: Design Changes (2009)

To meet the 2013 launch, the first aircraft needed to be ready for flight tests by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The initial design featured drastically swept-back wings made with a significant percentage (30%) of carbon-based composite materials, likely intending to utilize Boeing's exclusive Japanese supplier, Toray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. However, in September 2009, the design changed: main wings became aluminum, and only rear wings used carbon composites, reducing the overall composite percentage to 10-15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. The reason for this change is unclear but may relate to supply chain constraints from Toray or a design suitability issue, as composites are strong against stretching but weak against the high-impact forces of frequent regional jet takeoffs and landings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This change caused the first six-month delay, pushing the first flight to Q2 2012 and deliveries to early 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

Mitsubishi and Boeing have a long-standing alliance, partly due to political requirements for Boeing to allocate production to Japanese manufacturers, facilitating technology transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Boeing considered investing in Mitsubishi Aircraft but ultimately offered strategic and technical consultation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This made sense for Boeing, as they do not produce regional jets, and the MRJ could replace 737s for ANA, a critical Japanese market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. In 2010, a Boeing executive suggested Mitsubishi Aircraft use the 737 cockpit for the MRJ, which would have saved time and costs by leveraging Boeing's supply network and reducing pilot training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. However, Japanese government policy required at least 30% domestic sourcing for the plane, a percentage that would be harder to meet if Boeing's cockpit were used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This policy aligns with [[comparison_between_mitsubishi_spacejet_and_chinas_arj21 | China's indigenous regional jet]], the ARJ21, which made its maiden flight in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### Second and Third Delays: Supply Chain and Costs (2012-2013)

In 2010, Mitsubishi locked the plane's design and began manufacturing, with assembly starting in April 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. For the next three years, Mitsubishi struggled to build its supply network for the MRJ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. A single plane has about a million precise parts, three times more than a car, often made by a small group of suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Unlike Boeing, who can secure parts easily, Mitsubishi often had to wait and pay significantly more, sometimes twice as much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This led to the second delay announced in April 2012, pushing the first flight to Q3 2013 and deliveries to mid-2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

Despite a significant order from SkyWest Airlines in late 2012 for 100 MRJ90s with an option for another 100, a $4.2 billion deal, the program remained in the red due to high part costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Mitsubishi had to increase its sales target from 1,000 to 1,500 units, with a break-even point of 750 planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. By this point, 407 planes (including options) had been ordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. In August 2013, the company announced its third delay, pushing first deliveries two more years to mid-2017, citing the need for more time with supply partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Rollout, First Flight, and Fourth Delay (2014-2015)

In October 2014, Mitsubishi held its rollout ceremony, signifying the completion of the first plane's assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This was a major event for Japan, with press, executives, and government officials attending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. The first flight occurred a year later in November 2015 at Nagoya Airport, accompanied by three Japanese military aircraft. The flight lasted 87 minutes, reaching 15,000 feet, and appeared successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

However, significant work remained for customer deliveries, including internal flight tests, and crucial type certification (TC) flights, which required at least 2,500 hours, mostly in the U.S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Officials would scrutinize nearly 400 line items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This realization led to the fourth delay, pushing first deliveries another year to Q3 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This timing was critical, as it coincided with the release of Embraer's E2 series, which used the same Pratt & Whitney engine, eliminating the MRJ's projected 20% fuel consumption advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. By 2016, the MRJ program budget had swelled to nearly $3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

### Fifth and Sixth Delays: Documentation and Rebranding (2018-2020)

Over the next two years, the plane underwent flight tests and was exhibited at shows in Singapore and the UK, with test planes visiting various airports in the U.S. and Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. However, the TC tests proved challenging due to frequent misinterpretations and a lack of proper documentation, leading engineers to adopt disparate approaches, particularly in electric wiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This directly caused the fifth delay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Following the TWA Flight 800 crash in 1996, the FAA had tightened aircraft wiring certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. Mitsubishi's engineering team, lacking proper documentation for their wire design, could not explain their wiring to regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Rather than rework 23,000 wires individually, the company decided to redo the entire wiring system, which was tantamount to a total internal redesign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This pushed delivery dates to mid-2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

Four of the five delays stemmed from a lack of proper documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. MHI President Miyanaga admitted that he "should have learned a little more about pre-development information gathering and risk analysis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. In response, Mitsubishi reorganized its structure, hiring foreign engineers with aircraft experience and giving them decision-making authority, while Miyanaga took more direct control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. At this point, profitability for the program seemed unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

In June 2019, the MRJ was rebranded as the Mitsubishi SpaceJet, with the MRJ90 becoming the SpaceJet M90, and the MRJ70 reworked into the SpaceJet M100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This was done to address concerns from major U.S. regional airline customers, such as SkyWest and Trans States Holdings (TSH), who collectively accounted for 70% of the order book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. These airlines operate under "scope clauses" from unionized major airline pilots, which restrict regional jet seat numbers and maximum takeoff weight to protect pilots' earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. The design changes to comply with these clauses naturally impacted the delivery schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. In January 2020, Mitsubishi announced the sixth delay, pushing deliveries to 2021 or beyond, as the new design could not acquire certification sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

## Program Suspension and Outlook

Simultaneously, the global COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted air travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. In March 2020, an M90 unit's type certification flight was delayed due to pandemic lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. In May 2020, MHI reported its first quarterly loss in 20 years, halved its SpaceJet development plan, postponed production, reduced personnel, and closed U.S. development centers, moving work back to Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

In October 2020, Mitsubishi announced a three-year management plan: all development of the SpaceJet M90 would be paused, and 95% of Mitsubishi Aircraft employees would be laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. The company would only maintain certification documentation while awaiting an anticipated air travel recovery in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

The [[impact_of_delays_on_mitsubishi_spacejet | SpaceJet program's difficulties]] reflect the immense challenges of building cutting-edge commercial aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Despite the setbacks, the jet was making progress from 2003 to 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. A [[comparison_between_mitsubishi_spacejet_and_chinas_arj21 | comparison to China's ARJ21]] is insightful: the ARJ21 made its maiden flight in 2008, six years after its 2002 start, similar to the SpaceJet's six-year path to its maiden flight (2008-2015) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. The ARJ's first commercial flight was in 2016, eight years after its maiden flight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. The SpaceJet might have beaten that timeline had it not been for the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

The program's liquidation and three-year pause have resulted in a massive loss of experience, talent, and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. The program is now functionally dead, and reviving it would require significant effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

The AT&T Consent Decree played a pivotal, albeit unintended, role in the widespread [[the_spread_and_influence_of_unix_in_academia_and_industry | distribution of Unix]], particularly within academic and research institutions.

### Background of the Decree
In 1956, AT&T settled an anti-trust lawsuit filed by the US government, leading to the **1956 AT&T Consent Decree** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:14">[08:43:14]</a>.

### Stipulations of the Decree
This settlement had two key stipulations that directly impacted Unix:
*   **Invention Sharing**: In exchange for a legal monopoly on the US telephone system, AT&T was required to make all its inventions available to the academic community at no charge, or license them for fair and reasonable terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.
*   **Exclusion from Computer Business**: The Consent Decree also explicitly barred AT&T from entering the computer business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:14">[09:05:14]</a>.

### Impact on Unix Distribution
Because of the decree, a computer operating system like Unix was not commercially viable for AT&T <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:08">[09:10:08]</a>. This meant that Bell Labs and AT&T did not "zealously guard" Unix's source code, unlike other software companies of the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:26">[08:24:26]</a>. Instead, they sold the Unix source code to nonprofits, such as universities, for a nominal fee of a few hundred dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:03">[08:15:03]</a>. This low cost, coupled with the ability to modify the code, stood in stark contrast to commercial software products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:26">[08:24:26]</a>.

Wary of violating the decree, AT&T managers actively shied away from providing support to their licensees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:06">[09:36:06]</a>. This lack of official support, paradoxically, proved to be a "piece of fortune" for Unix's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. It encouraged university students, who had "more cleverness and time than money," to collaborate and implement desired features themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. This collaborative environment fostered innovation and contributed to Unix's rapid evolution and adoption.

### Historical Precedent
The Consent Decree had a precedent in facilitating the spread of groundbreaking technology; a few decades earlier, it had also facilitated the widespread adoption of the transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:20">[09:15:20]</a>. This demonstrates a pattern where legal constraints on AT&T inadvertently promoted technological advancement outside its core business.

### Conclusion
Ultimately, the AT&T Consent Decree ensured that Unix, which began as an internal tool at Bell Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:10">[06:48:10]</a>, was readily accessible and modifiable by the academic community. This unique circumstance prevented the [[the_commercialization_and_variants_of_unix | commercialization and variants of Unix]] by AT&T directly, paving the way for its independent [[the_origins_and_development_of_unix | development]] and widespread proliferation, particularly through initiatives like Berkeley Unix (BSD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:45">[09:59:45]</a>. This allowed Unix to become a fundamental platform for software development, laying the groundwork for its future commercial success by other entities, including [[history_and_formation_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:30">[14:02:30]</a>.

At its peak, Indonesia's Salim Group was a $22 billion giant, the country's biggest business group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Its founder, Lim Soe Liong, also known as Sudono Salim, was Southeast Asia's richest man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The Salim Group's ascent was built on [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Lim's personal connection]] to authoritarian leader [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]], who was a close friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Few companies dominated a single country like Salim's companies did Indonesia until the Asian financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Early Life and Arrival in Indonesia
Born Lin Xiaolian, Lim fled the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1938 at the age of 21, arriving on the shores of Java <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Although not penniless, he relied on a thriving network of family and ethnic clan members for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. At this time, Indonesia was a Dutch colony, with an economy focused on commodity exports and dominated by Dutch businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Lim started as an ethnic Chinese trader, initially selling clothes before co-founding a coffee grinding business with his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

During Japan's occupation of Indonesia, Lim, being ethnic Chinese, was under suspicion and was once arrested for possessing a gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Despite this, he survived by selling various goods, including fermented tofu, peanuts, rice wine, and fruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Connection to [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]]
After Japan's occupation ended in 1945, the Dutch attempted to reimpose colonial rule, but a nationalist movement led by Sukarno and Muhammad Hatta sparked a four-year revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Lim launched a supplies business, smuggling essentials like soap, coffee, sugar, and rice to the Republican Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. He also allegedly ran guns and ammunition, though he denies this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. While working in Central Java, Lim impressed soldiers of a military unit, leading their logistics officer, Cilardi, to introduce him to his cousin, [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Indonesia gained independence in December 1949, with Sukarno as its first president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Challenges for Chinese Minority
The early years of independence under Sukarno were difficult for foreign investors and the Chinese ethnic minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Sukarno's socialist leanings and suspicion of foreign capital led to policies aimed at indigenizing foreign businesses, including the seizure of all Dutch assets in 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Despite warming relations with China, Indonesian Chinese minorities faced discrimination and violence due to resentment over their business dominance and perceived support of the Dutch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. In 1952, facing racial discrimination in rural areas, Lim moved to Jakarta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Rekindling with [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]]
In 1956, [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]] was appointed commander of the local division at Semarang, where he and Lim rekindled their friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]] valued reliability, and Lim consistently delivered, even at a personal loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Over time, Lim became [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]]'s go-to person for all money matters, and as [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]] rose through the military ranks, he became Lim's patron and protector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]]'s Rise to Power
The late 1950s saw economic weakness and political turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Sukarno's anti-imperialist ideologies brought him closer to the Communists, but his focus on revolution neglected the economy, leading to hyperinflation after the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. He steadily lost power, culminating in the chaos of 1965-1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

On September 30, 1965, an attempted coup led to the kidnapping and killing of seven senior military officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The coup, controversially attributed to the Communists, failed, and [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]], who was not targeted, led a Western-backed counter-coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This devolved into mass killings of hundreds of thousands of suspected Communists, ethnic Chinese, and other leftists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. In March 1966, Sukarno transferred power to [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]], who declared a "New Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This marked a significant shift in Indonesia's internal and external policies, terminating war with Malaysia, dissolving alliances with communist China, and rejoining the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## The New Order and [[crony_capitalism_in_indonesia | Crony Capitalism]]
Under [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]], Indonesia sought to reform its economy, which suffered from hyperinflation and insufficient revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The country, rich in natural resources and with a large, cheap labor force, rebuilt its tax base and opened up to foreign capital and aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This development plan led to consistent economic growth throughout [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]]'s reign, but also created new opportunities for corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

Even before [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]], the military and business community were closely intertwined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. In the 1950s, military commanders partnered with local businessmen, known as *kukong* (Hokkian for "Boss"), often ethnic Chinese, to raise funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. These businessmen received favors and concessions in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. After independence, the military became involved in daily services, from shipping to hotels and timber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This system strengthened under [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]], who crafted a [[crony_capitalism_in_indonesia | crony capitalist]] political pyramid that collected rents on a broad range of economic activities, flowing upwards to himself and his elite circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]]'s Chinese business partners relied on him for protection, as the government carefully separated economic and political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Lim, initially one of [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]]'s Chinese *kukong*, quickly rose to become the biggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Key Business Ventures

### Cloves
In 1966, the government granted Lim one of two exclusive licenses to import cloves from Africa, a critical ingredient for Indonesia's *kretek* cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Though the license granted Lim only a small percentage of profits, with the majority going to a slush fund owned by the president, it provided critical early funds for Lim to expand into more lucrative businesses like food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

### Flour Milling (Bogasari)
Indonesia was introduced to wheat through U.S. food aid in 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. In the late 1960s, Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok suggested Lim open flour mills in Indonesia, as wheat had to be milled in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The two partnered covertly, founding Bogasari Flour Mills in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Bogasari quickly received a monopoly on the import, milling, and distribution of wheat for Western Indonesia, covering 80% of the country's population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Flour milling became immensely profitable (25-35% profit margins), growing rapidly as Indonesians embraced wheat products like instant noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. 26% of Bogasari's profits were designated to foundations headed by [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]] and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### Indofood
The Salim Group's food business expanded to create Indofood, a sprawling $7 billion conglomerate producing instant noodles, biscuits, milk, and chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Indofood became one of the world's biggest instant noodle producers, controlling 90% of the Indonesian market throughout the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

### Cement (Indocement)
Salim also competently executed on the government's development plans, such as entering the cement industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]] directed Lim to enter the industry with the help of Taiwan's Tuntex Group after declining an American company's offer for a monopoly license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Lim built a massive cement complex near Jakarta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Indonesia's oil export boom in the 1970s fueled demand for new construction, allowing Lim to build one of the world's biggest cement companies, eventually controlling 60% of Indonesia's total cement production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. When oil prices tumbled in 1984, Lim turned to [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]] for a bailout, and the government purchased 35% of what is now PT Indocement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

## Expansion and Diversification
By the end of the 1970s, the Salim Group grew from three companies in 1957 to about 54 companies across six fields: trading, automobile manufacturing, property and construction, finance, and natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Starting in the mid-1980s, the company exploded, with over 225 Lim-affiliated businesses by 1986, generating nearly a billion dollars in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Another estimate in 1989 counted 350 affiliated companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Many of these companies were monopolies or near-monopolies, such as Indomobile Group (car manufacturing) and Indomaret (convenience store chain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. The group's structure was a "messy network" of private and public companies, often separate entities for tax reasons, connected only by Lim, his family, and his business partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Bank Central Asia (BCA)
One of the Salim Group's biggest and most valuable businesses was its bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Lim had purchased a small knitting company with a banking license in Semarang in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. He renamed it Bank Central Asia (BCA) and moved it to Jakarta, distributing some shares to [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]]'s generals and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. BCA remained small until 1975, when Lim recruited banking wunderkind Mochtar Riady, making him its single biggest shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Riady had previously built Panin Bank into Indonesia's largest private bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

To grow BCA, Riady targeted customers from Lim's empire (e.g., flour, cement businesses) and overhauled the bank's systems, computerizing and linking branches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. BCA was one of the first Indonesian banks to issue credit cards, cross-sell financial products, and install hundreds of ATMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. In just three years, Riady transformed BCA into Indonesia's biggest private bank, with deposits soaring from 1 billion Indonesian Rupiah in 1974 to 7.5 trillion Rupiah in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Riady eventually transitioned out of BCA after 15 years to focus on his family-owned business, Lippo Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Lippo Group is now one of Indonesia's biggest conglomerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. BCA continued to grow, but banking reforms in 1989 that made it easier to start new banks led to significant competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

## [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]]'s Declining Influence and Lim's Diversification
By the 1990s, [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]] was starting to get out of touch, and his children's incompetence and self-interest began to turn public opinion against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. An infamous example was [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]]'s 1990 creation of a single clove monopoly for his youngest son, Tommy, who ran the industry into the ground, necessitating a $350 million bailout from Bank Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

Sensing a change in the political winds, Lim and his family began diversifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. In 1981, he founded First Pacific, a small financial services company in Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. From the mid-1980s, Lim began building real estate and consumer businesses in Hong Kong, China, and Singapore through First Pacific, strategically reducing reliance on his political relationships with [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

Indonesia's oil export boom ended in 1985, leading to reforms to ease imports and exports, including cutting red tape and lowering tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. While initially successful, non-oil exports sputtered by 1994, with foreign direct investments declining, largely due to investors pivoting to a rapidly opening China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:19:01]</a>. The Indonesian government responded with further reforms, removing limits on foreign investment and opening new sectors, though protecting those dominated by [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]]'s children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. This seemed to work, with GDP growth rebounding to about 8% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

The Salim Group experienced some of its greatest expansions during this period, with investments, partnerships, and acquisitions across Asia, growing at 40-50% a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. Foreign newspapers estimated the empire's total revenues at $9-11 billion by 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>, while independent analysts estimated 1996 revenues at $22.8 billion, constituting 4% of Indonesia's total GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. In 1997, Lim's net worth reached $4 billion, making him the world's 68th richest man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

## The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and [[collapse_of_daewoo_group | Salim Group's Collapse]]

Beneath the surface, Indonesia's economic boom was fueled by short-term external debts, doubling from $70 billion in 1990 to $140 billion by mid-1997, mostly borrowed by the private sector and invested in domestic ventures like construction and real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

On July 2, 1997, Thailand free-floated its currency, starting a contagion across Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. Bank Indonesia soon lacked reserves to defend the currency, loosening the rupiah's trading band in July and floating it in August, causing it to lose over 30% of its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. This devaluation severely impacted Indonesian banks, whose foreign-denominated debt grew, with $20 billion due within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. Intense competition from 1990s banking reforms combined with high non-performing loans led to many small banks becoming insolvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

In October 1997, 16 commercial banks closed, leading to bank runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. Rumors spread that Lim had died and BCA's Singapore branches closed (BCA had no Singapore branch) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. Despite a public appearance by Lim, a run on BCA cost $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. The IMF intervened with a $33 billion bailout package in October 1997, with stringent economic reform conditions including disassembling state and private monopolies, cutting subsidies, and further opening up the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.

Indonesia's economy grew 4.6% in 1997, but contracted by 13% in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. Construction shrank by 37%, financial sector by 26.6%, and manufacturing by 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. Millions lost jobs, and food and living costs skyrocketed due to the weak currency and an El Nino drought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. IMF reforms attacked monopolies in various sectors, many dominated by [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]]'s cronies and family, hitting his supporters when he needed them most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]] chafed at these conditions, leading to deteriorating relations with the IMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

In May 1998, mass riots erupted after fuel subsidy cuts, targeting ethnic Chinese and their businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. A massive pro-democracy student demonstration demanded [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]]'s resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. With his cabinet abandoning him, [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]] resigned on May 21, 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

### Aftermath for Salim Group
Lim was out of the country during the riots, having mostly relocated to Singapore, but his home was attacked and set on fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. His son and financial heir, Anthony Salim, evacuated the country, paying bribes to pass roadblocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. BCA and other Salim companies suffered fire damage, but the real damage came from the bank's association with a government crony, leading to a "titanic run" on BCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. BCA collapsed, forcing the central bank to take it over along with its $5 billion in debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

With a new political environment, the massive and largely insolvent Salim Empire began to break apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. Many of BCA's debts were to other Salim Group companies, threatening them all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>. Despite popular fury, Anthony Salim, a fierce negotiator, settled with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. The Salim Group handed over its stakes in over 100 Indonesian businesses, including Indocement and Indomobile, to repay the $5 billion bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. Crucially, Salim managed to retain a 50.1% share in Indofood, using complex transactions to move those holdings offshore to the family's First Pacific financial company in Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. This proved to be a savvy move, as Indofood has since become one of the world's biggest food companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.

## Legacy
Lim never returned to Indonesia after 1998, dying peacefully in Singapore in 2012 at the age of 95 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. His estimated net worth at the time was $655 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. Lim was the right person who made the right friends at the right time, and while [[suhartos_relationship_with_the_business_elite | Suharto]]'s governance brought substantial economic benefits to the country (7% annual economic growth and development of agricultural and manufacturing bases), it also greatly enriched himself, his cronies, and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.

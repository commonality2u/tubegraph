The semiconductor manufacturing industry faces significant challenges related to water usage, particularly given current global climate trends and the increasing complexity of chip fabrication processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Regions like Tainan, Gaochun, Taitung, and Hsinchu in Taiwan have experienced severe droughts, impacting local industries, including major semiconductor manufacturers like TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Reports indicate TSMC has budgeted millions of dollars to truck water to its fabs in Tainan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## High Water Demand in Semiconductor Manufacturing

While residential water saving is important, water usage in agricultural and industrial sectors far exceeds household consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. [[Impact of semiconductor industry on local water resources | Semiconductor manufacturing]] is particularly water-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### The Role of Ultra-Pure Water (UPW)

A large portion of water is used for washing [[silicon_wafer_manufacturing_process_and_challenges | wafers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Approximately 30% to 40% of modern wafer fabrication steps involve some form of cleaning, such as "wet cleaning," where sequential wash steps remove organics, metals, and particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. After each washing step, water is used to rinse off chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Semiconductor companies cannot use regular tap water due to particles that could damage the wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Instead, they require ultra-pure water (UPW), an industry term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. While UPW is used in other applications like nuclear energy and chemical manufacturing, the cleanliness standards in the semiconductor industry are exceptionally strict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The goal is to remove "killer particles"â€”those large enough to affect a chip's nano-architecture, including microorganisms, organic particles, dissolved metals, and gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Producing UPW is a complex process involving over a dozen steps, many of which are repeated in loops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. It takes about 6,000 liters (1,600 gallons) of city water to produce 3,800 liters (1,000 gallons) of UPW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. A single 200-millimeter (8-inch) wafer can consume over 5,600 liters (2,000 gallons) of UPW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Impact of Circuit Complexity on Water Use

The type of circuits manufactured significantly affects water usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Wafers are built in layers, and each layer requires washing before the next can be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Logic circuits, such as microprocessors, are more complex and have more layers than other semiconductors like memory ICs, display panels, or solar panels, thus requiring more water and energy for their manufacture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Increasing Demand with Advanced Nodes

In 2020, TSMC reported that it failed to meet its water consumption goals set years prior, achieving only a 5% reduction in liters of water consumed per 8-inch wafer equivalent layer, falling short of its 27% target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This shortfall was attributed to increased demands for process cleanliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. More advanced process nodes tend to be "thirstier," requiring more layers to wash, more UPW, and more stringent standards for that water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. With each new process node, the size threshold for a "killer particle" shrinks, making it harder to remove contaminants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Consequently, today's cutting-edge chips consume more water than those from a decade ago, despite advancements in water reuse and conservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This trend is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Wastewater Generation and Treatment

Semiconductor manufacturing processes generate substantial amounts of wastewater, much of which requires treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. In 2013, TSMC's fabs in Tainan alone produced 19 million tons of wastewater, compared to the entire city's 29 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

Wastewater from wet washing contains high levels of pollutants like ammonia, phosphate, and fluoride, with studies linking exposure to these chemicals to cancer in semiconductor workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Not all wastewater is the same; some requires more expensive and extensive treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. For example, ultraviolet light for disinfection is relatively cheap, but processes like reverse electrodialysis are substantially more costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

To properly manage this, large foundries separate wastewater streams and apply specific treatments for over 25 different chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## [[Water recycling and reuse technologies in semiconductor manufacturing | Water Recycling and Reuse]]

Some treated wastewater is reusable and can be fed back into the system to generate more UPW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. However, non-reusable water is often directed to cooling towers where it evaporates, helping maintain fab temperatures. This cooling process is a significant consumer of energy and water after direct manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:06:01]</a>.

Implementing such a system is complex and expensive. Smaller companies often find it more cost-effective to broadly treat aggregated water and return it to the city once it meets health and safety requirements, then draw new raw water from the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

Large fabs like TSMC, Samsung, and Intel *must* implement [[water_recycling_and_reuse_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | water reuse and recycling technologies]] due to their scale; without them, they would quickly deplete water resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. TSMC's recycle rate in 2017 was 87% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, significantly higher than the average semiconductor fab's 42% found in a Singapore study from the same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Case Study: Taiwan

In 2019, TSMC's fabs in Tainan alone consumed 50,000 metric tons (50 million liters) of water daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Sourcing this raw water is a challenge, as the area draws from the Nan Hua and Zheng One reservoirs, which frequently face low capacity, especially during droughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Taiwan's south is also its agricultural heart, adding to the competition for water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

To mitigate water stress, TSMC optimizes its water draw and usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Besides extensive recycling, the company has built large rain collection systems, capturing rainwater in 700-ton tanks for landscaping or sewer discharge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Additionally, TSMC has signed tenders to construct water reclamation plants near its fabs, which will recycle industrial wastewater using advanced methods like reverse osmosis, hollow fiber ultrafiltration, and sand filtration, similar to Singapore's "New Water" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Case Study: Arizona

The decision to build fabs in Arizona, much of which is desert, seems counterintuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Currently, 40% of Arizona's water demand is met by non-renewable groundwater, 57% by the Colorado River and other surface sources, and the remainder by reclaimed water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. When surface water sources fall short, groundwater is pumped, which is unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Arizona's government has managed water usage by transferring allocations from farms to cities, as agriculture consumes nearly 90% of total water demand in the American Southwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Converting farmland to urban areas has helped curb overall water usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

There are two primary economic reasons for placing semiconductor fabs in Arizona:
1.  **Economic Value**: High-volume semiconductor manufacturing is a highly profitable and value-added industry, making states willing to bear the costs of water infrastructure or reallocate existing water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. A 2012 study on Chandler, Arizona, found that the economic benefits from semiconductor manufacturing far outweigh the costs of providing water, generating more revenue per acre through property taxation than other land usages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
2.  **Advanced Recycling Capabilities**: The semiconductor industry is affluent enough to invest heavily in [[water_recycling_and_reuse_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | water saving, reusing, and recycling techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This means a theoretically high percentage of water can be returned to the wastewater system, significantly higher than with other land usages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Other advantages Arizona offers, such as educated talent, tax incentives, and seismic stability, outweigh the lack of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Policy Implications

The high value and profitability of semiconductor manufacturing incentivize governments to secure water for it, often by reallocating water from other sectors, primarily agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. This has been observed in both Taiwan and Arizona, where farmers face water allocation cuts diverted to tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

Agriculture is the leading consumer of water globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. There is an argument that much of current agricultural practice is not an economically efficient use of precious water, especially if sourced from groundwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. However, diverting water from farmers carries political consequences, as farmers are often valuable constituents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Governments must delicately balance these competing demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

The semiconductor industry's thirst for water will persist as Moore's Law continues to drive advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Therefore, continued innovation in water recycling, reduction, and reuse technologies is crucial to ensure sufficient water resources for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

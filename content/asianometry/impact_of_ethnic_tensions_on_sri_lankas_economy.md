Sri Lanka's [[history_of_sri_lankas_economic_development | economic development]] has been extensively studied for decades, with recent events adding a "bitter new page" to its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. This article explores the roots and causes of the ongoing economic crisis, focusing on the role of ethnic tensions.

## Early Optimism Post-Independence
Upon gaining independence from the British in 1948, Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) had several advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. It possessed a strategic trading port location and had no infrastructure damage from World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>. The country also ranked well in education and population health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, and functioned as a democracy with universal suffrage, seen as a model for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

Sri Lanka inherited a highly productive export economy, specializing in tea, rubber, and coconuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. In 1950, its GNP (adjusted for purchasing power parity) was higher than India, Pakistan, Thailand, and even South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. By 1960, its per capita gross income was $141, significantly higher than Thailand's $96 and Indonesia's $50, and comparable to South Korea's $156 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. An advisor in the late 1950s noted that the country's main challenge would be maintaining high living standards for a growing population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

## Growing Ethnic Divisions and Economic Policy Shifts
Despite this promising start, Sri Lanka was a multi-ethnic nation dominated by the Sinhalese (majority Buddhists, speaking Sinhala) and the Tamils (practicing Hinduism, speaking Tamil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. The Sinhalese constitute about 75% of the population, residing in the southwest and north central provinces, while Tamils, about 13%, live in the northern and eastern provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. Historically, relations have been tense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

The 1948 constitution, primarily based on discussions between Sinhalese elites and colonial administrators, failed to address the concerns of ethnic minorities, especially Tamils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Their objections were disregarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

After the Korean War ended in 1953, commodity export revenues crashed, forcing the government to raise rice prices and other public service costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. This led to widespread protests known as the Hartal, which forced the Prime Minister's resignation and the ruling UNP party's electoral defeat in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

The new government elected in 1956 marked a decline in Sinhalese-Tamil relations, as ethnic harmony was not a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. Political parties abandoned their multi-ethnic stances, and Sinhala was instituted as the country's only official language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

Economically, the government imposed import restrictions on consumer goods to conserve foreign currency and established state monopolies to fulfill domestic demands through [[policies_causing_economic_inefficiencies_in_sri_lanka | import substitution policies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. These policies, while sometimes successful in other Asian economies (like Taiwan and South Korea in specific industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>), often failed when implemented broadly without proper reforms, leading to inefficiencies and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. In Sri Lanka, they resulted in more expensive domestic products and a shift in import demand from finished goods to raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

By the 1970s, Sri Lanka had become one of the most closed non-communist economies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. Economic growth slowed dramatically, and the country fell behind its peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. By 1977, Sri Lankan per capita income was only $200, a mere $60 increase from 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. In contrast, South Korea's per capita income was $820, Malaysia's $930, Thailand's $420, and Indonesia's $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

The nationalization threats (and later actual nationalization in the 1970s) to the British-owned plantation economy caused it to decline due to a lack of foreign investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. The government became the country's employer of last resort, doubling its GDP share from 1961 and providing over 50% of manufacturing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. This public sector employment and other policies favored Sinhalese elites, creating an unequal scenario that fostered radical ideologies among minority Tamil youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

## Civil War and its Economic Impact
The stalled economic growth eventually built political will for change, leading to a new government in 1977 that attempted reforms and economic opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. This regime sought to attract foreign investors and establish a labor-intensive export development economy, setting up free trade zones, guaranteeing against nationalization, devaluing the currency, and limiting state participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.

However, the 1977 election also brought Tamils into power on a platform advocating an independent Tamil state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. The government's liberalization policies, while boosting growth (from 2.9% before 1977 to 6% from 1977-1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>), were not properly calibrated, hitting the poorest hardest with inflation, removal of food subsidies, and lifting of trade protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

The government's authoritarian tendencies and heavy-handed tactics against Tamil protests ignited a cycle of violence and retaliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>. Tamil militant wings consolidated into the LTTE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. In July 1983, an LTTE attack triggered "Black July," a brutal anti-Tamil pogrom across much of the country, plunging Sri Lanka into chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.

Supported by donations from the Tamil diaspora, the LTTE established a de facto state in the northern and eastern provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. The brutal civil war, despite pauses, finally ended in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

Despite the civil war, the government continued its economic opening, aiming to build a labor-intensive export industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. Manufacturing gained prominence, ending the country's historical reliance on its plantation agricultural sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. However, the war deterred some foreign investment; Motorola and Harris Corporation, which came in the early 1980s to build an assembly plant, departed for Malaysia due to political instability, representing a significant loss for Sri Lanka's potential electronics industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.

## Post-War Economic Challenges
The end of the civil war in 2009 under Mahinda Rajapaksa's government brought peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>, allowing him to consolidate power and expand executive authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. Following the war, Sri Lanka experienced significant GDP growth (7% a year), a booming stock market, and reductions in poverty and unemployment by 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. By 2019, it was an upper-middle-income country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.

However, this boom was not sustainable. 70% of real GDP increase from 2004-2013 came from [[sri_lankas_shift_from_manufacturing_to_debt_funded_infrastructure | debt-fueled major public sector construction and infrastructure]] rather than labor-intensive manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. These mega-projects, like the Colombo Port City, were often in areas close to the government's political power base rather than the war-torn north and east <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>, and showed signs of corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>.

Manufacturing's share of GDP declined after the early 2000s, and growth in manufacturing focused on domestic needs (food, beverage, tobacco) rather than export-oriented industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>. The [[sri_lankas_shift_from_manufacturing_to_debt_funded_infrastructure | shift from manufacturing to debt-funded infrastructure]], supported by remittances from migrant workers, reduced the economy's resilience to external shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. This lack of resilience, combined with the [[effect_of_the_pandemic_on_sri_lankas_economic_crisis | effect of the pandemic on Sri Lanka's economic crisis]], significantly impacted key foreign exchange earners like exports, remittances, and tourism, leading to the current crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>. The economic hardship, while acutely felt during the pandemic, was a "long time coming," with the country "on the brink for a very long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>.

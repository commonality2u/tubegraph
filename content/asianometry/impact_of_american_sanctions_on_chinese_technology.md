In late August 2023, Huawei quietly began selling its own phone chips again, with the release of the Huawei Mate 60 Pro featuring the Kirin 9000s, a 7-nanometer class chip, likely manufactured by SMIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This development has sparked significant discussion, particularly concerning the [[impact_of_export_bans_and_political_influence_on_chinese_semiconductor_industry | impact of American sanctions]] on Chinese technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## The Kirin 9000s Chip

The Kirin 9000s is a 107 square millimeter die, about 2% larger than Huawei's previous leading-edge chips, the Kirin 9000 and 9000E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. The earlier Kirin 9000 was briefly produced using TSMC's 5-nanometer process until American sanctions ended that collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The new 7-nanometer class chip is approximately 5-6 years behind the industry's leading edge, as TSMC began shipping 3-nanometer class chips in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

Teardowns and speed tests suggest the Kirin 9000s supports 5G connectivity, though Huawei appears to be concealing this functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. The SoC's CPU core is a customization of Arm IP, and its GPU is a new custom design by Huawei or HiSilicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. Initial yields for SMIC's N+2 node are expected to be higher than anticipated, and as Huawei sells more phones, SMIC's yields will improve, similar to how TSMC scaled its N7 yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. The 7nm chip is confirmed to be real and the node that produced it is considered "really, really good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## Why the Surprise?

The emergence of this chip should not be a surprise. Previous reports suggested the expectation of a HiSilicon chip using SMIC's 7nm N+2 process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Nikkei Asia also mentioned SMIC working with Huawei on a new 5G chip prior to its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. News of the SMIC N+2 process first surfaced in July 2022, when it was used for Bitcoin miners, which are simpler chips suitable for node improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. The successful production of a complex phone SoC like the Kirin 9000s demonstrates significant progress by SMIC Co-CEO Liang Mong-song and SMIC within about a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

## More Advanced Chips Are Coming

Further advancements are anticipated despite the [[impact_of_export_bans_on_semiconductor_technology | impact of export bans on semiconductor technology]]. Dr. Burn Lin, former TSMC R&D director, stated in January 2022 that SMIC could fabricate 5-nanometer class chips using only multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. While the United States banned EUV lithography exports, 193-nanometer immersion lithography machines remain crucial, performing 70-80% of the lithography work for leading foundries like Intel, TSMC, and Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. The US administration initially held back on a 193i ban, but the Netherlands and Japan joined the US in imposing export restrictions on June 30, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

SMIC still possesses enough of these machines to increase 7-nanometer production and move towards 5-nanometer. Despite challenges like machine breakdowns and the potential for expanded sanctions, a 5-nanometer class Huawei chip is expected within 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

## An Emerging China-Only Supply Line

The Mate 60 Pro signifies more than just an advanced chip; it is embedded within an ecosystem of domestic Chinese suppliers that have achieved feature parity with the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. Domestic suppliers provided components like the radio frequency front-end module and satellite communications modem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. With the exception of memory from SK Hynix, the entire phone is effectively a China-only ecosystem, suggesting the establishment of a complete, self-contained supply chain within the People's Republic of China for various domestic electronics, including smartphone SOCs, CPUs, and AI accelerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

## AI Is the Next Big Move

While a phone chip on par with a five-year-old release might not seem revolutionary, it represents a significant shift for companies like Qualcomm, Apple, and MediaTek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. Qualcomm's sales to Huawei, amounting to tens of millions of chips, are likely to be replaced by the new Kirin 9000s and similar domestic chips, leading to business losses for non-Chinese semiconductor makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

After fulfilling Huawei orders, SMIC is expected to seek new N+2 node customers in high-powered computing, aiming to produce a domestic AI accelerator (a Chinese version of Nvidia A100 or TPU) within 1-2 years, potentially designed by companies like Biren, Baidu, Alibaba Cloud, or Tencent, "unless sanctions intervene" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

## What China Does Next

China's goal is to widely distribute the Mate 60 Pro to scale production, improve yields, and fund further development, potentially targeting markets in Europe, Australia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. Each export sale not only reduces market share for Western phone makers but also strengthens SMIC's production capabilities and profitability, accelerating its move to 5 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

SMIC should also prioritize replicating advanced packaging technologies, such as chiplets and 2.5D die-stacking, crucial for advanced AI applications requiring high data bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>. Furthermore, the Chinese Government needs to bolster its domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment ecosystem to replace foreign suppliers like ASML, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, and Lam Research, as foreign equipment may pose security risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.

## What America Does Next

Jordan Schneider of ChinaTalk explains that the October 7th restrictions by the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security aimed to cut off foreign support for "advanced semiconductors," defined as logic ICs at 16/14nm or below, due to their implications for military modernization and human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. The US intelligence suggests that China's ability to manufacture advanced logic chips significantly impacts the regional military balance of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>.

Given SMIC and Huawei's progress, if the US government views a Chinese 7-nanometer node as a national security threat, it may intensify efforts to stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. This requires a better understanding of foreign semiconductor manufacturing equipment still reaching China, as domestic suppliers remain years behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. Equipment companies like Applied, Lam Research, Tokyo Electron, and KLA can still sell most of their tools, ostensibly for lagging-edge nodes, but these tools are likely repurposed for advanced chips like the Kirin 9000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

To prevent China from developing leading-edge capacity at scale, the US, in cooperation with allies like Japan, the Netherlands, and Germany, should consider "tighter export controls" targeting tools currently being repurposed, such as Argon Fluoride Immersion lithography, mask, and CMP equipment, and implement "far less liberal use of licenses" for firms like SMIC on the entity list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Kirin 9000s represents a significant milestone in technology history, akin to Samsung's achievement in 1986 when it rapidly closed the semiconductor gap with Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. The People's Republic of China is adopting a "Korean approach" to semiconductor manufacturing, which has proven effective for South Korea and appears to be working for China, despite and perhaps in response to, the [[impact_of_geopolitical_tensions_on_semiconductor_industry | impact of geopolitical tensions on semiconductor industry]] and sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>.

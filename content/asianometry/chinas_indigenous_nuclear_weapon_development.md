On October 16, 1964, at 3:00 PM, the People's Republic of China (PRC) detonated its first domestically produced atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This event marked China's entry as one of the five Atomic Powers, joining the United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It took China less than five years to produce a working nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Motivations and Early Quest for Security

Initially, when the United States held the sole atomic bomb, Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party leadership feared possible American nuclear intervention in the Chinese Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. In December 1949, during a visit to Stalin to negotiate China's entry into the Soviet Bloc, Mao sought the assurance of a nuclear umbrella over his "precarious country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The Soviets, having recently broken the Western monopoly, were reluctant to explicitly grant such protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

The original text of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance stated that in the event of an invasion of one signatory country by a third, the other would "render assistance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Zhou Enlai suggested adding the clause "with all means at its disposal," which, after initial Soviet resistance, was accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. However, nothing about nuclear weapons was formally written down, leaving the meaning open to interpretation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### The Korean War and Nuclear Blackmail

These clauses were tested during the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. As American forces approached the Yalu River, the border between North Korea and China, the Chinese worried about a potential American invasion of communist China and the use of the atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Chinese leadership decided to intervene, betting on their manpower advantage and believing the Americans would not risk all-out nuclear warfare with the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Mao's gamble paid off; the Americans did not use nuclear weapons, though they threatened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

After the war, the Americans continued to use the nuclear weapons issue as leverage over China, which the Chinese leadership called "nuclear blackmail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Examples included comments from Secretary of State John Foster Dulles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a> and General Curtis LeMay, who suggested dropping bombs in China, Manchuria, and Southeastern Russia in 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

During the First Taiwan Strait Crisis in late 1954 and 1955, U.S. military leadership recommended using nuclear weapons, although President Eisenhower ultimately refrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. In December 1954, the United States and the Republic of China (Taiwan) signed a mutual defense treaty, which the Communists believed would embolden the Kuomintang (Gomidan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

While Mao and the Communist Party likely would have pursued an atomic weapon regardless, these crises gave the process "special urgency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Soviet Assistance and the Sino-Soviet Split

China's first impulse was to seek assistance from its new ally, the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The Soviet Union was China's largest external trading partner, providing loans, helping develop Soviet-style industrial projects, and supplying the PLA with military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

The PRC had long known about the [[soviet_assistance_in_chinas_nuclear_program | Soviet nuclear program]]. In 1949, a Communist Party delegation led by Liu Shaoqi asked Stalin to tour nuclear installations, but Stalin instead showed them a nuclear testing documentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. While alive, Stalin never transferred atomic technology beyond the implicit "protection of their nuclear umbrella" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Khrushchev's Change of Stance

After Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev became the Soviet leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Khrushchev sought Chinese support to boost his domestic influence and de-Stalinization efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In October 1954, Mao asked Khrushchev to assist China in its nuclear weapons program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Khrushchev was surprised and initially tried to dissuade China, urging them to focus on economic development, reiterating the nuclear umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. However, the Chinese insisted, and the Soviets agreed to cooperate on certain items for peaceful atomic energy use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

In April 1955, the Sino-Soviet Atomic Cooperation Treaty was signed. The Soviets agreed to provide an experimental nuclear power plant and a cyclotron, costing 430 million rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. They sent nuclear experts, gave lectures to 1,400 Chinese scientists, and helped explore China's uranium reserves in Xinjiang, with any surplus uranium to be exported to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. In February 1956, Khrushchev expanded cooperation to include sending more Chinese students to the Soviet Union and helping build nuclear research facilities in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### The Turning Point and the Prototype Bomb

Despite this cooperation, Mao and his colleagues viewed the alliance as one of convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Up until 1957, Soviet transfers primarily focused on peaceful atomic energy, though China already possessed significant knowledge in reactor design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. However, nuclear weapons required special techniques and infrastructure, which the Soviets resisted sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

In late October 1956, a series of anti-communist protests in Hungary and Poland led to violent Soviet repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Weakened, the Soviets needed their primary foreign ally's backing, which came at a price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. In 1957, against military advice, Khrushchev decided to transfer atomic bomb technology to the Chinese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

In October 1957, China and the Soviets signed an agreement for the "production of new weapons and Military technology equipment and establishment of a comprehensive atomic energy industry in China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This included a "teaching model atomic bomb complete with designs and documentation," as well as technology for casings, processing uranium and plutonium, and testing guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

However, the actual helpfulness of these transfers for the nuclear weapons program is debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Khrushchev claimed they shared "almost everything" and "kept no secrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Yet, Soviet scientists were told to limit themselves, and Chinese impressions of the nuclear weapon design information were not positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. A Soviet lecture in July 1958 on nuclear weapon theory provided only a basic sketch on a blackboard, no parameters or formulas, and notes were not allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. The Chinese later claimed the data was "completely wrong" and misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Dr. Chen Sun Chang, familiar with nuclear weapon concepts from his time in the United States, noted that the information was similar to what could be obtained from "other capitalist countries" with "a few more details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The subsequent Sino-Soviet split complicates the assessment of mutual contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

Regardless, the scale of technology transferred, even for peaceful atomic energy and raw materials, was massive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. The two countries collaborated on prospecting and mining efforts for China's uranium mines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, although China claimed Soviet aid here was not particularly helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. The Soviets also provided advanced missiles, including the R-12 intercontinental ballistic missile, which the Chinese received for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

### The Sino-Soviet Split and Aid Withdrawal

Issues emerged as early as 1956 with Khrushchev's secret speech criticizing Stalin, which infuriated Mao <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. In November 1957, Mao's comments at the Moscow Conference, suggesting that half of mankind dying in a nuclear war would lead to global socialism, dismayed Khrushchev and the Soviet leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

Due to these events, the Soviets decided to renege on the teaching bomb prototype promised in the October 1957 agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Delays and security concerns were cited, and the transfer was postponed indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. The Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958, where Mao initiated shelling of the Jinmen and Matsu islands, further threatened nuclear war and solidified Khrushchev's realization of his "horrible mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

In June 1959, Khrushchev informed China of the termination of military cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Most Soviet military advisors left within a month, with the last advisor departing in July 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Ultimately, 40% of the promised equipment and raw materials never arrived, and only a minority of the 30 Sino-Soviet nuclear industry projects were completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

## Indigenous Development Post-Split

The withdrawal of Soviet advisors was a blow, but not entirely unexpected, as PLA leaders had suspected the Soviets aimed to maintain a technical gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. In January 1960, China launched the "596 project," named to commemorate the "shameful date" of Soviet aid withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. Zhou Enlai declared that China would achieve a breakthrough in three years, master know-how in five, and have a stockpile in eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

Engulfed in the economic and social pressures of the Great Leap Forward, China abandoned its dual-track approach (uranium-235 and plutonium) and focused solely on the uranium-235 design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

### Uranium Enrichment and Bomb Design

A 1950s-style nuclear bomb relies on mashing fissile material into super-criticality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. For uranium-235, this required a gaseous diffusion plant to separate U-235 from U-238 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. China's gaseous diffusion plant was located in Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, spotted by U.S. aerial reconnaissance as early as August 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

The last Soviet advisors left the Lanzhou facility in July 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Plant leader Wong Jeff, who personally escorted the last advisors, pushed technicians to manage the tens of thousands of raw materials and supplies for the U-235 production line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Despite the remote location, the Great Leap Forward fervor led to technicians disassembling Soviet electrical equipment in the name of "technological innovation," which required a direct appeal to Mao Zedong to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Food shortages hit the staff in 1960, but progress continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. By late 1961, the Lanzhou plant's machinery was successfully installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The Chinese found substitutes for Soviet components, including a special lubricant for gaseous diffusion pumps that advisors had taken with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. By mid-1963, Lanzhou scientists were isolating uranium-235 in mass, and by January 1964, 90% enrichment was achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

For bomb design, China chose an implosion design, similar to the Nagasaki bomb, which required less fissile material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. Instead of plutonium, they used uranium-235 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. The key challenge was synchronizing high explosives to initiate the nuclear chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. Though lacking direct access to Los Alamos like the British, the Chinese knew a bomb was possible and understood the theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. By the time the Soviets left in 1960, China had completed theoretical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>, aided by some "sloppy shredding" of critical papers by the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. Working in Beijing suburbs with hand calculators, the team mastered implosion theory by late 1962 and finalized their implosion mechanism design a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. In late 1963, enriched uranium arrived at the nuclear component manufacturing plant in Subei, Gansu Province, where it was machined into a highly enriched uranium ball and packaged into the "596 bomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

## Impact and Cost

The successful nuclear test caught both the Americans and Soviets off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. The U.S. government knew about China's program by 1959 and considered intervention, with President Kennedy expressing concern about Southeast Asia falling to Communists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. Kennedy even put out feelers to Khrushchev about military intervention, but Khrushchev never pursued the idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. China's choice of an implosion bomb using uranium, rather than plutonium, confused American spymasters, who underestimated the size of the Lanzhou gaseous diffusion plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>.

China's indigenous nuclear bomb program was one of its largest undertakings, involving hundreds of thousands of people across over 900 factories, research institutes, and schools in 20 provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. This staggering cost for an undeveloped nation, estimated at 10.7 billion RMB or $4.1 billion in 1957 prices, occurred during the economically difficult years of the Great Leap Forward and early 1960s, forcing cuts in other government projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

The extent of the benefit from Soviet technology transfer remains debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. Deng Xiaoping reportedly stated in 1966 that China would not have built the bombs so fast if the Soviets hadn't broken the treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. While the Soviets provided significant aid, their withdrawal spurred China's will to finish the job independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.

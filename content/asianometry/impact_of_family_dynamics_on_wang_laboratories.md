From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The trajectory of [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Laboratories]] was profoundly shaped by the family dynamics of its founder, [[An_Wangs_journey_from_China_to_success_in_America | An Wang]], particularly his strong desire for family control and the eventual succession plan involving his son, Fred Wang.

## [[An_Wangs_journey_from_China_to_success_in_America | An Wang]]'s Vision and Control
[[An_Wangs_journey_from_China_to_success_in_America | An Wang]], an "incredible engineer" and "brilliant businessman," founded [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Laboratories]] in 1951 with just $600 in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. His wife, Lorraine Chu, encouraged him to apply for his magnetic core memory patent, a concept that Harvard did not reserve patent rights for at the time, outside of public health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Despite facing racism, challenges with English, and a lack of money, Wang possessed "unshakable confidence" in his abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This confidence extended to naming the company after himself, never entertaining the notion of changing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. He famously retorted to an official suggesting a more "American" name, "If you don't like name of company you go work for company you like name better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

Wang was a micromanager who "obsessed over every little thing in his company," even reviewing all mail received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. His involvement was so deep that "When I say Wong am I talking about the company or the person it doesn't matter the two are one and one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Critically, he "envisioning eventually passing it over to his son" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## The Succession Plan: Fred Wang
[[An_Wangs_journey_from_China_to_success_in_America | An Wang]] and his wife, Lorraine Chu, had three children: Fred, Courtney, and Juliet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Fred Wang shared some similarities with his father, being "a bit shy, good at math and sciences but not so much the other stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. However, unlike his immigrant father, Fred "grew up immersed in wealth and privilege" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. Both parents were "strong-willed, traditional Asian style parents," with his mother particularly pushing him to attend Harvard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

After graduating from Brown (a "perfectly fine school which his mother could not accept"), Fred was unsure of his career path, eventually defaulting to a low-level programmer role at the family business for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. He then moved into marketing before being pulled to shadow his father as a "glorified gopher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. In 1978, at 28, Fred was informed by his father of the plan for him and later his brother Courtney to take over [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Labs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. In 1980, [[An_Wangs_journey_from_China_to_success_in_America | An Wang]] placed Fred in charge of the critical R&D department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.

## Impact on [[challenges_and_decline_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Lab's Decline]]
Fred, despite being "smart and decent," lacked his father's unique touch in managing R&D operations and powerful egos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. His elevation into the company's leadership alongside [[An_Wangs_journey_from_China_to_success_in_America | An Wang]] and then-president John Cunningham, "turned out to be a disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

In October 1983, Fred's desire to "show that he could develop products like his father" led to the rushed announcement of 14 new products, including the Wang Professional Image Computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. These products, however, were "very late and in some cases years late," severely damaging Fred's credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. This period coincided with the rise of the IBM PC, which "took the world by storm" and began eroding [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang's]] market share in word processors and 2200 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. [[An_Wangs_journey_from_China_to_success_in_America | An Wang]] resisted the PC revolution, seeing it as a "future dead end commodity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. When Fred pushed for [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang's]] own PC, it lacked compatibility with IBM's software ecosystem, leading to its "Dead on Arrival" status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

In October 1984, after the "disastrous product announcement," [[An_Wangs_journey_from_China_to_success_in_America | An Wang]] moved Fred to run manufacturing, overruling John Cunningham's arguments against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. The R&D department continued to produce "Duds," and the company recklessly expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. [[An_Wangs_journey_from_China_to_success_in_America | An Wang]] rejected potential mergers that could have shored up debt, specifically because they "potentially would have taken control away from the Wong family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

> "For a very long time Dr Wong had seen the future but now the doctor was past his Prime and his loyalty to his family was taking the company down the wrong path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

In April 1985, [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Labs]] announced a 66% quarterly profit decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. Cunningham resigned in July 1985, selling all his stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>. Although [[An_Wangs_journey_from_China_to_success_in_America | An Wang]] briefly took over, he made Fred the company president in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. The board's five requests throughout 1987 to bring in a professional manager to work with Fred were all refused by [[An_Wangs_journey_from_China_to_success_in_America | An Wang]], who famously stated, "he is my son and he can do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>.

Losses continued to grow, culminating in a $424 million annual loss in July 1989, leading to stock crash and further layoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. In August 1989, after undergoing cancer surgery, [[An_Wangs_journey_from_China_to_success_in_America | An Wang]] had to fire his own son, with turnaround expert Richard Miller appointed president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

While [[challenges_and_decline_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Lab's]] ultimate failure was complex and included missing the PC revolution and the company's failure to find the next hit product, the "turmoil overhanging the company's secession certainly did not help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. [[An_Wangs_journey_from_China_to_success_in_America | An Wang]] died on March 24, 1990, at 70, with his last request to Miller being to "try and preserve name I want it remembered has company founded by immigrant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:38">[00:28:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. Despite efforts, [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Laboratories]] went bankrupt in 1992, two years after its founder's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

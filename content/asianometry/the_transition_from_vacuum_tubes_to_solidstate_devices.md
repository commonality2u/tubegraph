The timeline for microelectronics technology begins on December 16, 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This date marks the creation of [[the_invention_and_significance_of_the_first_transistors | The First Transistor]], a discovery that fundamentally changed technology and laid the foundation for modern computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Originating from research for radios, radars, and telephones, the transistor revolutionized technology by replacing the vacuum tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Limitations of Vacuum Tubes

AT&T and Bell Labs had a long-standing desire to replace the vacuum tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Vacuum tubes, such as the triode, were initially developed for radio, TV, and telecommunications due to their ability to rectify and amplify signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. While tubes were central to AT&T's extensive telephone infrastructure, they also presented significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a single transcontinental phone call required 12,300 vacuum tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. These tubes primarily served as amplifiers to regenerate and retransmit phone signals that had weakened over copper lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. However, vacuum tubes were large, expensive, and prone to burning out, leading to poor customer experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Consequently, AT&T sought a more reliable alternative as early as the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Early Semiconductor Research at Bell Labs

William Shockley joined Bell Labs' Vacuum Tube Department in 1936, turning down offers from Yale and General Electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Pre-war research focused on copper-oxide rectifiers, which convert AC power to DC to provide a stable power supply for telephones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. A Bell Labs scientist observed the similarity between rectifiers and vacuum tubes in amplifying signals, prompting the question of whether rectifiers could function as amplifiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Bell Labs hired William Brattain to work with Joseph Becker to modify rectifiers to behave like vacuum tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. These initial experiments were unsuccessful due to a lack of proper grounding in physics and the use of impure semiconducting materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The need for far purer materials would be addressed by World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Wartime Advancements

During World War II, William Shockley served in anti-submarine research and oversaw radar system deployments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. While the United States initially lagged behind the British in solid-state physics for semiconductor technology, the immense resources America dedicated to wartime semiconductor research made a critical difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Thirty to forty laboratories were dedicated to radar research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Significant work involved very pure germanium and silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. In 1942, a team at Purdue University, led by Professor Karl Lark-Horovitz, received a U.S. Government grant to produce [[the_development_and_impact_of_the_point_contact_transistor | point contact crystal rectifiers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These devices, known as "cat's whisker" detectors, involved pressing a thin metal wire against a semiconducting material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

While useful for radar, the cat's whisker often burnt out due to impurities in the semiconducting material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This led to efforts to produce extremely pure germanium and silicon crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. A single graduate student, working with Eagle-Picher Company, successfully turned byproduct germanium into pure ingots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Before the war, silicon ingots rarely exceeded 99% purity, but after the war, American companies like DuPont achieved 99.999% purity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Bell Labs' wartime radar work also stimulated significant progress in semiconductor research and production, including silicon diodes and point contacts for radar detectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Post-War Innovation at Bell Labs

In the spring of 1945, Mervin Kelly became Bell Labs' director of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Recognizing Bell Labs' leading position in solid-state physics, Kelly created new interdisciplinary research groups, including electrical engineers, chemists, experimentalists, and theorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. William Shockley, returning from his wartime contributions, co-headed one of these groups, which included Walter Brattain and John Bardeen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

A visit to Purdue in September 1945 convinced Shockley's team that silicon and germanium were the best material candidates, with germanium preferred for its lower melting temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. In January 1946, Shockley predicted that applying a strong external electrical field to a thin layer of silicon or germanium could modulate its conductivity, potentially creating a three-terminal device similar to a vacuum tube triode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This "field effect" device would amplify a small current signal onto a larger one, creating a solid-state amplifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, or act as a switch for 1s and 0s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## The First Transistor: The Point Contact Transistor

Shockley's field effect experiments, conducted by his colleagues, initially failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Bardeen, the brilliant theorist, and Brattain, the experimentalist, worked closely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. When the observed modulation was far less than predicted, Bardeen theorized that the electrical field was being blocked at the surface of the semiconducting material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

After further probing the germanium surface with two wires and defying theoretical explanation, Bardeen suggested placing the two probes very closely together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Brattain recounts creating this setup by cementing a piece of gold foil onto a polystyrene triangle, then carefully cutting the gold in two at the apex with a razor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

The experiment was conducted on December 16, 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Brattain wiggled the triangle to make contact with both ends of the gold, successfully making one contact an emitter and the other a collector, achieving approximately 100-fold amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This deceptively simple setup resulted in their solid-state amplifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Brattain considered it the most important experiment of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, while Bardeen quietly told his wife, "We discovered something important today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

### Secrecy and Announcement

Bell Labs demonstrated the device to AT&T leadership a week later, allowing them to hear amplified speech through headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. AT&T kept the discovery secret for a few months to patent the design and ran it by the U.S. military, who considered classifying it or even undertaking an "underground" venture like the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Fortunately, the broad applications of the device prevented classification, and the news was released on June 30, 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The New York Times' initial mention of the transistor dryly noted its "applications in radio where a vacuum tube ordinarily is employed," a significant understatement of its future impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Challenges of the Point Contact Transistor

The announcement of [[the_development_and_impact_of_the_point_contact_transistor | the point contact transistor]] sparked a massive global rush into solid-state physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. While historically important, its discovery was largely accidental, and the team was seeking something entirely different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Moreover, the underlying physics of its amplification were unclear, even a decade later when Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley won their Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

Commercially, the point contact transistor failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Bell Labs' sister company, Western Electric, aimed for it to replace all vacuum tubes and produced 8,400 devices a month by 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. However, its operation relied on fragile semiconductor surface structures, making it highly susceptible to humidity and temperature, resulting in inconsistent performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

## The Junction Transistor

Uninvolved in the point contact transistor experiment, William Shockley felt frustrated and competitively driven to develop his own transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. He recognized the point contact transistor's weak commercial prospects and the undeveloped theory behind it, intensifying his theoretical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

By January 23, 1948, Shockley unified existing concepts with observations from the transistor discovery to create the junction transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Roughly, the junction transistor consists of three sections of "doped" semiconducting materials: p-type (abundance of "electron holes") and n-type (abundance of electrons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. These arrangements are either N-P-N or P-N-P, with the middle section serving as a "base" or "gate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The meeting points of these materials are called "junctions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

Shockley's critical realization was that at these junctions, majority charge carriers (electrons or electron holes) could travel across the two junctions from the emitter to the collector, penetrating the entirety of the semiconducting material rather than just the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. This concept, "minority carrier injection," was key to creating a more resilient and commercially viable device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. By manipulating the current into the base, a much larger current could be controlled, allowing for signal amplification or switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

In February 1948, before the public revelation of the first transistor, Bell Labs physicist John Shive's experimental point contact transistor results showed electron holes moving through the entire germanium, proving Shockley's minority carrier injection concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. Later, in 1950, Bell Labs chemists Gordon Teal and Morgan Sparks adopted the Czochralski process to grow long, pure germanium crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. This method, still used today for modern wafers, allowed them to alternatively dope the germanium crystal with P and N-type impurities to create P-N junctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. Bell Labs released the first "grown junction transistors" in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The junction transistor was immediately recognized as superior due to its sturdy, three-part sandwich structure, unlike the fragile point contact design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

Shockley solidified his position as the leading figure in transistor theory with his book, "Electrons and Holes in Semiconductor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. Despite tensions with Bardeen and Brattain, Shockley always acknowledged their discovery of the first transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

## Transistor Commercialization and Impact

In 1949, an antitrust lawsuit against AT&T resulted in a Consent Decree, requiring them to license their discoveries, including the transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. For $25,000, companies could purchase a patent license and receive an 800-page book and samples from Bell Labs' first symposium on transistor manufacturing in September 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

Former vacuum tube companies like RCA, General Electric, Westinghouse, and Sylvania aggressively built up germanium transistor capacity, developing new innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Around 1951 or 1952, General Electric and RCA discovered the [[development_of_silicon_transistors_for_tvs | alloy junction transistor]], which involved melting P and N-type pellets (like Indium) with germanium to create junctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. This manufacturing method was far more scalable than the grown junction transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

### First Transistorized Products and Global Adoption

By 1953, the first transistorized products entered the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. The transistorized hearing aid, costing $229 in 1953, significantly shrank the device and revolutionized the experience for the hard-of-hearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

News of the transistor spread globally, prompting countries to develop their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. [[early_innovations_in_semiconductors_by_European_scientists | France quickly developed its "transistron"]], created by scientists Welker and Matare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. Japan's Electrotechnical Laboratory produced its first point contact transistor in 1951 and its first junction transistor in 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. Sony Corporation in Japan went on to commercialize the transistor radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. Researcher Leo Esaki won the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on electron tunneling in semiconductor materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

### Impact on Computers

From the outset, transistors were expected to be integrated into computers, promising smaller, more energy-efficient, cooler, and more reliable devices than those using thousands of vacuum tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. However, scaling up reliable transistor production delayed this dream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

In November 1953, the University of Manchester launched a computer with 92 first-generation point contact transistors, generally regarded as the first transistorized computer, though it still contained some tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. Bell Labs and other companies, spurred by military demand, invested resources in more reliable transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. The commercialization of the improved alloy junction transistor and variants like Philco’s "surface-barrier transistor" quickly paved the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

In May 1954, the U.S. Air Force received the first American transistorized computer, "TRADIC," which had 700 transistors and aimed to evaluate digital navigation computers as replacements for analog ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. Within a decade, the transistor evolved from a fragile lab experiment to a device flying tens of thousands of feet in the air, marking transistorized computers as "second-generation devices" and a clear break from the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

Near the end of 1954, William Shockley decided to leave Bell Labs to start his own business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. Arnold Beckman of Beckman Instruments convinced Shockley to establish his Semiconductor Lab within Beckman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. Shockley officially resigned from Bell Labs in September 1955 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. That year, Bell Labs held 37% of all transistor patents, a figure that declined as former vacuum tube companies aggressively entered the business, ending Bell Labs' status as the sole pioneer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. Shockley's move to California marked the beginning of significant [[impact_of_generational_shifts_in_the_semiconductor_industry | shifts in the semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

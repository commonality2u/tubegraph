Evergrande Group, a sprawling company that once was China's biggest real estate conglomerate, has faced significant [[financial_strategies_and_challenges_faced_by_evergrande | financial challenges]], including billions of dollars in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The company's leadership and management decisions played a crucial role in its [[history_and_growth_of_evergrande_group | rapid growth]] and subsequent struggles.

## Founder and Key Figures

The founder and, until recently, chairman of Evergrande was **Xu Jiayin** (also referred to as Shu Jain in the transcript) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.
*   **Early Life and Career**
    *   Born in 1958, Xu was the son of a farmer and a veteran of the Second Sino-Japanese War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. His mother died when he was eight months old due to lack of money for medical treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
    *   At 16, in 1974, he graduated high school and, with college entrance exams closed, started his first business selling building materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
    *   He held various rural jobs, including cement factory worker, village security officer, and tractor driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
    *   In 1978, he ranked third out of 10 million students in the *gaokao* (college entrance exam) on his second attempt, gaining entrance to Wuhan University of Science and Technology, where he graduated with honors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
    *   After graduation, he married Yang Huaying, who shared a similar impoverished background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
    *   He worked for Ganan Wu Yang Iron and Steel Company for 10 years, managing over 300 employees as an assistant director of the heat treatment workshop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. He was known for managing with an "iron fist" but also paying attention to worker welfare, leading to high performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. He left after being investigated for selling scrap metal, which he claimed was to clear the floor and earn more money for workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.
    *   He then joined Shenzhen Dongdak Group as a salesperson, quickly rising to office director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. He demonstrated his "go-getter" nature by shepherding a steel trading alliance with his former company and implementing a double salary system for top workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Entry into Real Estate**
    *   In 1994, Xu pushed Dongdak to enter the real estate market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. He led a team of four workers to Guangzhou to develop the "Du Dao Garden" (Pearl Island Garden) project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
    *   This project successfully implemented a "low-cost, high-value" design, making premium real estate accessible to the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. By mid-1997, it generated a $31 million profit for Dongdak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.
    *   Despite this success, Xu's monthly salary was only $450 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. When his request for a raise was rejected, he left to start his own company at age 39 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

## Evergrande's Management Strategies

### Founding and Early Growth
In 1997, Xu started Evergrande Industrial Group in Guangzhou, a real estate company whose Chinese name means "endless from the past into the present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   **Initial Project (Jinbe Garden)**: With eight employees, Xu found a polluted, industrially zoned plot in Guangzhou <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. He acquired it at an extremely low price due to its issues, even convincing the government to allow installment payments for the land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
*   **Financing and Sales Model**: Evergrande borrowed 6 million RMB (about $870,000 USD) to pay the first installment and kickstart construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. They sold units "below cost" at 2,800 RMB per square meter, leading to a sales sensation that sold out in two hours, generating 80 million RMB ($12 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.
*   **Rapid Expansion**: This "first bucket of gold" enabled Evergrande to immediately begin development on 13 other projects in Guangzhou simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. By 1999, just two years after founding, it was Guangzhou's seventh largest real estate company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.
*   **National Expansion**: In 2006, Evergrande began national expansion, deploying 200 employees to cities like Wuhan and Chengdu with the goal of recreating "20 Evergrandes in just three years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

### San Gao Yidi (Three Highs, One Low)
Evergrande's early strategy during its high-growth years was summarized as "San Gao Yidi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>:
*   **High Debt**: The company relied heavily on debt to acquire its massive land bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. In 2006, it had $1 billion USD in debt against $1.2 billion USD in total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. This strategy was precarious but effective as long as land prices rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.
*   **High Leverage**: Utilizing borrowed funds to maximize returns.
*   **High Turnover**: Building and selling units extremely quickly to recover initial investments and reinvest in more land and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.
*   **Low Cost**: Focused on small units in previously "foul areas" targeted at the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

### Diversification and Investment Ventures
In mid-2014, Xu Jiayin unveiled a new strategy: "diversity plus scale plus brand," aiming to diversify operations beyond real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. This led to [[evergrandes_diversification_and_investment_ventures | Evergrande's diversification and investment ventures]]:
*   **Sports**: In 2010, Evergrande acquired the Guangzhou Football Club, investing 100 million RMB ($15 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. They stabilized the club, leading to seven straight Chinese Super League championships and the Asian Champions League title in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.
*   **Consumer Goods**: During a football event in 2013, Evergrande launched its mineral water product, Evergrande Beanchen, marketing it as high-end water from Changbai Mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>. Despite ambitious sales targets, the brand struggled to make a profit and was sold in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.
*   **Healthcare/Beauty**: In 2014, Evergrande acquired Yenchen Plastic Surgery, a chain of clinics, with Xu's wife Yang Huaying placed in charge of operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>. They later merged these with hospital chains to create Evergrande Health Industry Group Limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>.
*   **High-Tech and EVs**: In 2018, responding to [[chinese_governments_response_and_regulations_affecting_evergrande | Chinese government]] priorities, Xu announced Evergrande's entry into the high-tech industry, including quantum computing, AI, life sciences, and new energy vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:35:00">[20:35:00]</a>. After a failed attempt to acquire Faraday Future, Evergrande decided to go it alone, investing 45 billion RMB ($7 billion USD) over three years into electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>. They renamed Evergrande Health Industry Group to Evergrande Auto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:27:00">[21:27:00]</a>. In August 2020, they unveiled six vehicles under the Hangqi brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>. Despite major deals for sales networks and charging stations, the auto subsidiary had not sold a single car by April 2021 and was losing billions annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a>, indicating a speculative bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>.

### San Di (Three Lows, One High)
In early 2017, with total liabilities reaching 1.15 trillion RMB ($178 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>, Xu announced a reversal of strategy to "San Di" (three lows, one high) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>:
*   **Low Debt**
*   **Low Leverage**
*   **Low Cost**
*   **High Turnover**
The goal was to lower debt ratios and raise net assets, aligning with the [[chinese_governments_response_and_regulations_affecting_evergrande | Chinese government's]] push to deleverage the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>. This led to asset sales, investment funds raised, and debt reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. However, total liabilities continued to rise in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>.

## Relationship with Government and Political Ties
Xu Jiayin maintained strong ties to the [[chinese_governments_response_and_regulations_affecting_evergrande | Chinese government]]:
*   **Philanthropy**: He is considered China's most generous individual in terms of charity, winning the China Charity Award for eight consecutive years and donating billions in cash annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Ties**: Xu was willing to use these ties to protect the company. For example, when American short-selling firm Citron Research published a report in 2012 claiming Evergrande was insolvent, the Hong Kong authorities launched a years-long civil case against Andrew Left, banning him from trading in Hong Kong for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>.

## Recent Developments and Leadership Change
In August 2020, [[chinese_governments_response_and_regulations_affecting_evergrande | Chinese government]] ministries introduced the "three red lines" regulations to control real estate companies' debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>. Evergrande failed all three metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>.
*   This caught Xu off guard, leading him to announce drastic price slashes on new builds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:00]</a>.
*   A leaked letter in September 2020, believed to be authentic, showed Evergrande requesting the Guangdong provincial government's help to coordinate a reorganization of its entities, warning of a potential cash flow crunch if a reorganization wasn't completed by February 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38:00">[26:38:00]</a>.
*   On August 17, 2021, amidst turmoil, Xu Jiayin resigned as Evergrande's chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>. Zhao Tanglong stepped up as chairman, general manager, and legal representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:59:00">[30:59:00]</a>.

Despite the change in leadership, the situation remains ongoing, with many expecting Evergrande to go to court for debt resolution and be slowly broken up, similar to the [[collapse_of_daewoo_group | collapse of Daewoo Group]] or the handling of Anbang Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:27:00">[31:27:00]</a>. The government's decision not to bail out the company aligns with its social equality goals of lower real estate prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>.

Europe's current position as a minor producer and consumer of chips was not inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. While Europeans independently invented the first transistor just months after the Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, this early lead was squandered, and by 1960, even Japan produced more transistors than France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The European semiconductor lag has persisted for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This article examines how the advancements and market dynamics of the American and Japanese semiconductor industries contributed to Europe's decline.

## American Influence: Early Dominance and Innovation

The American semiconductor industry significantly impacted Europe's trajectory due to its rapid innovation, strategic knowledge sharing, and strong demand drivers.

### Knowledge Dispersal and Manufacturing Discipline
Bell Labs, after creating the first transistor in 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, quickly dispersed its production knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. They held open symposiums detailing production and liberally granted licenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, partly due to anti-trust concerns and a belief in spreading knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This approach allowed many licensees, including Texas Instruments, to contribute new innovations like the silicon junction transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

In contrast, French semiconductor efforts struggled with manufacturing unpredictability, leading them to focus conservatively on abstract and theoretical research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. American teams were more interdisciplinary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. For instance, William Shockley, a transistor inventor, deliberately recruited an interdisciplinary group for Fairchild Semiconductor, most of whom trained in physics, mechanical engineering, or optics, rather than semiconductors directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Shockley also encouraged scientists to handle technological processes themselves to devise improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This hands-on approach led to breakthroughs like the planar process, sketched by Jean Hoerni in 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, which allowed Fairchild to produce reliable transistors at high scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Military Demand vs. Consumer Focus
A critical factor was the U.S. military's role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. By the 1960s, the military purchased half of the American semiconductor industry's total output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Projects like the Minuteman II ICBM (1962) and the Apollo program (1961-1965) drove demand for powerful guidance computers, prioritizing smaller, lower-power, and reliable devices over cheaper ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This pushed American firms to develop and hone techniques for high-performing devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

In contrast, European semiconductor demand in the 1960s primarily came from the consumer sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. While the military made up 50% of the U.S. market in 1960, it was only 29% in France, 8% in West Germany, and 8% in Italy in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Consumer demand prioritized price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. European giants like Philips and Siemens focused on evolutionary improvements to in-house germanium transistor technologies, which were cheap but suffered mechanical limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. They believed silicon was only suitable for high-temperature applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Meanwhile, American startups like Shockley Semiconductor, Fairchild, Intel, and AMD emerged, seeing semiconductors as an end product and pioneering disruptive silicon technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Fairchild's mass production of silicon planar transistors obsoleted the entire alloy junction transistor space, widening the gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

## Japanese Influence: Catch-up and Generational Lead

Japan, starting from a position similar to France or Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, rapidly adopted transistor technology, serving as both a model and later a dominant competitor for Europe.

### Rapid Adoption and Government Support
The Japanese consumer electronics industry quickly adopted transistor technology and caught up to the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Products like Sony's transistor radio grew on domestic demand, encouraged by government promotion of radio and television adoption in the 1950s and 60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. The government also gated imports, allowing its industry to build semiconductor manufacturing competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Mass semiconductor production in Japan kicked off in 1955 and grew 125 times by the late 1950s, matching American levels by 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

To advance their proficiency, Japanese companies signed over 250 technology licensing agreements with foreign companies from 1952 to 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. By the mid-1960s, they were producing their own innovations on top of these acquired technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. In contrast, despite IBM and Texas Instruments building factories on European soil in the 1960s, successful technology transfer to European companies never fully happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### The VLSI Project and Generational Lead
By the 1970s, the microprocessor (Intel 4004, 1971) ushered in an era of rapidly increasing complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>, with tens of thousands of transistors on a single chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. This "large-scale systems" (LSI) era required significant investment for new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. While Japan initially fell behind the U.S. in LSI systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, its political leadership responded.

Alarmed by IBM's dominance in the computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>, Japan launched the very large-scale integration ([[government_subsidies_and_their_effects_on_the_semiconductor_industry | VLSI]]) project in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. This project, budgeted hundreds of millions of dollars, united computer makers to cooperatively develop next-generation VLSI technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. Though it didn't achieve its one-chip computer goal, it helped Japanese semiconductor makers hone techniques to put tens of thousands of transistors onto a single chip, rocketing them into the generational lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:18">[00:21:18]</a>. This, combined with ample capital and a shift to CMOS technology, revitalized Japan's semiconductor manufacturing and equipment industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

West Germany's industrial policy, in contrast, was more market-oriented and decentralized, relying on large flagship companies like Siemens and AEG, which lagged the Americans by a decade in the late 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. Government funding was funneled through these conservative firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>, which preferred investing in bonds over technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

## Europe's Response and Intensified Competition (1980s-1990s)

The 1980s and 90s saw Europe continue to struggle against the compounding technological and financial might of the American and Japanese industries.

### Alliance Strategies and Shifting Policies
By the 1980s, Europe faced a large and growing information technology trade deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>. European tech companies often struck technology alliances with American firms rather than other European ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. For example, Sweden's Ericsson and its subsidiary Rifa allied with National Semiconductor, then GEC, Plessey, AMD, and Texas Instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:22">[00:25:22]</a>. Philips worked with AMD, RCA, and Texas Instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>, while Siemens allied with Intel, Toshiba, and Fujitsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>. Only 25% of European IT companies formed alliances with other European companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

Despite "untold sums of money" spent on national champions in earlier decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>, European policymakers shifted focus. France launched a microelectronics plan in 1982 to spend 4.5 billion francs annually on chip R&D and subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. West Germany's government launched a semiconductor R&D program in 1984 with a billion Deutsche marks, including the "Mega project" with Philips to develop DRAM and SRAM chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. Though Siemens debuted their 4-megabit chip in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a>, they had to license 1-megabit DRAM technology from Toshiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>, and Japan's NTT had already debuted a 16-megabit DRAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

### Challenges to Pan-European Efforts
The Mega project evolved into the Joint European Submicron Silicon Initiative (JESSI) in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>, a pan-European consortium. However, JESSI suffered serious issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>:
*   Philips pulled out of memory entirely in 1990 due to financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.
*   Britain's ICL was ejected after being acquired by Fujitsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.
*   Siemens allied with IBM, abandoning their 16-megabit memory plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.

JESSI's budget shrank, and by 1991, European companies had less than 30% of their own market, down from 60% of world production in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.

### Rise of Asian Foundries and Continued Disadvantage
The 1990s saw technological and financial barriers to semiconductor entry skyrocket, with a 250-nanometer memory fab costing billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. Competition intensified with Asian companies like TSMC, Charter Semiconductor, and Samsung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. TSMC's pioneering independent foundry model opened up semiconductor outsourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>, accumulating scale. South Korean firms benefited from *chaebol* structures that bankrolled initial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>.

These shifts continued to [[factors_contributing_to_europes_decline_in_semiconductor_production | disfavor Europe]]. European firms lost the consumer electronics space to Asian ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. Military and government spending declined after the fall of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>, and computing remained dominated by American firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. Europe's strengths remained in industrial, telecommunications, and automobile fields, but these did not capture the majority of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

## Conclusion

Europe's semiconductor decline was a compounded situation over half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. While Europe discovered transistor technology early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>, it fell behind due to political, technological, and production issues in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. Strong American military spending drove technological progress and favored smaller, disruptive startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. In the 1970s, as semiconductor competence grew, Europe incorrectly disregarded semiconductors as a future focus, prioritizing bigger computers, unlike Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>. The 1980s and 90s saw the rise of semiconductor manufacturing outsourcing and the Asian supply chain intensify market competition, relegating European manufacturers to specialty markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

Despite consistent government support and R&D coordination, Europe's market share in semiconductor production has remained around 10% since 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. The question remains whether initiatives like the EU Chips Act can reverse this long-standing trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>.

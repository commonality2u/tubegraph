At its peak, Indonesia's Salim Group was a $22 billion giant, the country's largest business group, led by its founder Lim Sol Young (also known as Sudono Salim), who was Southeast Asia's richest man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. His incredible rise was due to his personal connection with authoritarian leader Suharto, who relied on Salim Group as a core collaborator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The history of the Salim Group and other ethnic Chinese businesses in Indonesia is marked by unique challenges and controversies, often tied to political changes and ethnic tensions.

## Early Life and Initial Discrimination

Lim Sol Young, born Lin Xiaolian, fled the Second Sino-Japanese War fighting in 1938 at the age of 21, arriving in Java <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. He leveraged a thriving network of family and ethnic clan members for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Lim became an ethnic Chinese trader, initially selling clothes and later starting a coffee grinding business with his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia, Lim, being an ethnic Chinese, was under suspicion and was once arrested for having a gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. He survived by selling various goods, including fermented tofu, peanuts, rice wine, and fruits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Post-Independence: Discrimination under Sukarno

The early days of Indonesian independence under Sukarno were difficult for the Chinese ethnic minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Despite warming relations with the People's Republic of China, Indonesia's Chinese minorities faced discrimination and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Their dominance in the business sector and perceived support of the Dutch colonialists generated resentment, leading to anti-Chinese violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The government did not appear sufficiently concerned to protect them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

In 1952, facing racial discrimination in rural areas, Lim, like many others of his ethnicity, moved to Jakarta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Rise through [[crony_capitalism_and_its_role_in_building_indonesias_largest_business_empire | Crony Capitalism]] under Suharto

Long before Suharto's rise, the military and business community in Indonesia were closely and corruptly intertwined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. When the Republican government failed to provide enough financial resources to its fighting units, commanders united with local businessmen, often ethnic Chinese, to raise funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. These businessmen, known as "kukong" (Hokkian for Boss), received favors and concessions in exchange for funneling cash to military men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

After Suharto ascended to power, this system strengthened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. He crafted a [[crony_capitalism_and_its_role_in_building_indonesias_largest_business_empire | crony capitalist]] political pyramid where the government partnered with economic cronies in the private sector to achieve its goals, who in turn received preferential benefits and generated profits for redistribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Suharto and his government were careful to separate economic and political power, ensuring that his Chinese business partners relied on him for their protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Lim started as one of Suharto's "Chinese cuckoo" (kukong) but quickly rose to become the biggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## The Asian Financial Crisis and its Aftermath

The [[impact_of_the_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | Asian financial crisis]] deeply affected many Indonesian banks, as foreign-denominated debt grew in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. The IMF bailout package, announced in October 1997, came with stringent economic reform conditions, including disassembling state and private monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. These reforms attacked monopolies in various sectors (cloves, cashews, oranges, vanilla) and removed tax incentives for a national car manufacturing initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. Many of these monopolies were dominated by Suharto's cronies and family, directly impacting his supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

### Mass Riots and Targeted Violence

In May 1998, mass riots broke out in response to cuts in fuel subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. Many of these riots specifically targeted ethnic Chinese and their businesses, causing millions of dollars in damage and injuring many Chinese individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. Lim was out of the country during the riots, having mostly relocated to Singapore, but rioters attacked and set his home on fire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. His son and financial heir, Anthony Salim, had to pay bribes to pass roadblocks to evacuate the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

BCA (Bank Central Asia) and other Salim companies suffered massive fire damage from the riots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. The bank's association with a government crony (Suharto) turned against it after his fall, leading to a "titanic run" on BCA that caused its collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. The central bank had to take over BCA and its $5 billion in debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.

## Rebuilding and Resilience

With Suharto's resignation in May 1998, the massive and largely insolvent Salim Empire began to break apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. Popular fury towards Lim and his family was fierce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. However, Anthony Salim, a "fierce negotiator," managed to secure a settlement with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. Salim Group handed over stakes in over 100 Indonesian businesses, including Indo Cement and Indomobile, to repay the $5 billion bailout for BCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. Crucially, Salim managed to retain a 50.1% share in their food company, Indofood, and moved these holdings offshore to the family's First Pacific financial company in Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. This proved to be a savvy move, as Indofood has since become one of the world's biggest food companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.

Lim never returned to Indonesia after 1998, dying peacefully in Singapore in 2012 at age 95 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>. His journey exemplifies the complex and often precarious position of ethnic Chinese businessmen in Indonesia, balancing political connections with the risk of public backlash and economic instability.

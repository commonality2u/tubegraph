From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Bulgaria, a middle-sized country in southeastern Europe, made remarkable advancements in the electronics and computer industry, especially during the Cold War era. By 1989, Bulgaria alone exported more computers than all other Eastern Bloc countries combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It was the only COMECON country producing hard disk drive memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. At its peak, over 11% of all Bulgarian workers were employed in electronics production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, and the country produced some of the world's first electronic calculators and personal computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The nation's ambition was to emulate Japan's economic success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This article explores [[the_rise_and_fall_of_the_bulgarian_computer_industry | the unlikely rise and fall of the Bulgarian computer industry]] and its innovations in electronics and semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Early Ambitions and Context

After World War II, following the Soviet Union's entry into Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Communist Party established the People's Republic of Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The Party focused on rebuilding the war-damaged economy, modeling its policies after the Soviet Union, which provided loans, raw materials, and purchased Bulgarian finished goods on generous terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Under Todor Zhivkov, who led the Bulgarian Communist Party for 35 years starting in 1953, Bulgaria experienced political and economic stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Zhivkov, admiring Japan's economy, aimed for Bulgaria to develop in heavy industry and electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. He considered electronics to be the nation's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

In the 1950s, Bulgarian scientists began studying Soviet cybernetics and the economic potential of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. While the Soviet Union's MESM computer was operational by 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, and countries like East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary, and Poland were building their own first-generation computers by the late 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, Bulgaria lagged in developing its own. Catch-up efforts were complicated by Western export restrictions under COCOM, which prevented access to high-technology tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

In 1956, Professor Ljubomir Iliev attended a conference in Moscow where Soviet delegates recommended that all socialist countries establish their own computing centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This spurred the Bulgarian government to raise funds and recruit staff, leading to the creation of the Mathematical Institute with Computing Institute in 1961 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Pioneering Computers: Vitosha

In early 1962, Professor Iliev's team began work on the Vitosha (Витоша), Bulgaria's first digital computer, completed in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Modeled after Romania's CIFA computers, Vitosha was a large machine, 4 meters long and 2 meters tall, containing about 1,500 vacuum tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. It had a magnetic drum memory storing 4,096 40-bit "words" and could perform 2,000 operations per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Data was input via tape punch, and results were output at 15 characters per second on an electrical typewriter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Vitosha was showcased at the "Bulgaria Builds Socialism" exhibition in Moscow, where it demonstrated its ability to solve math equations and present graphical information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. However, Vitosha was tragically destroyed after returning to Bulgaria due to a burst hot water pipe, leading to its dismantling for scrap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

Despite its demise, Vitosha generated significant political support for further computer development in Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

## The ELKA Calculator Era

In 1964, Professor Ivan Popov, chairman of Bulgaria's State Committee for Science and Technical Progress, played a pivotal role in steering the country towards electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Popov, considered the founder of Bulgaria's computer industry, admired modern technology as essential for the country's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

Popov challenged Iliev's team to reverse-engineer and produce their own version of the Sumlock ANITA calculator, the world's first all-electronic calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. The ANITA used vacuum tubes, including Dekatron tubes, which were unavailable in the Soviet Bloc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Innovatively, the Bulgarian team re-engineered the design to use transistors instead of tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

This led to the creation of the ELKA (ЕЛКА) 6521 in 1965, short for "electronic calculator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Weighing 8.5 kilograms, the ELKA 6521 used Germanium transistors and could perform square root calculations, integer division, and averaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. It was one of the first transistorized, all-electronic desktop calculators of its kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, comparable to the American Friden EC-130 and Japanese Sharp CS-10A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

The ELKA 6521 was approved by the Politburo and exhibited at the INFORGA-65 show in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Popov secured a high-volume sales contract with the Soviet Gosplan (state planning committee) for ELKA calculators by bluffing about large-scale factory readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. While the first model didn't sell to the Russians, a simplified and cheaper version, the ELKA-22, was developed in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. They also produced the ELKA-25, likely the first calculator with a printer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Popov then successfully negotiated a deal with Gosplan for 700 roubles per ELKA, undercutting East Germany's offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

In 1967, the industrial conglomerate DSO IZOT was established to develop and produce calculating machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. From 1967 to 1984, IZOT generated over 11 billion leva in export revenues, with exports extending beyond the Soviet Union to Switzerland and Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. The ELKA-42, an [[early_innovations_in_semiconductors_by_european_scientists | IC-based electronic calculator]], was displayed at the Osaka World Expo in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. ELKA also diversified into cash registers, exporting thousands to Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Advancements in Semiconductors

Bulgaria's rapid catch-up in electronics was partly due to its growing semiconductor capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Alongside IZOT's founding, the Institute of Microelectronics was established, featuring a design house in Sofia and a production fab in Botevgrad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

The Institute was led by physicist Yordan Kasabov, a Bulgarian microelectronics pioneer who had produced the country's first domestic MOS transistors the year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Kasabov and his team rapidly advanced Bulgaria's semiconductor capacity, designing and manufacturing ICs for the ELKA-42 using modern processes such as photolithography, wet etch, deposition, ion implantation, and plasma etch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

Around 1972 or 1973, Kasabov and Lubomir Antonov visited Silicon Valley, observing the rapid growth of the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Recognizing the potential of highly integrated ICs, they aimed to create similar components upon their return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This led to the production of microprocessors like the CM-400, which facilitated the development of more advanced 4-chip calculators, such as the ELKA-50 series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

## Contribution to the Unified System of Computers

In 1969, the Soviet Bloc countries decided to collaboratively produce the Unified System of Computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. To circumvent the notoriously slow CMEA (COMECON), an alternative organization, the Intergovernmental Commission on Computing Technology (IGCCT), was founded by Russia, East Germany, Bulgaria, and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

Ivan Popov ensured Bulgaria secured an important role in the Unified System's production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Out of 105 assigned items, Bulgaria was responsible for three of the most valuable: memory disks, magnetic memory tapes, and a processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. To achieve this, Popov arranged technology transfer agreements with Western companies, such as Fujitsu for memory tape design, and copied IBM's disk drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. He also rapidly coordinated the simultaneous construction of seven new plants to manufacture these components, including magnetic heads for disk drives and ferrite memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

This strategic positioning gave Bulgaria a virtual monopoly on highly profitable products like hard disk drives within the Eastern Bloc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, selling them at very high prices with margins reaching 200-300% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. These electronics exports, combined with favorable Soviet oil re-export deals, significantly bolstered the Bulgarian economy throughout the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

## The Rise of Personal Computers: Pravetz

While Bulgaria produced mainframes and minicomputers throughout the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, the country also made early inroads into the personal computing boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

In 1979, microelectronics engineer Ivan Marangozov led a team at the Institute of Technical Cybernetics and Robotics to clone an imported Apple II computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. The resulting IMKO-1 ("Individual Micro Computer") was an almost identical clone, even retaining the same ROM (with a name change), but with Cyrillic keyboard characters and using slow tape cassette memory instead of floppy disk drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Although only a limited number were produced, they were popular and highly functional, demonstrated controlling a robot arm at an exhibition in England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

The IMKO-1's success led to the IMKO-2, a version designed for mass production and modeled on the cheaper Apple IIe PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. It incorporated a Synertek 6502 CPU (a MOS 6502 clone) and an optional floppy drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Production moved to a new factory in Pravetz, Todor Zhivkov's hometown, leading to the commercial name Pravetz-82, for its production start year of 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

Pravetz PCs, though expensive for the average Bulgarian, became reasonably accessible and very popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. Production rapidly scaled from 500 units in 1983 to 18,000 two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Many Bulgarians learned programming on Pravetz PCs in schools, and by 1987, there were over 500 computer clubs in Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. Pravetz produced various 8-bit and 16-bit PC variants, with peak factory output reaching about 60,000 computers annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. Many were exported to the Soviet Union, other COMECON countries, and even some Western nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. Bulgaria also developed sophisticated supercomputers, like the IZOT-1014, which powered geological centers across the Soviet Union and impressed even Americans, with exports reaching countries like India by 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

## Challenges and Decline

By the late 1970s, Bulgaria had become one of the top 10 largest electronics manufacturing countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. However, [[challenges_and_missed_opportunities_in_the_bulgarian_electronics_industry | troubles were on the horizon]]. The Bulgarian government ceased investing in microelectronics in the 1970s, likely due to military and heavy industry priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This led to the semiconductor industry hitting serious limits, hindering Bulgaria's competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. For example, while the Institute of Microelectronics designed an IC for pocket-sized calculators, the fab could not manufacture it, forcing IZOT to import foreign ICs for their ELKA-100 series, making them more expensive than Japanese and Western counterparts <a class="yt=timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.

A significant [[the_impact_of_soviet_influence_on_bulgarias_technology_sector | missed opportunity]] arose when Rockwell, an American company, visited Sofia to discuss a technology collaboration for semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. A deal was struck, but at the last moment, State Security intervened, preventing the contract from being signed. Years later, it was learned that Soviet authorities believed the deal would bring Bulgaria too close to the United States, harming Soviet interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. This decision was a devastating blow to the future of the Bulgarian semiconductor industry, ensuring that more sophisticated Bulgarian computers would always rely on imported chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

By 1988, the Bulgarian computer industry employed over 169,000 people, roughly 12% of the country's labor force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. However, political changes began in 1989 with Todor Zhivkov's resignation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 proved fatal; 95% of Bulgaria's electronics revenue came from within the Soviet Bloc, with the USSR being the largest market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Dependent on Soviet markets and Western-sourced critical goods, which became prohibitively expensive as Bulgaria's currency weakened, the industry had no alternative markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. The opening of Bulgaria's markets in the early 1990s brought in extremely cheap South Korean and Taiwanese PCs, causing demand for Pravetz PCs to plummet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. The factories closed in 1994, leading to a rapid collapse of the once-formidable industry, with employment crashing from nearly 200,000 to just 30,000 people in a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

## Conclusion

Bulgaria's strong link to the Soviet Union both facilitated and hampered its technological ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. The Soviet market provided a crucial customer and Bulgaria's monopoly on valuable computer parts was a significant economic boon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. However, this reliance also restricted exports to the West and capped technological progress by preventing deeper collaborations, ultimately leading to [[the_rise_and_fall_of_the_bulgarian_computer_industry | the industry's demise]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. Zhivkov's vision of transforming Bulgaria into "another Japan" came tantalizingly close, only to vanish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.

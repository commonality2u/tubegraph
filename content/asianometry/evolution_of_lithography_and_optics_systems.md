Germany-based Carl Zeiss AG is a crucial supplier in the semiconductor industry, providing the optic systems vital for multi-million dollar photolithography machines made by [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] [00:00:22]. These "optics systems" are massive, multi-component systems capable of etching patterns as wide as a small virus [00:00:10]. Without Zeiss's optics, [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] would not have machines for TSMC, Samsung, or Intel [00:00:26].

## Carl Zeiss AG: A Historical Overview

Carl Zeiss AG was founded in 1846 by Carl Zeiss, a German scientific instrument maker born in 1816 [00:01:19]. Zeiss's workshop, established in 1846, repaired university equipment, made microscopes, and sold scientific instruments, including eyeglass lenses and thermometers [00:01:38].

In 1866, Zeiss recruited Ernst Abbe, a physicist from the University of Jena [00:01:53]. Abbe's insights into the movement of light rays through microscope lenses helped the company move beyond crude trial-and-error manufacturing [00:01:57]. After Carl Zeiss died in 1888, Abbe took over and diversified the company into measuring instruments, camera lenses, and telescopes [00:02:13]. By World War I, Zeiss was the world's largest maker of cameras, but 80% of its revenue came from military optics products [00:02:37].

After Zeiss's death, Ernst Abbe purchased sole ownership of the company and transferred it to the Carl Zeiss Foundation [00:02:55]. Abbe structured the foundation to guarantee the company's continued existence and allow employees to partake in its economic success, optimizing for long-term economic success with excess profits invested into the working population of Jena [00:03:27]. This makes it more akin to a cooperative than a charity [00:03:46].

### Post-WWII Division and Reunification

Following World War II, the company was split. The United States Army spirited away 130 of Zeiss's top technicians and executives to West Germany [00:04:28]. In 1947, the Soviet army shipped 94% of Zeiss's Jena-based equipment and 300 employees to the Soviet Union as war booty, which later helped found the Kiev brand of cameras [00:04:51]. This resulted in two separate Zeiss entities: Zeiss Oberkochen (West Germany) and Zeiss Jena (East Germany) [00:05:06]. They competed for decades, eventually agreeing to split the world for trademark use [00:05:31]. Zeiss Jena, in particular, became an East German flagship company, diversifying into military technology, space technology, and semiconductors [00:06:08].

German reunification presented challenges for Zeiss Jena due to economic disadvantage and the loss of the Soviet military market [00:06:17]. After years of negotiation, the traditional parts of Zeiss Jena (microscopes, medical instruments) and the Zeiss name were acquired by the West German entity [00:06:55]. The remaining diversified firm, renamed Jenoptik, operated in semiconductors, laser optics, and automation [00:07:09]. The German government stepped in to save the company, buying 80% of its assets and preserving jobs [00:07:20]. Jenoptik later conducted a successful IPO in 1998 [00:07:28].

## Carl Zeiss SMT: Specialization in Semiconductor Manufacturing

Today, Carl Zeiss AG is a large company with four segments: industrial quality and research, medical technology, consumer markets, and semiconductor manufacturing [00:07:36]. Zeiss invests heavily in R&D, spending 812 million euros in 2020, or 13% of its revenue [00:08:05].

Carl Zeiss SMT, the semiconductor manufacturing division, is a joint venture between Carl Zeiss AG (majority share) and [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] (24.9% stake) [00:08:31]. Zeiss SMT's core product consists of the optics at the heart of the lithography scanners and steppers made by [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] [00:08:44].

### Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) Lithography Optics

[[history_and_evolution_of_lithography_technology | Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) lithography]] uses ultraviolet light rays in the 193 nanometer or 248 nanometer range [00:08:54]. Zeiss has been building deep ultraviolet imaging systems for nearly 100 years [00:09:07]. Ernst Abbe himself proposed the possibility of a microscope using ultraviolet light as far back as 1874 [00:09:12]. By 1899, the company developed a quartz lens suitable for UV microscopes [00:09:22].

In the 1960s, Zeiss leveraged its microscope techniques to build the first lenses for microlithography [00:09:30]. Microlithography requires tight control of light distortions across a large space [00:09:40]. To achieve this, Zeiss combined multiple smaller lenses into a massive optics system featuring a "double bulge" structure [00:09:55]. This design reduces field curvature, a common optical problem where objects are only sharp within a certain area, which would cause inaccuracies in IC design transfer [00:10:09].

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Zeiss continued to refine its techniques to increase resolution [00:10:35]. A major breakthrough came in the 2000s with immersion lithography [00:10:50]. This technique, first validated for semiconductor use by Taiwanese scientist Burn Lin, replaces the air gap between the wafer and the stepper with water [00:11:01]. By shooting ultraviolet light through water, foundries could etch structures as small as 40 nanometers [00:11:16]. Zeiss's top products for this technique are the Starlith 1900 series, including the 1900i [00:11:21].

### Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography Optics

[[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography]] is the next step in the semiconductor fabrication roadmap and is a disruptive technology used in today's cutting-edge process nodes [00:11:48]. Its very short wavelength necessitates radical changes to the optics system [00:11:58]. The key challenge is that all available materials, including air, absorb high-energy UV light, meaning traditional lenses are not possible [00:12:06].

To overcome this, Zeiss had to craft an optic system entirely out of multi-layer mirrors [00:12:18]. Zeiss began working on its [[the_evolution_of_euv_lithography | EUV optics system]] in 1995 with the initiation of a micro exposure tool [00:12:26]. Collaborating with Lawrence Livermore National Lab and Berkeley Lab in California, Zeiss delivered the first prototype in 2003, refining the design five more times over subsequent years [00:12:36].

In 2015, the first full-field [[the_evolution_of_euv_lithography | EUV optics system]], named the Starlith 3100, was delivered to [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]] for their Alpha Demo Tool (ADT) [00:12:51]. The Starlith is a multi-component system comprising collector optics, aperture illumination optics, reticle, and projection optics [00:13:17].

The process flow within the Starlith system is as follows:
1.  Light from the [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV light source]] hits the collector, which gathers and projects it through an aperture [00:13:27].
2.  This light then enters the illuminator, which spreads it out evenly [00:13:34].
3.  The now uniformly illuminated light reflects off the reticle, which contains the IC chip designs [00:13:39].
4.  Finally, the design is projected onto the wafer [00:13:46].

The Starlith 3100 pioneered the optical system's core mechanics, which were later refined in subsequent releases like the Starlith 3300 and 3400 [00:13:50]. Today, these systems are a critical part of [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV-based process nodes]] at seven nanometers or lower [00:14:00].

## Zeiss's Position in the Industry

The semiconductor division contributed 30% of Zeiss's group business in 2020, with 1.8 billion euro in revenue, and holds critical strategic importance in German industry [00:14:24]. Carl Zeiss AG, with its unique ownership structure, is basically the only company of its type [00:14:40]. Unlike Zeiss and [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | ASML]]'s collaboration, competitors like Japan-based Nikon and Canon make their own optics systems for their lithography devices, an arrangement that has not worked as well [00:14:55]. The complexity of Zeiss's DUV and [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV optics systems]] is described as "fantastically complicated," making it challenging for competitors to catch up [00:15:13].

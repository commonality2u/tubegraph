Currently, [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV)]] lithography is operating at its boundaries, with dozens of $150 million machines used to create patterns nanometers wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite decades of industry effort on this intricate technology, there is no time to rest, as [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] is already focusing on the next generation: High Numerical Aperture [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] (High NA [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This $300 million machine is designed to surpass regular [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] in capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Need for High NA EUV

While current [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] technology technically works, significant [[challenges_in_developing_euv_systems | challenges]] remain at the commercial level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The most significant problem is throughput, which refers to the number of wafers a single machine can produce over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

For instance, TSMC's leading-edge N5 process currently requires about 14 to 15 [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Since [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] machines are slower than older ones, more machines are needed to maintain wafer output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. In 2020, TSMC acquired 50% of [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]]'s installed [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. However, each N5 wafer is estimated by industry analysts to cost nearly $17,000, akin to the price of a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. To reduce this [[economic_impact_and_cost_considerations_of_euv_technology | cost]], faster throughput is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

TSMC's next full-step node, N3, uses even more [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] layers—around 20 to 25, compared to N5's 14 to 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This risks a further decline in throughput, hindering the ability to produce enough wafers and achieve economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Furthermore, for N3, TSMC may need to use a technique called multiple patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This involves using another exposure to enhance feature density, effectively doubling or tripling the processing time for a single layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Multi-patterning makes already slow [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] decidedly uneconomical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. While buying more $150 million [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] machines is an option, [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] is already selling them as fast as they can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. A more economical solution is [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] machines that perform lithography better and faster, which is the core purpose of High NA [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### The Role of Numerical Aperture (NA)

NA, a dimensionless number, measures how much light an optical system can collect and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Its significance is rooted in Rayleigh's formula:

> Resolution = k1 × light wavelength / NA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>

To improve resolution, one must either decrease k1, shrink the wavelength, or increase the NA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The k1 factor is nearing its physical limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The first generation of [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] already reduced the light wavelength to its current 13.5 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Therefore, the last remaining major factor to enhance resolution is to increase the NA by re-engineering the optics to collect and focus more [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

[[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]]'s most advanced current [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] machine, the NXE 3600D, has an NA of 0.33, translating to a 26-nanometer pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This meets TSMC's N5 process requirements for a 28-nanometer pitch and can produce about 160 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

[[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]]'s first High NA [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] machine, the EXE 5000, will increase the NA from 0.33 to 0.55, which translates to a 16-nanometer pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This 67% improvement is crucial for the N3 process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. High NA [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] can not only perform lithography with a much smaller pitch but also print at a significantly higher resolution, leading to fewer defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Fewer defects result in more good wafers per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. If High NA [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] performs as advertised, it can replace multi-patterning layers previously done at lower wavelengths, meaning one pass instead of two or three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Such savings justify the use of High NA [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Technical Aspects and Challenges

There are two major [[challenges_in_developing_euv_systems | challenges]] associated with High NA [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]]: the optics and the resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Optics

The optics system, specifically the Zeiss Starlit 5000, must be redesigned to allow light at more angles to hit the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Previous systems with 0.33 NA had a thinner light cone at Mirror 6 (M6), positioned right above the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Increasing to 0.55 NA necessitates a thicker M6 light cone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

This leads to a challenge with Mirror 5 (M5), the mirror immediately preceding M6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Multi-layer mirrors, with their 50 [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] reflecting layers, are limited to reflecting at very specific angles (about 13 degrees) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This requires M5 to be positioned very close to the M6 light cone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. In this setup, the two light cones would interfere, causing significant imaging errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

To overcome this, engineers drill oval-shaped holes, known as obscurations, into the mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. These obscurations reduce the angular spread on the mirrors and substantially increase the transmission of the optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Mask/Reticle

A similar effect occurs at the reticle or mask stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The mask, which contains the chip design pattern, is essentially a grating in front of a mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Redesigning a mask costs millions of dollars, so a key design requirement for High NA [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] is that the mask size cannot change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. To achieve high NA at the wafer stage, a high NA is also required at the mask stage, as the two are mathematically linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

The Twinscan NXE 30300B, an [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]]-enabled machine with 0.33 NA, uses a magnification factor of 4x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Its reticle mirror reflects [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] light at 6 degrees, projecting a 132mm x 104mm reticle area onto a 33mm x 26mm wafer area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Increasing the NA causes the two light cones to become larger and overlap by one degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Raising the [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] light reflection angle (e.g., from 6 to 9 degrees) is not feasible due to mask shadowing effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

The solution was to change the magnification factor, raising it from 4x to 8x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. While this achieves the higher NA without fat cones or compromised mask shadows, magnifying by 8x makes the light area at the wafer end smaller, shrinking the 33mm x 26mm wafer area to a quarter of its size (16.5mm x 13mm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. This is economically unacceptable for customers, as it would make the machine four times slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

Instead, Zeiss and [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] utilized **anamorphic imaging** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Magnification factors can exist independently on the x and y axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. By applying the 8x magnification factor only along the y-axis, the system can project a 16.5mm x 26mm field, which is a half-size but barely acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. This technology was borrowed from the movie industry, where it's used to project widescreen movies onto standard screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Resist

The other major [[challenges_in_developing_euv_systems | challenge]] lies with the photoresist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Applied on top of the substrate before [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] exposure, a higher NA requires the resist to be thinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. This reduces the risk of pattern or line collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. If the resist is too thick, lines after [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] exposure will be too close together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. After washing and drying the wafer, surface tension from the water can distort the design, causing lines to fall over or peel off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. The aim is a resist layer at least 50% thicker than the pitch; for a 16-nanometer pitch, this means a 20-nanometer thick resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Companies are experimenting with new resists, and [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] is collaborating with partners like IMEC, PSI, and CXRO to find a suitable candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### Other Engineering Challenges

Additional [[technical_and_engineering_aspects_of_high_na_euv | engineering challenges]] include making bigger mirrors, optimizing the mask frame layout, the pellicle, and especially the metrology system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Metrology, which involves sensors and programs to check progress and quality, is crucial for inspecting lines less than 20 nanometers wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] is exploring e-beam inspection techniques, but this is yet to be finalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. The fundamental technology exists, but the challenge lies in transforming it into a shippable, competitive product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

## Economic Considerations

The EXE 5000 High NA [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] machine is projected to be massive, "as big as a crouched T-Rex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. It will also come with a massive price tag, topping $300 million each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This [[economic_impact_and_cost_considerations_of_euv_technology | monstrous price]] will need to be justified by its engineering marvels and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The EXE 5000 machine remains in development, with the first deliveries to customers expected in late 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. An improved version, the EXE 5200, is anticipated two years later in 2024 or 2025, with an expected throughput of 220 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

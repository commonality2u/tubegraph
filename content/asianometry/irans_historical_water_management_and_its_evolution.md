Iran has a long-standing water problem due to its historically arid climate and low rainfall, with much of its central lands being uninhabitable without water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The country ranks 158th out of 189 countries in annual average precipitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Seventy-five percent of this precipitation falls on just 25% of the country's area, with 50% occurring during winter months and only 4% in summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Certain central desert areas receive less than 50 millimeters of rainfall annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

While Iran borders the Caspian Sea to the north and the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman to the south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, much of its surface water is limited. The Caspian Sea's water is brackish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, and while the southern basin has nearly half of Iran's renewable water resources, it covers only a quarter of the land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Large mountains facing these bodies of water receive snow that melts, creating several large rivers, but most are seasonal, flowing heavily in spring and drying up in summer, with the exception of the Karun River <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Most of Iran's 10 lakes are also very salty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, resulting in less than 1% of Iran's 1.6 million square kilometers being surface water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Ancient Water Management: The Qanat System

Iran's arid conditions are not new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The first civilizations, around 1250 BC, settled in the relatively water-rich Southwest and Northwest regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Settling deeper into the arid center required sophisticated water management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Around 3,000 years ago, ancient Persians pioneered the **Qanat** system, a sophisticated water supply method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. A Qanat is a gently downward-sloping underground tunnel that transports snowmelt water from mountains to plains, sometimes spanning tens of kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. These systems relied purely on gravity, functioning automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Being underground, the water remained cool and did not evaporate, and flow could be damned and stored when not needed for irrigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

The knowledge for building Qanats was highly sophisticated and passed down through generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Their success facilitated the spread of settlements and enabled the Achaemenid Empire (550 to 330 BC) to become the largest known empire of its time, despite not being near major rivers like the Yangtze or Euphrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The engineering discipline of Qanats continued to develop, with one of the oldest hydrogeology books, "The Extraction of Hidden Waters" by Persian scientist and engineer Muhammad al-Karaji, written over a thousand years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

When Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar relocated the capital to Tehran in 1786, over 500 Qanats were built in the following two centuries to supply the city, which had little access to surface water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Overall, Iran constructed over 270,000 kilometers of underground tunnels using Qanats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Modernization and Decline of Qanats (Pahlavi Era)

By the 1900s, Iran's population growth surpassed the Qanat system's capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. After World War I, Reza Shah Pahlavi's government pursued modernization, settling nomadic populations into villages, which created new demands for consistent water supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. With limited surface water, Iran turned to hydraulic mega-projects like dams and irrigation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

The first modern water well was built in 1915 and quickly gained popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Drilling a well and using an electrically powered pump for groundwater was much faster and less labor-intensive than building Qanats, which could take up to 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Authorities promoted these modern systems, leading to the decline of Qanats. By 1950, Qanats supplied only 50% of the country's water, down from 75% in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

In 1963, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi implemented the "White Revolution," a land reform scheme intended to transfer 50% of agricultural lands from landlords to peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This reform profoundly impacted Qanats, as landlords, who previously maintained them, no longer did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. The newly established Iranian Ministry of Water and Power (1964) did not prioritize Qanat maintenance, leading many to fall into disrepair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. By 2000, Qanats accounted for less than 10% of Iran's water supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

To irrigate its largely arid, rocky, and desert-covered land (only 10.5% arable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, the government built dams and pumped groundwater. Nineteen new dam projects were initiated, with 14 completed before 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This industrial-level water management expanded irrigated lands from 8,000 square kilometers in 1968 to 22,662 square kilometers in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. However, this policy, borrowed from American development of its dry Western half, led to similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Signs of [[groundwater_overextraction_and_its_consequences_in_iran | groundwater overextraction]] emerged, leading parliament to pass laws in 1966 to ban drilling and over-pumping, though enforcement was limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The land reform itself faced issues, contributing to social instabilities that paved the way for the Islamic Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Post-Islamic Revolution Challenges and Current Water Management

Following the Islamic Revolution, Iran faced trade restrictions, prompting a drive for food self-sufficiency, which became a national security imperative during the Iran-Iraq War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. The revolution also ushered in rapid population growth; Iran's population quadrupled since 1960 and doubled in the past 20 years, reaching 88.5 million in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. To support this population and maintain self-sufficiency, Crop Production grew 175% from 1980 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

Agriculture accounts for 93% of Iran's water use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. The government heavily subsidized water and fertilizer costs and guaranteed food purchase prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. This nearly free water has encouraged inefficient use, with average irrigation efficiency under 35%, largely due to surface irrigation, where substantial water is lost to evaporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. This inefficiency has contributed to agriculture's declining share of the country's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Despite these efforts, Iran is still not completely food self-sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Reforms to improve farming efficiency are challenged by the fact that agriculture employs 23% of Iran's population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

### Decentralized Water Management

After the Islamic Revolution, Water Resource Management Affairs devolved from a single centralized body to multiple entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>:
*   **Ministry of Health and Medical Education:** Sets drinking water quality standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Energy:** Allocates water for domestic, industrial, and agricultural use, and regulates wastewater and hydropower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This was formerly the Ministry of Water and Power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Agriculture Jihad:** Allocates water among farmers and collects water fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Formed in 2001 by a merger, its construction arm (Ministry of Construction Jihad) built water infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   **Department of Environment:** Controls water pollution, prepares policies, and assesses hydropower and irrigation projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

This [[decentralization_of_water_supplies | divided management situation]] prevents an integrated approach to water supply issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

### Supply-Side Solutions and Environmental Impact

In recent decades, the Iranian government has focused on increasing water supply rather than cutting demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Iran has become one of the world's biggest dam-building countries, with over 588 dams currently and about 100 more under construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. However, damning is controversial due to its widespread [[environmental_impact_of_irans_dam_and_agricultural_projects | environmental effects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. For example, the Upper Gotvand Dam, completed in 2012, has accumulated over 66.5 million tons of salt in its reservoir, raising salinity levels in surrounding agricultural soils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

To meet rising urban water demand, the government is building desalination plants on the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. However, transporting this water to central mega-cities is expensive, and using desalinated water for agriculture is not economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

Agricultural demand and increasing development have severely drained Iran's surface water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Lake Urmia, once Iran's largest lake, has aggressively shrunk due to persistent drought and water mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. A bridge project completed in the early 2000s further exacerbated its shrinkage by cutting the lake in half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Today, the lake is a tenth of its former size, and its dry bed causes huge salt storms that ruin nearby farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Similarly, Hamoun Lake in Eastern Iran, a crucial freshwater body for 5,000 years, completely vanished during a drought in 2001, leading to dust storms and the evacuation of 124 surrounding villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

### [[groundwater_overextraction_and_its_consequences_in_iran | Groundwater Overextraction]]

Groundwater has rapidly become Iran's primary water source, accounting for 55% of the total supply in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. A 2021 Nature study estimated that over 74 cubic kilometers of water were extracted from Iran's wells between 2002 and 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Despite regulations, there is little enforcement of laws governing well drilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. The number of wells increased from 47,000 in 1979 to 789,000 in 2013, with almost all being illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

As more groundwater is withdrawn, the water table declines, forcing people to drill deeper, especially during serious droughts, which will intensify with [[effects_of_climate_change_and_drought_on_irans_water_resources | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Consequences include:
*   **Increased Salinity:** Soil and groundwater become saltier; for example, electrical conductivity measurements in the Karkheh Basin (a major agricultural area) are 85% higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
*   **Land Subsidence:** Declining groundwater levels cause the ground to literally sink, averaging about six centimeters a year, with some areas reaching 19 centimeters annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. This damages infrastructure like transmission lines, bridges, and buildings, and undermines structural safety during earthquakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
*   **Permanent Aquifer Damage:** Subsidence can permanently damage an aquifer's capacity to hold water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

While Iran's massive population contributes to less renewable water per person, the core of Iran's water crisis lies in demand and mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. [[Challenges and reforms needed in Irans water management system | Difficult decisions regarding water usage]] in homes, industry, and especially farms are necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. Long-term reforms are crucial to address the heavy costs of current water mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

At its peak, China's [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] oversaw an estimated $170 billion in global assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This conglomerate rapidly acquired major stakes in diverse companies, including Deutsche Bank and Hilton Hotels, owning airports and real estate in Germany, China, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It also built the world's third-largest aircraft leasing business, with over 900 planes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Most of these acquisitions were made in just a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. By May 2017, the company was executing at least one multi-million or billion-dollar transaction monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, this rapid expansion was largely fueled by debt, leading to one of the most significant corporate implosions in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Early Debt Strategies and Growth
The early history of [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] is characterized by opaque ownership and creative financing. When Hainan Provincial Airlines (the precursor to [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]]) was established, the Hainan government contributed 10 million RMB (about $1.4 million) as startup capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This sum was insufficient to operate an airline or even purchase a single plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

To secure more funding, co-founder Chen Feng and his colleagues convinced the local government to restructure the business as a joint-stock company, allowing private individuals to invest in the state-owned enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. In 1993, the company sold shares, raising 250 million RMB (approximately $35 million) from 122 stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### "One Plane, Two Mortgage" Approach
Despite the initial fundraising, the amount was still considered "chump change" in the airline industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Chen Feng and his team then secured an additional 600 million RMB ($84 million) from banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This was achieved through a unique debt management strategy:
*   **Initial Mortgage:** Early Chinese banks, unfamiliar with Western mortgage practices, would assign property rights of a plane to the borrower [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] when lending money for its purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Re-mortgaging:** This allowed [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] to re-mortgage the same purchased plane to another bank for even more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Future Revenue Streams:** Even after Chinese banks became aware of this tactic, [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] continued its creative borrowing by securing loans against the future revenue streams from a plane's air routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

This "one plane, two mortgage" approach allowed [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] to "double dip their leverage" and grow very rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. With long-term loan terms (10-15 years) for planes, [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] had time to figure out repayments, often by taking out new loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Financial Crises and Government Intervention
[[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] faced significant financial challenges during major economic downturns:

*   **SARS Epidemic (2003):** The SARS epidemic severely impacted the air and travel business, leading to a massive loss of 1.5 billion RMB for [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]], which was already financially stretched from earlier acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. The company nearly went bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. The Hainan provincial government, despite having a relatively small financial stake, injected 1.5 billion RMB in 2005 (10% of its entire revenue that year), effectively saving the airline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Global Financial Crisis (2008):** The 2008 global financial crisis caused [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] to incur a 1.73 billion RMB loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The company attempted to raise funds by IPOing its airline subsidiary, Grand Air China, on the Hong Kong stock markets, but market conditions made this infeasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

The company survived this crisis due to two main factors:
1.  **Government Injection:** The Hainan provincial government injected another 1.5 billion RMB into the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
2.  **Land Appreciation:** The Chinese government's 4 trillion RMB stimulus package in November 2008, which included new infrastructure projects, caused land prices nationwide to skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] benefited from this, holding onto 9,000 acres of land in Haikou (acquired when it bought Haikou Airport), which became immensely valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. This land development allowed [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] to sell 4 billion RMB of bonds and 2.8 billion RMB of stock, ending its immediate crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### Inter-subsidiary Asset Transfers
[[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] also recovered by moving company assets between subsidiaries at favorable prices to generate paper profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. For example, in 2004-2005, two [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] subsidiaries invested 600 million RMB to build their HQ, the Kohang building in Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. At the end of 2007, they transferred the building to [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] at cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. A year later, [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] sold a 95% stake in the building back to Hainan Airlines for about 1.7 billion RMB, recording a profit of approximately 1.1 billion RMB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

## The Super X Plan and Debt-Fueled Acquisition Frenzy
Despite two close calls with bankruptcy, [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] chose to expand aggressively, viewing the post-financial crisis recession as an opportunity for cheap overseas acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. This led to the "Super X Plan," aiming to accumulate 1 trillion RMB ($148 billion) of assets within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

From late 2010 to 2017, [[HNA Groups Acquisition Strategy and Its Consequences|HNA Group]] spent billions of dollars on hotel brands, technology companies, real estate, and airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. The peak of this frenzy was between 2015 and 2017, with $50 billion spent on 123 acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

### Funding the Frenzy: Debt and Opaque Structures
The vast majority of the money for these high-priced acquisitions was borrowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>:

*   **Land and Land Development:** [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] shifted from mortgaging plane assets to mortgaging land development projects and other hard assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. They partnered with indebted provincial and city governments on infrastructure projects, leasing them assets to help them circumvent debt limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. These projects were spun off into publicly traded subsidiaries, whose skyrocketing net asset values and stock prices allowed [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] management to pledge shares for even more loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>.
*   **Complex Capital Structure:** Early on, [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] evolved into a complex, intertwined web of China-based investment entities, including 10 publicly traded companies on the Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets and seven on the Hong Kong markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. As [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] acquired companies or stakes, they would inject these acquisitions into their web and then re-mortgage them for more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. The ownership and debt links were so complicated it was difficult to discern who owned what <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. This structure was likened to a "Portuguese man-of-war" â€“ an agglomeration of smaller entities entirely dependent on external currents for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

## The Beginning of the End (2017)
The acquisition frenzy and opaque debt structures drew regulatory attention.
*   **Government Scrutiny:** On June 22, 2017, the China Banking Regulatory Commission ordered several banks to conduct risk checks on the overseas borrowing and investing of [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] and other conglomerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.
*   **Banks Withdrawing Support:** By July 2017, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, and Bank of America stopped accepting shares of [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] companies as pledges for new loans, with Goldman Sachs following suit in September 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also requested information on [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]]'s financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.
*   **Rising Interest Rates:** In November 2017, [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] issued $300 million in 363-day dollar bonds at an extremely high interest rate of 8.875%, the highest ever for its class in China, indicating rising yields on [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   **Erosion of Confidence:** The Chinese central government criticized [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]]'s Sanya new airport reclamation project for "suspected illegal use of the sea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. This public criticism shook confidence in the company's presumed [[Impact of government relationships on HNA Group|government connections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.
*   **Debt Disclosure:** In late November 2017, [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] reported an estimated current loan balance of 637 billion RMB ($94 billion USD), a 36% increase from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. Including unlisted subsidiaries, estimates reached 1 trillion RMB ($148 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. This made [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] Asia's most indebted company, leading to rapid downgrades by credit rating agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.

## Asset Sales and Bankruptcy
January 2018 marked the beginning of [[HNA Groups Bankruptcy and Asset Liquidation|HNA Group]]'s reversal. Management informed creditors that the company would unwind its massive buildup and return to its core airline business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>, pledging to sell 100 billion RMB of assets in the first half of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

*   **Share Suspensions:** A third of [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]]'s publicly traded affiliates, including its tourism, leasing (Bohai Leasing), shipping/logistics (Tianjin Tianhai, which owned Ingram Micro), airline (Hainan Airlines Holdings), and retail (CCop Group) businesses, had their shares suspended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>. For some, [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] had pledged up to 60% of their total circulating shares for loans, a key source of cash for the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:29">[00:27:29]</a>.
*   **Rapid Sell-Off:** Throughout 2018, [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] began divesting assets acquired just a year earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.
    *   Two plots from the Kai Tak Airport site in Hong Kong were sold for $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.
    *   Stakes in Deutsche Bank were sold off, a process that continued into 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
    *   Swissport was swapped to its senior creditors in August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
    *   The Ingram Micro IT subsidiary was sold to Platinum Equity in December 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.

Despite these efforts, the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]]'s core airline and travel businesses sparked a final crisis that the company could not overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

### Bankruptcy Filing
On February 2021, [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] finally entered [[HNA Groups Bankruptcy and Asset Liquidation|bankruptcy proceedings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. The company acknowledged $170 billion in debts from creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. The company is expected to be split into four businesses after the bankruptcy procedures are completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. In September 2021, co-founder Chen Feng and his chief executive, Adam Tan, were detained by the Chinese government for suspected crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.

## Conclusion
The rise and fall of [[Rise and Fall of Chinas HNA Group|HNA Group]] was held together by "mountains of debt" and the "unspoken implication of close government involvement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. While some believed the company had government backing, its "incredibly complex structure" may have existed to "dodge oversight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>, a strategy that ultimately failed when the financial currents turned.

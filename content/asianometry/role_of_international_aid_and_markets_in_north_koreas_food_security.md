North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), has long pursued [[north_koreas_agricultural_selfsufficiency_efforts | self-sufficiency in food production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, reliable information about the country's food situation is difficult to obtain, as official channels are often not credible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This article parses available information on North Korea's agricultural instability and the role of international aid and emergent markets in addressing its food security challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Historical Challenges and External Dependencies

Historically, the northern part of Korea was its industrial heartland, while the south served as its breadbasket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. At its founding, the DPRK inherited an industrialized society from the Japanese occupation government, possessing 72% of the peninsula's industrial capacity and over 90% of its hydroelectric capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Land belonging to Korean landlords and Japanese colonialists was seized and redistributed to the peasantry in 1945-1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

However, the Korean War (1950-1953) devastated the peninsula, causing immense population upheaval and annihilating industrial infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. After the war, the DPRK turned to its major communist neighbors, China and the Soviet Union, for aid and guidance in rebuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. North Korea leveraged the deteriorating Sino-Soviet relations to extract maximum concessions from both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

Domestically, North Korea adopted an orthodox centrally planned economy, suppressing markets, with the state owning all businesses and providing all jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The state seized all land, establishing cooperatives and state farms, with all food grown confiscated for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Eternal Leader Kim Il-sung pushed for this collectivization to achieve [[north_koreas_agricultural_selfsufficiency_efforts | food self-reliance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. This collectivization drive, criticized even by communist bloc peers, led to food shortages in the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. In response, the government promoted heavy use of fertilizers, pesticides, tractors, and irrigation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. While yields stabilized, the agricultural sector became dangerously dependent on raw inputs like oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## The Great Famine of the 1990s and International Aid

Over the years, North Korea accumulated vast debts to the Soviet Union and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. These unpaid debts led to the Soviets withdrawing various subsidies in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 caused North Korea to lose its main source of coal, oil, and steel, which had accounted for up to two-thirds of its two-way trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The loss of oil severely impacted their ability to produce fertilizers and run irrigation infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

The DPRK then turned to China for compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. By 1993, China supplied North Korea with 77% of its fuel and 68% of its food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. However, in 1994, China faced its own grain issues, became disillusioned with its North Korean relations, and cut back on this trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

North Korean radio broadcasts began admitting the existence of hunger in 1994, though simultaneously denying its seriousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Studies of mortality rates imply that famine conditions had already begun in certain provinces by 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Rations were delayed or suspended in some provinces in 1993, and by 1994, the government ceased food shipments to four provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. In 1995, coercive seizures of grain from farms began, and prison camps were established for those caught foraging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Refugees from hard-hit provinces poured into China, leading to horrific media reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

In 1995 and 1996, the country's four western provinces, where most farms are located, experienced severe flooding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The North Korean government claimed 5 million people were displaced, over 1 million tons of grain lost, and $15 billion in damages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. While the floods were bad, the government likely exaggerated the damage, as food shortages existed before the floods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. For instance, a UN survey counted only 500,000 displaced people, not 5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Exaggerating the damage allowed the government to save face while requesting aid from South Korea or Japan, and deflected criticism of the political regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

International food aid did help, but not all of it reached those most in need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Many charitable organizations eventually withdrew from North Korea due to disputes and a lack of accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. The exact scale of the famine, including the number of deaths (estimates range from 220,000 to 3.5 million), and its start and end dates, remain uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Emergence of Private Markets

During the great famine, the old state food rationing system collapsed due to oil shortages hindering food distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This forced ordinary North Koreans to resort to illegal private markets for food access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. These "black markets" were largely run by women (housewives) selling goods to keep their families alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

After the famine subsided, the government initially attempted to crack down on these markets but eventually formalized them, providing housing, facilities, and even security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Although the government refused to call it "market reform," that is essentially what it was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Today, defector surveys indicate that most ordinary North Koreans get their food from these markets, as well as from private plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

The government has also tried to revitalize the old food ration system, but its current extent is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. While defectors report no longer receiving rations, the state still takes up to 70% of state farmers' annual harvests for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. It is speculated that these rations now primarily go to the country's political and economic elites to maintain their support for the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

## Current State of International Aid and Market Influence

Agricultural production has improved since the 1990s, partly due to international aid, favorable weather, and [[north_korean_economic_and_agricultural_reforms | economic reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Much of what is known about North Korea's current agricultural situation comes from international aid programs operating in the country since at least 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

After the famine, the government permitted households to own and cultivate private plots, where people grow potatoes, corn, and vegetables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. These privately-owned plots are well-cared for and have significantly contributed to improving the country's food security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

In 2012, the Kim Jong-un government implemented economic policy changes to devolve more authority to lower levels, allowing workers on collective farms to make more decisions regarding material and investment planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. While this is not as extensive as China's agricultural reforms under Deng Xiaoping, it marks a step forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. However, the extent and impact of these reforms on the bottom line remain uncertain due to the lack of transparent statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

Despite these changes, North Korean farmers continue to face challenges. The lack of adequate farming technology, such as tractors suited for the country's irregular fields, and the inability to run or maintain existing technology due to energy or parts shortages, hinder efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. The country's inability to raise funds for these items is a major factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. North Korea blames US trade sanctions (e.g., Export Control Act, Trading with the Enemy Act), though these laws predated North Korea's existence and restrictions were removed in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Furthermore, China and the Soviet Union, who were hardly American allies, also reduced support due to North Korea's history as a "notorious deadbeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

Kim Jong-un has repeatedly stated his desire to improve people's lives through increased food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. However, his government has been short on concrete policy solutions, often offering vague proposals like a "seed revolution" or repeating past strategies like double cropping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. While food distribution has improved and famine is no longer a major threat, North Korea's food situation still falls short of [[north_koreas_agricultural_selfsufficiency_efforts | self-sufficiency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. The country's farms have suffered from significant soil damage over decades, and current proposals are unlikely to address the fundamental agricultural issues needed for people to have enough food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

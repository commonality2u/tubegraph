By 1986, the Soviet Union possessed just over 10,000 computers, while the United States had 1.3 million [00:00:01]. At the time of Stalin's death, the Soviet Union was considered the world's third most proficient computing power [00:00:10]. However, by the 1960s, the computing gap between the U.S. and the Soviet Union was already years long, becoming undeniable and effectively permanent twenty years later [00:00:17]. Despite the Soviet state's belief in science and industrial modernization, and significant support for research and development in hard sciences, their computing industry lagged [00:00:28].

## Early Soviet Computer Development

In 1948, news reached the Soviet Union about the ENIAC, the first general-purpose programmable computer, which had been built two years earlier in the United States [00:00:44]. Although the Soviets knew little about ENIAC beyond its use of vacuum tubes, and some dismissed it as propaganda, they noted the West's investment in the field [00:00:54].

The Soviet government recognized the need to improve calculating workflows. For instance, the [[impact_of_nuclear_weapons_on_cold_war_dynamics | nuclear weapons]] program required over 100 young women to perform daily eight-hour shifts solely dedicated to calculations, often involving complex differential equations [00:01:10]. Administrators were concerned about finding enough personnel for error-free calculations [00:01:24].

In 1948, the Soviet Union established the Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Technology (ITMVT) within the Soviet Academy of Sciences to explore computing [00:01:39]. However, the ITMVT's initial efforts were directed towards mechanical analog calculating machines due to the political influence of its director, General Nikolai Brevich [00:01:52]. Brevich believed that reliable electronic general-purpose computers were impossible in the near future [00:02:00]. While many Soviet scientists disagreed, expressing dissent during the Stalin era was dangerous [00:02:10].

### Sergey Lebedev and the MESM

A new development in Ukraine offered an alternative path [00:02:22]. In 1948, Sergey Lebedev, director of the Kiev Electrotechnical Institute, learned about American efforts to build digital computers [00:02:26]. Lebedev, a trained electrical engineer and World War II hero, recognized the importance of computers for his country [00:02:36]. Over the next two years, he built his own "little calculating machine," the Mali Electrono Machina (MESM) [00:02:54]. Ironically named, the MESM comprised about 6,000 vacuum tubes and occupied 60 square meters of space [00:03:04].

In December 1951, the MESM solved its first real calculation, determining 585 possible values of a probability distribution function for an artillery weapons calculation table [00:03:12]. This task required 250,000 calculations and two and a half hours [00:03:22].

### Rise of BESM-1 and Bureaucratic Challenges

In late 1949, the MESM was demonstrated to top political leaders, including future Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, then Secretary of the Ukrainian Communist Party [00:03:30]. The demonstration reportedly impressed Khrushchev [00:03:40]. Renegade scientists at the ITMVT reached out to Khrushchev, who authorized the removal of Nikolai Brevich, allowing ITMVT to proceed with a new, more powerful digital computer [00:03:43].

This new machine was the Bolshaya Electrono Machina (BESM-1), meaning "large calculating machine" [00:03:57]. It was capable of 8,000 to 10,000 operations per second (8-10 kiloflops) [00:04:03]. The BESM-1 would have been one of the world's fastest computers, and certainly the fastest in Europe [00:04:12]. For comparison, in 1951, America's leading-edge UNIVAC I was capable of only about 1 kiloflop [00:04:16].

However, ITMVT faced difficulties delivering the BESM-1 due to [[impact_of_bureaucratic_infighting_on_soviet_technological_advancements | bureaucratic infighting]] [00:04:26]. The Ministry of Machine and Instrument Engineering had established a new institute, SKB245, for creating differential analyzers (mechanical analog computers) [00:04:31]. SKB245, however, soon deviated from its mandate and proposed building its own digital high-speed computer, the Strela [00:04:49]. The Strela was computationally inferior to the BESM-1, performing only 2 kiloflops compared to BESM-1's 8-10 [00:04:57]. Despite this, its proponents argued that its performance was sufficient [00:05:04].

With Stalin's approval, the two institutes competed, hindering the BESM-1's development [00:05:20]. Near completion, ITMVT needed special cathode ray tubes for memory storage, but the only ministry producing them was SKB245's [00:05:26]. This ministry refused to supply the tubes for the BESM-1, forcing the team to adopt inferior mercury storage tubes [00:05:44].

In 1951, a state commission selected the Strela over the BESM-1 [00:05:52]. However, users quickly discovered serious issues with the Strela: it broke down frequently and could not solve the complex quadratic equations required for fission development [00:06:00]. This critical requirement led the head of the Soviet [[impact_of_nuclear_weapons_on_cold_war_dynamics | nuclear development]] effort to request BESM-1 replacements by 1955 [00:06:13]. The BESM-1 remained Europe's fastest computer for a few more years, but this struggle foreshadowed future issues in building a competitive Soviet computer industry [00:06:21].

## The Widening Production Gap

While the Soviets successfully developed a first-generation computer as quickly as the West, and arguably a better one, the story at the production level was vastly different [00:06:31].

### Production Disparity

In 1959, the Soviet Union produced computers worth a cumulative $59 million [00:06:53]. In the same year, the United States produced $1 billion of computer hardware [00:07:01]. By 1964, the Soviet Union produced 200 million semiconductor pieces, a significant improvement but still far behind the 1.36 billion produced by the United States [00:07:06]. This production disparity, rather than ideological differences, proved to be a decisive factor in the [[comparison_between_souviet_and_american_computing_advancements | Soviet computing industry's]] failure [00:07:19].

### [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Challenges of the Soviet Command Economy]]

The [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Soviet command economy]] prevented computers from reaching their full potential [00:07:34]. While the Soviet military had some demand, it was limited [00:07:38]. In the West, computer-aided automation revolutionized industrial processes like steel-making and manufacturing, driving massive commercial and industrial demand for computers far exceeding military needs [00:07:43].

However, a Soviet steelmaker only needed to meet their quota, with no emphasis on steel quality or production efficiency [00:07:57]. This meant Soviet computer makers had little incentive to produce productivity-improving computers or to provide necessary training and customer service [00:08:08]. As a result, ministers were reluctant to allocate limited resources to computer development, fearing it might jeopardize their quotas [00:08:22]. Consequently, factories frequently lacked the funding, materials, and talent needed for production [00:08:30]. For example, in 1958, the Penza Computer and Analytical Machine Plant, one of only two in the Soviet Union at the time, requested 50 computer experts but received only seven [00:08:37].

This was a systemic issue, as the country had historically struggled to distribute new revolutionary technologies across its economy [00:08:49]. For instance, despite pioneering steel-making and synthetic fibers, the Soviets lagged behind foreign peers in implementing these innovations domestically [00:08:58].

## Second Generation Computers: The Transistor Era

In 1959, the West began a transition from vacuum tubes to [[impact_of_the_transistor_on_technology | transistors]], ushering in second-generation computer technology [00:09:16]. The transistor's solid-state reliability and smaller size transformed computers from scientific curiosities into powerful industrial tools [00:09:25]. The IBM 1401, dubbed the "Model T of computers," sold over 12,000 units, replacing older punch card technologies and spurring the development of new peripherals (like cathode ray displays and external storage) and programming paradigms [00:09:33].

The Soviets also worked to develop their own second-generation computers [00:09:53]. The Ural series, built by the Penza computer plant, were notable for their unified nature [00:09:57]. The true Soviet second-generation flagship was the BESM-6 [00:10:05]. Entering production in 1967, the BESM-6 was the Soviet Union's first supercomputer, capable of over a million operations per second [00:10:08]. Its widespread adoption across computing centers led to the development of new software and multi-program operating systems [00:10:21]. This represented significant progress, but by then, Americans were already advancing to the next technological phase [00:10:28].

The Soviets managed to deliver first and second-generation computers only two or so years behind the West, a manageable gap [00:10:34].

## Third Generation and the Permanent Gap: Integrated Circuits

The landscape changed dramatically with third-generation computers, powered by integrated circuits [00:10:43]. This is where the first mentions of a significant [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | computing gap]] between the United States and the Soviet Union emerged [00:10:48].

### The IBM System/360 and the Soviet Response

In 1964, IBM announced the System/360, a complete line of computer hardware with both backward and forward compatibility [00:10:54]. This revolutionized the computer industry by allowing customers to preserve investments in expensive software when upgrading [00:11:12]. It became one of IBM's greatest commercial successes [00:11:14]. In the Soviet Union, it became clear that future demand for computers had a seemingly limitless ceiling, and the disjointed domestic industry needed to adapt [00:11:18].

Public criticism began to mount. In 1964, Izvestia, a leading Soviet newspaper, published the first major criticism of the country's computer efforts, highlighting the industry's fragmentation and calling for centralization [00:11:29]. Two years later, Pravda questioned the industry's readiness to meet national computing requirements, stating, "Unfortunately, we must state that the situation is far from optimistic" [00:11:44].

### The Decision to Copy: ES Project

The Soviet Union had a history of importing foreign technologies, from Peter the Great's era to acquiring expertise in rocketry from German scientists post-WWII [00:11:59]. While this often helped acquire expertise and sometimes led to market dominance (e.g., China in solar panels, Japan/Taiwan/South Korea in semiconductors), there was a risk of becoming irreversibly dependent if innovation could not be self-generated [00:12:24].

In 1967, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued Decree Resolution 1184-20 to consolidate its computing industry [00:12:52]. The goal was to produce the ES (Anonymous Systema or Unified System) series of unified third-generation computers [00:13:00]. The resolution dramatically increased the computing manufacturing budget tenfold to 3 billion rubles by 1975, calling for 28 new computer plants, expansion of 22 existing ones, and production of 20,000 computers by 1975 [00:13:14].

To build the ES, the ministries in charge opted to copy the design of an American IBM 360 model to ensure compatibility with 360 software [00:13:31]. This decision was highly controversial [00:13:41]. Some argued it would make the USSR an "intellectual colony of the West," while influential scientists believed it was an opportunity to pioneer a new Soviet computing experience [00:13:44]. One memo warned:
> "Copying foreign work excludes the possibility of utilizing our own collective experience of computer research and in the immediate future will hinder our ability to employ new principles. This will bring the development of computer technology in our nation to an end." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>

This assessment proved largely correct [00:14:16]. Furthermore, the US government forbade IBM from exporting 360 systems to the Soviet Union, meaning the Soviets had to acquire genuine systems through espionage or intermediaries for documentation [00:14:21].

Alternative options existed. ICL, the United Kingdom's largest computer maker, offered to share technology and documentation from their 360-compatible System 4 line of computers [00:14:38]. ICL was even willing to commit funds and specialists for future code development [00:14:56]. This promising alternative would have provided 360 software compatibility, allowed learning British programming methods, and retained some industrial sovereignty [00:15:13]. However, working with ICL would delay the project by at least one and a half years [00:15:23]. Such a delay was politically unpalatable given the already wide [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | Soviet-American computer gap]], especially in software [00:15:29]. The domestic situation was so dire that even Brezhnev was aware of it, making missed deadlines politically risky [00:15:39]. Moreover, East Germany had already begun copying the IBM 360, and a change in direction would have caused political friction [00:15:52].

The decision to copy the IBM 360 had tragic and long-lasting consequences for the [[soviet_computer_development_history | Soviet computing industry]] [00:16:05]. Several prominent computer scientists resigned in protest [00:16:13]. Sergey Lebedev's attempts to reverse the decision reportedly hastened his death in 1974 [00:16:18].

### Outcomes of the ES Project

Over 100 organizations, 46,000 scientists, and 300,000 workers across Poland, East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Czechoslovakia collaborated to develop the ES [00:16:28]. Over 15,000 ES pieces were created, with much of the hardware reverse-engineered [00:16:40]. However, peripherals, particularly disk storage solutions, fell short of Western alternatives [00:16:47].

Software-wise, the ES's 360 compatibility did accelerate Soviet capabilities [00:16:58]. Contemporary CIA estimates in the 1970s suggested the [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | Soviet computing gap]] shrank from 10-15 years in the mid-1960s to about 4-6 years [00:17:03]. However, this short-term gain led to a long-term loss [00:17:14]. Starting in the 1980s, the Soviet industry struggled to reverse-engineer increasingly complex Western computers, widening the gap once more [00:17:19]. The Soviets had lost the native industrial capacity to develop anything new on their own, making the gap permanent [00:17:28].

Industrial productivity suffered as computers from the 1970s aged and frequently broke down [00:17:36]. By 1989, a quarter of the Soviet Union's 13,613 general-purpose computers were ES-1022s, made in 1974 but based on technology first released in 1965 – making them 24 years old [00:17:41]. The reliance on foreign technology also caused issues when the United States and the West imposed export bans on advanced technologies during international crises [00:17:57].

In the United States, policymakers debated whether to allow Soviets access to American technologies [00:18:08]. Hawks argued it would help the Soviets close the gap, and in some ways they were correct, as the Soviets, with their human capital shortages, could never have created anything close to the IBM 360 software [00:18:14]. However, even with the transfers, the gap persisted, and the Soviets never fully closed it [00:18:30].

The decline of the [[soviet_computer_development_history | Soviet computing industry]] is a story of wasted talents, lost progress, foolish short-term strategic choices made by politicians over scientists, and the inherent limits of centralized planning [00:18:36].

[[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Seymour Cray]]'s lifelong quest was to create the biggest supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. While at Control Data Corporation, when asked his five and one-year goals, he stated:
> Five-year goal: Build the biggest computer in the world. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>
> One-year goal: One-fifth of the above. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>

This singular focus defined his career.

## Founding Cray Research

In 1971, [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Seymour Cray]] was working on the 8600 supercomputer for Control Data (CDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. He encountered significant challenges, particularly with cooling due to the dense component layout required for an 8-nanosecond clock cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. True to his style, the "Cray way" meant throwing everything out and starting from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. However, Control Data was engaged in an expensive antitrust lawsuit against IBM, and cash flow was low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. When asked to cut expenses, [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Cray]] responded by cutting his own salary to minimum wage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Ultimately, CDC management informed him a redo was not possible as two 8600 systems had already been pre-sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

In 1972, [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Cray]] decided to leave CDC and establish his own company, Cray Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. He founded it with $2.5 million, 20% of which was his personal funds, supplemented by bank loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. The company's mission was to build the biggest computer, one at a time, focusing on research over mass manufacture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. In a gesture of goodwill, William Norris and Control Data invested a quarter-million dollars into the new venture, a sum Norris called "heart money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

## Development of the Cray-1

For his initial computer, the Cray-1, [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Seymour Cray]] aimed for revolutionary performance, turning to a new concept: vector processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. Unlike most contemporary CPUs that used scalar processing (handling single data items one at a time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>, vector processing machines could process single-dimension arrays of data (vectors) more efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. For example, adding two sets of twenty numbers would require 80 instructions for a scalar CPU but only 4 for a vector machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

Control Data had explored vector processing with their STAR-100, but it was overly complicated and failed to meet expectations, shipping four years late and selling only three units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Cray]] identified its flaws: slow scalar processing bottlenecking overall system performance and high memory latency for vector operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

To address these issues, [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Cray]] introduced "vector registers"—fast intermediate memory systems that functioned like cache memory to enhance speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. He also adopted integrated circuits (ICs) for the first time, which increased density and reduced wiring, making the Cray-1 significantly smaller than its predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. While ICs were mature by then (about 14 years old), [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Cray]] preferred using older, more reliable technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. However, for memory, he made an exception, using bipolar semiconductor memory chips to replace older core memory for better cost, density, and power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

The Cray-1 achieved a clock cycle of 12.5 nanoseconds, making it five times faster than the CDC 7600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. This extreme speed necessitated that every wire in the machine be shorter than four feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. Its iconic circular shape was designed to accommodate the new cooling scheme, with an added flair to distinguish it from the "boring gray boxes of the era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. It even included cushions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

## Impact and Success of the Cray-1

Upon its release in 1976, the Cray-1 generated significant excitement due to its distinctive appearance and world-leading speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. Approximately one hundred Cray-1 units were sold to various government agencies and university laboratories, including the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the Department of Defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.

Cray Research experienced remarkable revenue growth, with 150% growth from 1978 to 1979, and another 50% the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. Orders came in rapidly—one per month, which was substantial for an $8 million product—leading to a significant backlog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. IBM did not even attempt to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Cray]]'s former employer, Control Data, struggled to keep pace, producing vector computers like the Cyber-205 but suffering from bloat and complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. CDC eventually experienced large financial losses and sold off its assets, with its most profitable business by the mid-1980s becoming Ticketron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.

Despite the high cost of each Cray-1 ($8 million, or about $23 million today) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, which limited the market to roughly 50 global customers, [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Cray]] viewed this as a feature, appreciating being able to know his customers by first name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

## Challenges of Success

Even as the Cray-1 neared completion, [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Seymour Cray]] began contemplating an even more ambitious machine, the Cray-2, aiming for a clock speed three to six times faster than its predecessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. Such a machine presented significant obstacles, including the need for wires no longer than 40 centimeters and recurring heating challenges similar to those faced with the 8600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

However, the success of Cray Research brought new responsibilities that diverted [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Cray]] from pure design. To fund early development, Cray Research went public, leading to a new set of obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. The manual, custom-made nature of each Cray-1, a process that took a year per machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>, necessitated rapid staffing to meet the backlog. The company grew from 300 employees in 1978 to 500 in 1980, eventually employing over 5,000 people in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

## The Same Dilemma

Historically, [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Cray]] gravitated towards scientific computing because its users developed their own software, allowing him to focus solely on hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. However, times had changed; customers increasingly prioritized software portability and were reluctant to rewrite their applications for radically different architectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. This meant customers were more interested in an improved Cray-1 than a completely distinct Cray-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>, mirroring the dilemma [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Cray]] faced at Control Data regarding the 1604 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

Cray Research's management, led by CEO John Rollwagen, opted for a dual strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. They extended the Cray-1 line with the 1S, a powerful but not radically different computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. Meanwhile, [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Seymour Cray]] stepped down as Chairman in 1981, becoming an independent contractor to concentrate on the Cray-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>, moving to Boulder, Colorado, for a quieter work environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

The Cray-2 was eventually released in 1985, notable for its liquid immersion cooling system that made it resemble an aquarium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. However, memory latency hindered its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>.

To the surprise of many, the Cray-2 was overshadowed by the Cray X-MP supercomputer, developed by a separate team led by Les Davis and Steve Chen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. While the Cray-1 had a single CPU, the X-MP introduced parallel processing with four CPUs and new solid-state storage semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. Released in 1983, the X-MP became the world's fastest supercomputer, being 2-5 times faster than the 1S without the radical design changes of the Cray-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. The X-MP sold very well, with almost 200 units sold by 1989 compared to only 24 units of the Cray-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

## Later Years of Cray Research

The unexpected success of the X-MP line eventually created internal challenges for Cray Research. Designer Steve Chen's aggressive vision for future MP systems, involving 64 processors, custom integrated circuits, and potentially optical interconnects, became financially unsustainable for the company, which was already invested in the Cray-3 and Y-MP, in addition to existing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>. In 1987, Cray Research scaled back the MP line, leading to Chen's departure to start Supercomputer Systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

By 1989, Cray Research could no longer accommodate its founder's "clean sheet" design philosophy. [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Seymour Cray]] joined a spinoff called Cray Computer Corporation (CCC) in Colorado to develop the Cray-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. Cray Research continued with the existing Cray X-MP architecture and ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>. The Cray-3 aimed to use gallium arsenide semiconductors for superior switching performance, requiring significant investment in chipmaking equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. However, the project fell behind, and in 1991, defense demand cratered after the fall of the Soviet Union, leading to customer cancellations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. CCC sold only one system before filing for bankruptcy in 1995, and a planned Cray-4 never materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.

[[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Seymour Cray]]'s preferred method of "sitting down with a clean sheet of paper" to build a "big iron" supercomputer was no longer financially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. He formed a new company, SRC Computers, to explore parallel designs before his passing in 1996 from a car accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. Cray Research was eventually acquired by Silicon Graphics and is now part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as Cray Inc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.

The [[evolution_of_supercomputing_technology|advancement of semiconductor technologies]] has made past supercomputers seem primitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. In 2010, a Cray-1A supercomputer was emulated using a Xilinx Spartan-3E 1600 development board, which now resides in the Computer History Museum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. Modern semiconductor makers face similar challenges to those [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Cray]] encountered with his supercomputers, including thermal issues, interconnect problems, and memory retrieval slowdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>. However, unlike [[seymour_cray_and_the_cray_supercomputer|Cray]], the industry cannot simply "throw it all out, and start anew with a fresh sheet of paper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.

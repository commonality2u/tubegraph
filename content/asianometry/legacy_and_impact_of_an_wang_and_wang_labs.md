The story of Wang Laboratories is inextricably linked to the singular genius of its founder, An Wang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. An incredible engineer and a brilliant businessman, Wang Labs' [[history_and_rise_of_wang_labs | rise]] was propelled by An Wang's ability to create the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. His journey from a man who came from China with nothing to a billionaire, before ultimately losing it all, embodies a significant American story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The company's [[the_decline_and_fall_of_wang_labs | fall]] is regarded as an "incredibly sad" decline of a computing pioneer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## An Wang's Early Life and Intellectual Prowess

Born in Shanghai in 1920 to an upper-middle-class family, An Wang's father was an educated teacher and practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. His family frequently moved to avoid the conflict during a chaotic period in China, torn between Chiang Kai-shek's KMT party and Mao Zedong's Communist Party of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Wang started school in the third grade, always being two years younger than his classmates, due to the absence of first or second grade at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Despite this, he excelled in math and science, though not in other subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. His "unusual but quiet confidence" in his abilities drove him throughout his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. At nine, he decided to take junior high exams, placing first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. By 13, he tested into Shanghai Provincial High School (now Shanghai High School), leaving his family to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. He remained quiet, shying away from team sports but enjoying ping pong, and continued to excel in math and sciences while struggling with Chinese and English, never mastering the latter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

At 16, Wang won a scholarship to Chaotong University, then considered "China's MIT" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. During Japan's invasion of China in late 1936, the university and Wang's family fled to the French concession of Shanghai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Despite the deaths of his mother, father, and older sister under unclear circumstances, Wang graduated first in his class in 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

After graduation, Wang joined the Chinese Central Radio Corporation to build radios for the Chinese Army, working in Guilin where he often had to hide in limestone caverns to avoid Japanese bombings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. His colleagues recognized his potential, with the company president remarking, "he is very quiet but he is always thinking...he is very genius he will do something one day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. In 1944, after the Japanese overran Guilin, Wang fled to Chongqing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. He later won a government test to study in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Founding of Wang Labs and Early Innovations

Arriving in the U.S. in 1945, Wang studied Applied Physics at Harvard, finding the work easy and earning a PhD in just 13 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. He married Lorraine Chu and had three children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

After his PhD, Wang joined the Harvard Computation Lab, working on the Mark I, one of the world's most powerful computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. He focused on the problem of storing and reading large amounts of information without clumsy mechanical steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Data on magnetic tapes would demagnetize upon reading, destroying the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Wang's crucial insight, conceived while walking through Harvard Yard, was that the information could simply be rewritten immediately after reading without significant speed sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This concept was incorporated into magnetic core memory, the successor to magnetic drums and the ancestor of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

In 1949, Wang applied for a patent for this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This angered his Harvard colleagues, who believed such knowledge should be public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. With Harvard shifting away from commercial applications, Wang decided to start his own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Despite societal racism against Chinese immigrants, his challenges with English, and lack of money, Wang had unshakable confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. He named the company after himself, Wang Laboratories, founded on June 30, 1951, with just $600 in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Wang began by producing and selling core memories for about $4 each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. He did all the selling himself and reached out to IBM in 1952 to license his patent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Initially slow, he supplemented his income by teaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. His reputation grew, leading to custom consulting jobs where he would always deliver a better solution than the client's existing methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. In 1953, he struck a deal with IBM for consulting revenue and a future patent option, providing stability to hire employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

An Wang was not only a brilliant engineer but also a "sharp, very tough businessman" unafraid to confront IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. He obsessed over every detail of his company, to the point where the company and the person were indistinguishable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. However, he was also a micromanager and not a "great boss," demanding a lot from his employees and envisioning passing control to his son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

In 1955, IBM paid Wang $400,000 to $500,000 (roughly $4.4 to $5.5 million today) for his patent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Despite the good money, Wang lamented that his patent only covered a small piece of the core memory product, while IBM paid Jay Wright Forester $13 million for a more complete application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This experience made Wang harbor lasting resentment toward IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Key Products and Business Strategies

The IBM money allowed Wang to shift from consulting to product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Linusac and Lessons Learned
In the early 1960s, Wang partnered with Compugraphic to design and produce the Linusac, a machine that justified text lines for publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The Linusac was a hit, significantly increasing Wang Laboratories' revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. However, when Compugraphic started producing the machine themselves, cutting Wang out, Wang threatened an infringement lawsuit, claiming he patented the original design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This incident solidified Wang's hard-headed style and taught him "never to produce a product that he did not have full control over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Calculators: LOCI and Wang 300
Wang's first fully controlled hit came in 1964 with the calculator industry's transition to solid-state electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. He sought to create a calculator with mainframe capabilities but much smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Wang and a colleague patented a transistor logic capable of calculating natural logarithms efficiently, which led to the Logarithmic Calculating Instrument (LOCI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Debuting in January 1965, the LOCI was powerful but difficult to use, selling 10-20 units a month at $6,500 to science labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

Wang then released the Wang 300 calculator in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Costing $1,695 and easy to use, it was an immediate hit, selling to scientists, researchers, stockbrokers, and insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. The Wang 300 became famous on Wall Street for revealing a long-standing error in a bond trading table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Revenues rapidly tripled, and Wang Laboratories went public in a highly publicized IPO in 1967, making An Wang's personal stock holdings worth $50 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

### Transition to Computers and Word Processing
Wang recognized the calculator market was becoming difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. With Intel introducing its first microprocessor in 1971, he correctly predicted that calculator prices would plummet due to the [[impact_of_generational_shifts_in_the_semiconductor_industry | ability to put an entire calculator onto a single chip]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. In a "balls-y decision," Wang decided to pull out of the calculator market starting in 1971, even though calculators made up 75% of the company's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. He believed the computer was the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

His two-pronged strategy involved:
1.  **General-purpose computers**: The Wang 3300 BASIC, released in 1970, was not successful due to programming difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. However, its successor, the Wang 2200 (1973), which stored program information on Intel's ROM chips for instant wake capability, became a highly capable and affordable small business computer, selling well for a decade and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
2.  **Word processors**: Wang aimed to replace IBM's Magnetic Tape Selectric typewriter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. The initial Wang 1200 Word Processor (1971), a modified Wang 700 calculator connected to an IBM Selectric, suffered reliability problems due to improper components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

The lessons from the 1200 led to the **Wang Word Processing System (WPS)**, introduced in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Redesigned from the ground up, the WPS featured a network of powerful machines, each with its own 8080 Intel microprocessor, capable of independent work, text sharing, and central storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. It ditched the IBM Selectric for a CRT screen and simplified user experience with built-in prompts and a menu system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. The WPS was an immediate hit, pulling the company "back from the brink" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

### The VS Minicomputer
In 1977, Wang launched its third major product, the **VS minicomputer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. Smaller and cheaper than IBM's mainframes, it was powerful enough to run commercial applications without needing a large team of technicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Competing with Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX line, the VS held its own, modeled after an IBM 360 but not explicitly called such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. These three products generated billions for Wang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

## Marketing and Peak Success

By the late 1970s, Wang was the world's largest supplier of CRT-based word processing systems but remained largely unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. In 1978, the company launched a massive three-month TV ad campaign, including a 30-second Super Bowl ad costing $150,000, to position itself as a leading computer maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Despite being only the 32nd largest computer maker, Wang was one of the few advertising on TV besides IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Their "David vs. Goliath" spot directly attacked IBM, gaining significant attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. Awareness jumped from 3% to 14%, and the campaign was so successful that executives downplayed its effectiveness to discourage copycats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

Wang's revenues doubled from 1978 to 1980, and again by 1982, reaching $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. By 1984, sales hit $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. In 1983, 80% of the largest U.S. firms bought Wang equipment, with nearly half of the company's revenue coming from Fortune 500 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.

## The Decline and Fall

An Wang began to slow down after turning 60 in 1980, formally retiring in 1983 and appointing John A. Cunningham, a respected 16-year sales employee, as head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. An Wang, however, remained Chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. He had been intimately involved in product development, spending an estimated 65% of his time there, and was an "extraordinary manager" of R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>.

### The Succession Crisis
The company's [[the_decline_and_fall_of_wang_labs | turning point]] began with its products and the succession crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. An Wang intended for his sons, Fred and later Courtney, to take over Wang Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. Fred, despite being smart, lacked his father's touch for managing R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

In October 1983, Wang Labs announced 14 new products, hoping to challenge IBM, including the Wang Professional Image Computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>. The market initially reacted positively, with the stock peaking at $42.50 in 1984, making An Wang worth over $1.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. However, this marked the peak of Wang's fortunes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.

The problem was that these products were very late, some by years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Fred had rushed the announcements, damaging his credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. This was a critical time for such "vaporware" because competition was heating up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

### Missing the PC Revolution
Two years earlier, the [[impact_and_legacy_of_compaq_within_the_pc_industry | IBM PC]] had taken the world by storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. These PCs, with word processing and spreadsheet software, immediately began eroding Wang's specialized word processors and 2200 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. An Wang resisted the PC, viewing it as another "calculator" destined to become a commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. When Fred pushed the company to build their own PC, it lacked compatibility with the [[impact_and_legacy_of_compaq_within_the_pc_industry | IBM PC's]] massive software ecosystem and was "Dead on Arrival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

The company never recovered from its botched 1983 announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. Cunningham believed Fred could not manage R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. In October 1984, An Wang moved Fred to run manufacturing, overruling Cunningham's objections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. R&D continued to produce "duds," and the company expanded recklessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. An Wang also rejected potential mergers that could have shored up debt, fearing loss of family control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. While An Wang had long foreseen the future, his loyalty to his family began to lead the company astray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>.

In April 1985, Wang Labs announced a 66% quarterly profit decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. In July 1985, Cunningham resigned, selling all his stock, marking the beginning of the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. An Wang briefly took over, but in 1987, he made Fred company president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. Despite board requests to bring in a professional manager, An Wang famously refused, stating, "He is my son and he can do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

Losses mounted throughout 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. In July 1989, Wang posted a $424 million annual loss, suspended dividends, and laid off more people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. The stock crashed from $43 to $5 a share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

## An Wang's Final Days and Bankruptcy

In 1989, An Wang was diagnosed with esophageal cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. In August 1989, after surgery, he had to fire his son, Fred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. Richard Miller, a turnaround expert without computer industry experience, was appointed president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. Miller oversaw asset sales and layoffs, but the company still showed a $715.9 million loss in 1990, despite $2.5 billion in revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

Pinning Wang Labs' troubles entirely on Fred would be a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. The company's failure traces back to An Wang missing the [[impact_and_legacy_of_compaq_within_the_pc_industry | PC Revolution]], the power of office software, and the failure to find the next hit product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>. Few companies survived this [[impact_of_generational_shifts_in_the_semiconductor_industry | generational transition]], though the succession turmoil certainly exacerbated the decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.

In January 1990, the cancer returned, and Wang lost his ability to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. He finally relinquished control to Miller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. An Wang, who had not been a present father in their youth, spent his last months with his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>. He died alone on March 24, 1990, at Massachusetts General Hospital, at the age of 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. In his last conversation, An Wang asked Miller to "try and preserve [the] name," wanting it remembered as a "company founded by immigrant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.

Despite efforts, Wang Laboratories filed for bankruptcy two years after its founder's death in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. It was acquired in 1999 by the Dutch company Getronics and renamed Getronics North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

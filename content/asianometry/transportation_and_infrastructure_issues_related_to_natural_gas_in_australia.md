Australia, while being the world's [[australias_role_as_a_leading_lng_exporter | leading exporter]] of liquefied natural gas (LNG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, occasionally faces [[challenges_of_domestic_natural_gas_shortages_in_australia | natural gas shortages]] within its own domestic markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This paradox highlights the country's complex energy politics and the significant challenges posed by its geography and existing infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Uneven Distribution of Reserves and Transport Challenges

Australia possesses significant proven natural gas reserves, estimated at about 3 trillion cubic meters in conventional reserves, and potentially as much as 12 trillion cubic meters if unconventional fields like coal seam gas and shale gas are included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. However, approximately 80% of the country's conventional gas resources are concentrated in its northwest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

A major problem with natural gas is its relative difficulty in transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Historically, gas reserves have been located far from population centers, necessitating safe and reliable transportation methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Pipeline Infrastructure

For nearly a century, pipelines have been used for gas transport, proving convenient and economical for shorter distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. However, they lack flexibility and their construction can be politically controversial and intercontinental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

Critically, Australia, despite its vast size, does not have an integrated nationwide gas pipeline system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Its 47,000-kilometer network is comprised of three largely separate subsystems: the northern, western, and eastern markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Each market relies on its own local natural gas fields and pipeline systems, largely separated by physical distance and varying regulatory regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This patchwork system significantly contributes to a national energy security problem, as Australia cannot easily transport natural gas from regions of plenty to areas of urgent need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

For instance, the distance from Dampier in Western Australia to Sydney is approximately 3,202 miles, making the construction of an economically sustainable pipeline by private actors unfeasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The Whitlam federal government in the 1970s proposed building a national pipeline grid and took over an ongoing 1,200-mile pipeline project from Moomba to Sydney in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This project faced substantial political and environmental challenges, taking three years to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)

For longer distances (beyond 700 miles overseas or 2,200 miles on land), LNG becomes more economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Natural gas is cooled to -260 degrees Fahrenheit to condense into a liquid, reducing its volume to 1/600th of its former size, making it far easier to transport in tanker ships or trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The primary drawback of the LNG approach is the need for expensive liquefaction plants, which represent a significant upfront cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

#### Northwest Shelf Venture
The Northwest Shelf Venture, starting in the mid-1960s as a joint venture, discovered significant natural gas fields in Western Australia in 1971, including Scott Reef, North Rankin, and Goodwin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. These discoveries offered more than enough gas to supply the Western Australian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

The venture members planned a massive $12 billion project to develop these resources, build an LNG plant, and export LNG globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. However, a nationwide natural gas export ban, imposed in 1970 to prioritize domestic requirements, was still in effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The Western Australian market alone was too small to justify the billions needed for the project's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The lack of an integrated pipeline system also meant the gas couldn't easily serve Australia's other two markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

In 1977, after a change in federal government and adjustments to ownership, the export embargo was lifted, allowing the Northwest Shelf Venture to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The project was initially allowed to export 50% of its gas production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. It began construction in 1980 and involved offshore platforms, undersea gas pipelines, a massive LNG plant capable of processing 12 million tons of natural gas per year, LNG tankers, and a pipeline from Dampier to Perth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The first LNG exports to Japan commenced in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

### Coal Seam Gas and Eastern Markets

While Western Australia's gas fields still hold the majority of proven reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, Australia's northern and particularly eastern markets face significant supply challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. The eastern market, covering Australia's largest and fastest-growing cities (Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Hobart), lacks conventional natural gas fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

This incentivized the development of unconventional natural gas, especially coal seam gas, in the eastern regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Large methane deposits are absorbed within coal seams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Breakthroughs in harnessing this methane for commercial production occurred in 1996 in the Bowen Basin, Queensland, leading to a coal seam gas boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

The Queensland state government approved three consortia to build LNG plants and export coal seam gas to Asian markets, with the first plant coming online in December 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Today, three LNG plants on Curtis Island can produce a total of 26 million tons of LNG annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. Eastern Australia's proximity to Asia also provides a price advantage for its LNG exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

## Ongoing Challenges

Despite its position as a major natural gas exporter, Australia's domestic markets continue to face energy shortages and rising prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. While ideas like a transcontinental pipeline and a nationwide gas reservation policy are discussed, a comprehensive nationwide strategy to incorporate these solutions is still needed to resolve Australia's natural gas dilemma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

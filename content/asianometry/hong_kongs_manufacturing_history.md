Hong Kong's economic history includes a significant period as a manufacturing hub, a role that eventually diminished in favor of a service-oriented economy. The [[deindustrialization_in_hong_kong | demanufacturing of the Hong Kong economy]] is seen by some as a significant mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Origins and Early Growth
After the Chinese Civil War, Shanghai industrialists and many refugees relocated to Hong Kong to escape the Communist Party of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. These industrialists brought capital and manufacturing expertise, re-establishing their factories to utilize the labor opportunities provided by about 1 million poor Chinese migrants squatting in Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Due to limited available land, factories produced lightly manufactured items in high-rise buildings, such as plastic flowers, clothes, and radio assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Hong Kong's manufacturing industry benefited from a trend starting in the 1950s where the United States and other Western nations began sourcing manufactured goods from Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. By the early 1960s, Hong Kong was the largest manufacturer in the developing world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. These low-skilled jobs helped people make a living and build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Challenges and Decline
Competition soon emerged from places like South Korea and Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Costs rose as workers' salaries increased, and new generations of Hong Kongers demanded a better lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Hong Kong's manufacturing industries had little to offer beyond cheap labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The city's economy lacked technological expertise to produce native technologies good enough to replace unique critical components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. For example, in electronics, city-state OEMs spent 60% of their cost budget on integrated circuits imported from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This made the industry uncompetitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

As early as 1981, manufacturers requested government help to upgrade technological capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. In contrast, governments in Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea invested millions in acquiring and "naturalizing" their own technologies for commercial use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Government Policy and the Shift to Services
Hong Kong, as a British colony, had a unique economic history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The British colonial administration may have intended Hong Kong to be primarily a small trading post between China and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Early on, the government and trading houses agreed on a fiscal compromise: no import or export taxes, with revenue instead generated from land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The government holds superior title to all land, leasing it to private parties for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This created incentives for an economy focused on rising land prices and trading (financial or otherwise) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

By 1949, Hong Kong's largest companies were banks, land development companies, and trading houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Many industrialists, like Li Ka-shing, closed their factories to become landlords, finding it more profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. These dominant companies saw no reason for government intervention to support manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Consequently, the Hong Kong government maintained a non-interventionist stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

Manufacturing largely moved elsewhere, primarily to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This led to a significant loss of lower and middle-income jobs in Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, with the city doubling down on finance and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Hong Kong's economy shifted from making and exporting goods to serving as a value-added intermediary for investments and cargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Hong Kongers, with their British heritage, English language, and pro-business attitudes, facilitated international companies buying cheaply made goods from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

The service industry contributed 68% of Hong Kong's GDP in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This increased to 86.5% by 2000 and 93.4% in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Construction is the second-biggest sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Today, Hong Kong is primarily a service economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Chief executives like Tung Chee-hwa and Donald Tsang did not try to reverse the [[deindustrialization_in_hong_kong | demanufacturing trend]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. They promoted the view that Hong Kong benefits most when capital and trade flow freely between China and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. However, as China liberalized, Hong Kong's service economy model became less beneficial for its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The Pearl River region became a major logistics and transport center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, and Shanghai absorbed many of Hong Kong's service economy functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Mainland Chinese cities reformed financial restrictions, allowing foreign capital into their ports and logistics networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Hong Kong's share of China's trade with the rest of the world declined from 60% in 1997 to 28% in 2007, and just 10% in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

With transport, trade, and logistics declining, the only remaining growing sector in Hong Kong has been its [[hong_kongs_financial_services_sector | financial services sector]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Finance, insurance, and real estate contributed 18% of the economy in 2000, growing to nearly 30% in 2019, making it the city's primary growth engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. However, even this sector faces increasing competition as China lifts foreign ownership restrictions on its investing and banking markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Consequences and Missed Opportunities
The shift away from manufacturing led to a massive and growing wage inequality problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Bankers and executives earn significantly more, while most service workers, often over-educated for their jobs, have few prospects for career upgrading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

The Hong Kong government's current policy vision is somewhat unclear, but it appears to be aiming for a society where people with labor flexibility can work in high-tech industries and build wealth by investing in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. However, the financial sector alone cannot provide enough high-paying, high-value jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Less than 10% of the city's jobs come from the finance, insurance, and real estate sectors (excluding construction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Nearly 85% of Hong Kong's adult population works for large service-oriented companies that are stagnant and dominated by land developer business conglomerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. The anti-competitive nature of established markets makes it difficult for new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

The government is trying to change attitudes, having realized the need to open new career pathways for its youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. They identified emerging industries to develop, including cultural and creative (games, software), medical services, education services, testing and certification, and especially innovation and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

Despite Hong Kong's GDP reaching record highs, critics argue that the decision to [[deindustrialization_in_hong_kong | demanufacture]] the economy has generated wealth for a privileged few at the long-term detriment of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. The city's reliance on land revenue created incentives for the [[housing_and_land_issues_in_hong_kong | obscene property prices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The government's encouragement of stock ownership as a pathway to wealth for lower classes is questioned, as stocks tend to help maintain wealth rather than create it from scratch for average earners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

One argument is that Hong Kong could have maintained its service sector advantages while also developing a sophisticated manufacturing sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. For instance, a "Hong Kong TSMC" (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) could have been a possibility given close ties with the West at the time, allowing for the transfer of considerable technologies and expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Instead, the city let go of its manufacturing base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. As a result, Hong Kong has converted public goods and even its people into investable assets or cash flow streams, significantly disadvantaging its majority poor who now face limited opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

The zipper, also known as a slide fastener, is a device used to join and bind the edges of two fabrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Despite its seemingly simple function, the [[invention_and_evolution_of_the_modern_zipper | zipper industry]] has been a battleground of innovation, automation, and global competition, leading to the dominance of companies like YKK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

## Early Innovations and Talon's Dominance

The modern slide fastener was invented in 1891 by Whitcomb Judson, primarily to ease the tedium of buttoning high button boots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Judson, an engineer focused on pneumatic systems, considered the zipper a side project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. His business partners quickly recognized the product's potential, leading to the formation of a company that eventually transformed into Talon Inc., the original zipper company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

A significant advancement came 20 years later when Talon hired Swedish-American electrical engineer Gideon Sunback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Sunback, who became their head engineer, spent years improving the fastener design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. In 1917, he patented the "hookless number two," which featured the interlocking teeth structure characteristic of the modern zipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Critically, Sunback also invented a machine capable of efficiently producing this new design, enabling scale production and contributing to its eventual market dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Initially, Talon faced challenges in getting textile companies to adopt their product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Early uses included soldiers' belts, life vests, sleeping bags during World War I, and tobacco bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The term "zipper" emerged in 1923 when B.F. Goodrich used it for a rubber boot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This boot significantly boosted demand, with production surging from under 20,000 between July 1918 and March 1919 to hundreds of thousands afterward, forcing Talon to concentrate production solely on zippers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Despite Goodrich's intent for the term to refer to the boot, it quickly became associated with Talon's hookless fastener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Talon was displeased, as "zipper" became a generic trademark they couldn't control, leading them to run ads in the 1930s urging people to "call this slide fastener Talon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The adoption of zippers in garments was slow, as they were more expensive than buttons, offered fewer color options, and manufacturers worried about their weight and integration into workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Talon strategically targeted girdles for women and work clothing for men, included zippers in home sewing kits, hired a sales force, and held zipper-themed fashion shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. These efforts gradually paid off, and Talon grew steadily through the Great Depression, producing over 200 million zippers by 1939, up from 80 million just three years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## YKK's Rise: Quality, Automation, and Vertical Integration

Across the Pacific, [[history_of_ykk_and_its_founder_tadao_yoshida | Tadao Yoshida]] founded San S Shokai in January 1934 in Tokyo at the age of 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Yoshida, who started by selling remaining zipper inventory from a closed import store, initially acted as a middleman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. His primary focus was on quality, as over half of the zippers available at the time were defective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. To ensure better quality control, Yoshida's shop began producing their own zippers, establishing a metal factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This factory was destroyed by Allied bombing in March 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

After Japan's defeat, Yoshida returned to business, but a potential American buyer criticized his zippers for poor quality and high price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This feedback reinforced Yoshida's commitment to superior product quality. He identified American-made chain machines, costing $30,000-$40,000 each, as essential for achieving the desired quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. In 1949, after significant effort, he secured an import license and a 12 million yen foreign exchange loan to acquire four of these machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

The imported chain machines, which arrived in 1950, granted YKK an incredible competitive advantage, allowing six workers to do the work of 160 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Yoshida immediately commissioned a Japanese company to produce 100 replicas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. YKK further innovated these machines in 1953, improving them to attach elements at regular time intervals, eliminating the need for spacers and greatly speeding up production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Subsequent improvements made the machines easier to operate by a single person and increased production volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

A cornerstone of YKK's strategy was [[zipper_manufacturing_process_and_components | vertical integration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. In 1954, Yoshida began work on the Kurobe Factory, an integrated campus designed to produce everything from the metal wires to the textiles for the tapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This philosophy extended to YKK's overseas operations; for example, the YKK USA Factory melted its own brass, created its own polyester, and wove its own zipper tapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Yoshida believed this control over raw material production provided advantages in developing new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. YKK's prowess in automation, its ability to manufacture its own production machines, and its control over the entire supply chain firmly established its [[global_zipper_market_and_ykks_dominance | market leadership]] by 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Talon's Decline and YKK's Global Expansion

Talon's decline and YKK's ascent became evident in 1975 when Talon and the Slide Fastener Association failed to persuade the American government to restrict foreign zipper imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Talon's market share, which stood at 70% in 1971, plummeted to 35% by 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. However, YKK was already producing zippers in the United States by then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. After an initial failed attempt to enter the U.S. market in 1955, YKK began importing zipper parts for assembly in the U.S. in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. In 1974, a year before Talon's petition, YKK opened a vertically integrated factory in Macon, Georgia, which took in raw materials and produced finished zippers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This factory remains operational and has seen recent expansion, with its zippers marked as "made in the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

YKK's global strategy involved following textile manufacturers to low-cost labor regions worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Today, YKK operates factories in 71 countries, building locally to circumvent tariff barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This global, vertically integrated approach provided YKK with the nimbleness and versatility to outmaneuver its American competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

Talon's woes were exacerbated by its acquisition in 1968 by industrial conglomerate Textron for $200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Textron, being brand managers rather than textile experts, lacked the industry experience needed to maintain Talon's competitive edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Talon lost market share in industrial garments, and its only profitable business, the home sewing kit niche, declined as more women entered the workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Furthermore, Talon failed to adapt to new fashion trends emphasizing stretchier synthetic fibers and freer, more colorful clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

In contrast, YKK offered innovations that capitalized on these trends, such as the concealed zipper, which blends invisibly into garments, and plastic injection mold zippers that could be dyed into vibrant colors appealing to the flashy fashions of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Textron eventually divested Talon, which has since bounced between various private equity owners and is now owned by Hong Kong-based Tag It Pacific Inc., primarily producing in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

## Modern Zipper Market and Emerging Competition

Today, the [[global_zipper_market_and_ykks_dominance | zipper market]] is segmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>:
*   **Ultra-high luxury:** Dominated by European brands like Switzerland's Riri and Italy's Lamppo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **Low-end:** Controlled by manufacturers in China or India who compete primarily on price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Middle to high-end:** YKK makes about 80% of its $6 billion annual revenue in this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

In recent years, YKK has faced a significant competitor in the middle-to-high-end market: Fujian SBS Zipper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. Founded in 1984 in China, SBS's chairman, Kang, started similarly to Yoshida, focusing on quality control before expanding into production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. SBS has aggressively grown by selling "cheap but high quality" zippers to mid-fashion garment manufacturers like Zara, Target, and Michael Kors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Although SBS's revenue of about $300 million USD is far less than YKK's, it presents a direct challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. In response, YKK is producing even higher quality luxury zippers while also aggressively expanding its operations in China, competing with SBS on its home turf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

The evolution of the zipper over more than a century demonstrates that manufacturing can be as technologically sophisticated as any software development, requiring immense work and research and development to produce advancements often taken for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

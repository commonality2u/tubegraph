On October 16, 1964, at 3 P.M., the People's Republic of China (PRC) detonated its first domestically produced atomic bomb, joining the United States, Soviet Union, and Great Britain as one of the five Atomic Powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It took China less than five years to produce a working nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Motivation for Nuclear Development

When America was the sole possessor of the atomic bomb, Mao Zedong and the Chinese party leadership feared potential American nuclear intervention in the Chinese Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. During his visit to Stalin in December 1949, Mao sought the assurance of a "nuclear umbrella" over his country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The Soviets, having recently broken the Western monopoly, were reluctant to explicitly grant this protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance, signed after negotiations, included a clause for mutual assistance in the event of invasion, with Premier Zhou Enlai successfully suggesting the addition "with all means at its disposal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. However, no formal writing ever mentioned nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

These assurances were tested during the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. As American forces approached the Yalu River, China worried about a potential invasion of communist China and the use of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Chinese leadership intervened, believing the Americans would not risk all-out nuclear warfare with the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Mao's assessment proved correct, as the Americans did not use nuclear weapons, though they threatened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

After the Korean War, American threats, described by Chinese leadership as "nuclear blackmail," strongly influenced their resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Statements by figures like U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and Strategic Air Command General Curtis LeMay, who suggested dropping bombs in China and Russia, heightened Chinese alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. During the First Taiwan Strait Crisis (late 1954-1955), U.S. military leadership recommended using nuclear weapons, although President Eisenhower refrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The signing of a mutual defense treaty between the U.S. and the Republic of China in December 1954 further solidified China's concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. While Mao Zedong and the Communist Party likely would have pursued an atomic weapon anyway, these crises lent the process a special urgency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## [[soviet_assistance_in_chinas_nuclear_program | Soviet Assistance]]

China's first impulse for its nuclear program was to turn to its ally, the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The Soviets were China's largest external trading partner, providing loans and helping with industrial development and military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Initial Reluctance under Stalin

The PRC was aware of the Soviet nuclear program. A few weeks before the Soviet Union's first detonation in 1949, a Chinese Communist Party delegation led by Liu Shaoqi asked Stalin to tour nuclear installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Stalin, surprised, instead showed them a nuclear testing documentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. While alive, Stalin never transferred atomic technology beyond the "nuclear umbrella" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Khrushchev's Shift in Policy

After Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev became leader of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Khrushchev sought Chinese support to boost his domestic influence and help dismantle Stalinism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In October 1954, Mao asked Khrushchev for assistance with China's nuclear weapons program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. Although initially surprised and advocating for economic development, Khrushchev eventually agreed to cooperate on peaceful atomic energy use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

In April 1955, the Sino-Soviet Atomic Cooperation Treaty was signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This agreement included the provision of an experimental nuclear power plant and a cyclotron, along with Soviet nuclear experts who gave lectures and explored China's uranium reserves in Xinjiang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. In February 1956, Khrushchev expanded cooperation to include sending more Chinese students to the Soviet Union and helping build nuclear research facilities in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Transfer of Atomic Bomb Technology

The initial Soviet transfers were helpful for accelerating peaceful atomic energy reactor design, but a nuclear weapon required special techniques and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. The Soviets had initially resisted sharing design or production knowledge about nuclear weapons themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

However, a series of anti-communist protests in Hungary and Poland in late 1956 weakened the Soviets, compelling them to seek backing from their primary foreign ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. In 1957, against military advice, Khrushchev decided to transfer atomic bomb technology to the Chinese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

In October 1957, the Chinese and Soviets signed an agreement for "production of new weapons and military technology equipment and establishment of a comprehensive atomic energy industry in China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This agreement included a "teaching model atomic bomb" with designs and documentation, as well as technology for casings, processing uranium and plutonium, and testing guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

### Debate on Helpfulness of Soviet Transfers

The true helpfulness of Soviet transfers to China's nuclear weapons program is debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Khrushchev later claimed the Soviets shared "almost everything" and "kept no secrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. However, Soviet scientists were told to limit themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The Chinese were generally unimpressed with the information received, especially regarding nuclear weapons design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. A Soviet lecture on July 15, 1958, covering nuclear weapon theory, structure, and assembly, revealed no documents, only a basic blackboard sketch, and was given mostly to administrative personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. The Chinese even claimed the 1958 lecture contained "completely wrong data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Dr. Chen San Chang, who had studied in the U.S., noted that the information was similar to what was available from capitalist countries, "but with a few more details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. The subsequent Sino-Soviet split complicates these claims, as both sides were incentivized to manipulate the narrative of their contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

Regardless, the scale of technology transferred was massive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. The two countries collaborated on prospecting and mining efforts, with Soviets aiding aerial surveys and labs for China's substantial uranium mines in Xinjiang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The Chinese, however, claimed Soviet advice on prospecting sedimentary soils was unhelpful, as their best deposits were found in granite and igneous rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Crucially, the Soviets also transferred their R-12 intercontinental ballistic missile to China for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

## [[chinas_indigenous_nuclear_weapon_development | Chinese Indigenous Development]]

Despite Soviet assistance, the Chinese also made significant indigenous efforts. The PRC increased its science research funding from $15 million in 1955 to $100 million in 1956, with much of it going to the Chinese Academy of Sciences for purchasing Western scientific literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Talent Acquisition

The Chinese nuclear program actively sought out top talents, benefiting greatly from Chinese-born scientists educated or working in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Notable examples include:
*   **Dr. Qian Xuesen (Hsue-shen Tsien)**: Co-founded the Jet Propulsion Lab, controversially lost his job in the U.S. due to accusations of communist sympathies, and his persecution was a boon for the PRC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Wang Ganchang**: A nuclear physicist, who was a key figure in the program.
*   **Dr. Chen Wei Tung** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
*   **Dr. Chen San Chang** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>
*   **Peng Huanwu**: A brilliant quantum physicist who earned two doctorates in 10 years and was the first Chinese student of Nobel laureate Max Born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. He studied uranium fissioning and gamma rays at The Curie Institute in Paris, later becoming director of the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

These scientists, despite their patriotism, were unfairly targeted by far-left elements of the Communist Party as "rightist intellectuals." Zhou Enlai had to intervene in 1956 to end this persecution, and many scientists found peace only after being relocated to remote areas away from cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### Material Production Facilities

China pursued a dual-track approach, aiming to produce bombs using both uranium-235 and plutonium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

*   **Uranium-235 (Gaseous Diffusion Plant)**: Production of uranium-235 required a gaseous diffusion plant to separate uranium-235 from uranium-238 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. The Soviets significantly influenced this part of the production line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. China's gaseous diffusion plant was located in Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, and was spotted by U.S. aerial reconnaissance as early as August 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Plutonium (Nuclear Fuel Reactor)**: A plutonium bomb necessitated a nuclear fuel reactor to turn uranium-238 into plutonium-239, followed by a dangerous chemical separation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. China built an integrated plutonium fuel facility with an early Soviet design for its reactor and chemical separation plant in the Jiuquan Prefecture, also in Gansu Province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

## The Sino-Soviet Split and its Aftermath

The period of deep military technology cooperation lasted from 1957 to 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. The Sino-Soviet split, however, began as early as 1956 with Khrushchev's "secret speech" criticizing Stalin, which infuriated Mao Zedong, who saw it as an indirect attack on himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

Mao's comments at the Moscow Conference of world Communists and workers parties in November 1957, stating that even if half of mankind died in a nuclear war, "the other half would remain... and the whole world would become socialism," alarmed the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Just a month after signing the 1957 agreement, these remarks caused Khrushchev and Soviet leadership to grow dismayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

### Soviet Withdrawal of Aid

In early 1958, the Soviet leadership decided to renege on the promise of a teaching bomb prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Khrushchev delayed the transfer indefinitely, citing strained relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

The Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958, where Mao initiated shelling of the Jinmen and Matsu islands, further convinced Khrushchev that Mao was trying to provoke World War III <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. Realizing his "horrible mistake," Khrushchev sent a letter in June 1959 terminating military cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Soviet military advisers were recalled, with the last one leaving in July 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

This withdrawal meant 40% of the promised equipment and raw materials never arrived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. Of the 30 Sino-Soviet nuclear industry projects, only a minority were completed, and nine had to be entirely shut down, forcing China to restart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

### "Project 596"

Despite the blow, the withdrawal of Soviet advisors was not entirely unexpected, as PLA leaders believed the Soviets aimed to maintain a technical gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. In January 1960, the Chinese initiated "Project 596," named to commemorate the "shameful date" of Soviet aid withdrawal, signifying its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Zhou Enlai declared they would achieve a breakthrough in three years, master technical know-how in five, and have a stockpile in eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

Amidst the economic and social pressures of the Great Leap Forward, China abandoned the dual-track approach, postponing the plutonium bomb and focusing solely on the uranium-235 design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

At the Lanzhou facility, plant leader Wang Jeff personally escorted the last Soviet advisors in July 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Technicians had to pick up the slack, sourcing tens of thousands of materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. The Great Leap Forward caused turmoil, with technicians disassembling Soviet electrical equipment for "technological innovation," requiring a direct appeal to Mao to stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. Food shortages in 1960 also impacted staff, but Wang refused to slow progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

By the end of 1961, 700 difficult days after Soviet aid severance, Lanzhou's machinery was successfully installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The Chinese found substitutes for many Soviet components, including a special lubricant kept in a locked room by the advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. By mid-1963, Lanzhou scientists were successfully isolating uranium-235, achieving 90% enrichment by January 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. Mao Zedong's reaction to the report was "very good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

### Bomb Design and Assembly

After enriching the uranium, the next step was to design and assemble the bomb itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. A nuclear explosion results from an uncontrolled fission chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. While the first American bomb (Hiroshima) used a gun design, China chose an implosion design, like the Nagasaki bomb, as it required less physical material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. Instead of plutonium, the Chinese used uranium-235 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.

The key challenge was synchronizing high explosives to initiate the chain reaction, avoiding a premature neutron burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. Unlike the British, who had scientists at Los Alamos, the Chinese lacked such direct access but knew the theory of how to achieve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. By the time the Soviets left in 1960, Chinese theoretical work was complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. They were aided by "sloppy shredding" of critical papers by the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. Working in Beijing suburbs, a team used hand calculators to work through equations and simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. By late 1962, they mastered implosion theory, and a year later, finalized their implosion mechanism design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.

In late 1963, enriched uranium arrived at the nuclear component manufacturing plant in Subei, Gansu Province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. There, craftsmen machined it into a ball of highly enriched uranium and packaged it into the "596 bomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.

## International Reaction and Cost

The successful nuclear test caught both the Americans and Soviets off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. The U.S. government knew about the Chinese program since 1959 and considered intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>. President Kennedy in 1961 feared a nuclear China would lead to all of Southeast Asia falling to Communists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. In the early 1960s, Kennedy even probed Khrushchev about military intervention, but Khrushchev never broke the idea, and some Kennedy administration members downplayed the consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

China's decision to use an implosion-type uranium bomb, rather than plutonium, confused American spymasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. They knew about the Lanzhou gaseous diffusion plant but mistakenly thought it too small for a real nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. Ultimately, the Americans underestimated the Chinese nuclear effort until the eve of the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

### Overall Cost and Legacy

[[chinas_indigenous_nuclear_weapon_development | China's indigenous nuclear bomb program]] was one of its largest undertakings, involving hundreds of thousands of people in over 900 factories, research institutes, and schools across 20 provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. The 10-year program cost an estimated 10.7 billion RMB, or $4.1 billion in 1957 prices, a staggering amount for an undeveloped nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. Many of these costs were incurred during the economically difficult years of the Great Leap Forward and early 1960s, forcing cuts in other government projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

Scholars continue to debate the extent to which the Chinese program benefited from [[soviet_assistance_in_chinas_nuclear_program | Soviet technology transfer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. Deng Xiaoping told the Romanian Ambassador in 1966 that had the Soviets not broken the treaty, China wouldn't have built the bombs so fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. While the Soviets gave a lot, much work remained after their departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>. The "sting and shame" of the abrogated treaty ultimately provided the Chinese with the "force of will" to finish the job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. The successful detonation of China's atomic bomb significantly influenced [[impact_of_nuclear_weapons_on_cold_war_dynamics | Cold War dynamics]].

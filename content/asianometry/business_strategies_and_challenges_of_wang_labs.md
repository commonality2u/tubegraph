Wang Laboratories' trajectory, from its founding to its eventual decline, was shaped by its evolving business strategies and the significant challenges it faced in the rapidly changing technology landscape.

## Early Business Model and Strategic Shifts

Founded on June 30, 1951, Wang Laboratories began with only $600 in savings and its founder, An Wang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Initially, Wang focused on producing and selling core memories for about four dollars each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. An Wang, as the sole employee, personally handled all sales, reaching out to clients methodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

An early strategy involved licensing his pending patent on core memory to [[challenges_faced_by_icl_in_competing_with_ibm | IBM]], which began using the memory in their electronic calculating machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. After a year of talks, a deal was struck in 1953, providing consulting revenue and a future option for [[challenges_faced_by_icl_in_competing_with_ibm | IBM]] to buy his patent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This income allowed the company to hire its first employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. In 1955, [[challenges_faced_by_icl_in_competing_with_ibm | IBM]] paid Wang between $400,000 and $500,000 for the patent, equivalent to about $4.4 to $5.5 million today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

This payout allowed Wang to pivot from consulting towards product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. However, An Wang harbored "special ill will" towards [[challenges_faced_by_icl_in_competing_with_ibm | IBM]] for a long time, partly because [[challenges_faced_by_icl_in_competing_with_ibm | IBM]] paid $13 million to Jay Wright Forester for a more complete application of core memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Product Development and Market Success

### Calculators
In the early 1960s, Wang partnered with Compugraphic to design and produce the Linasec, a machine that justified lines of text for publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. While successful, generating significant revenue growth, Wang learned a crucial lesson when Compugraphic started producing the machine themselves, cutting Wang out of future revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. An Wang subsequently vowed never to produce a product over which he did not have full control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

Wang's first fully controlled hit was the Loci (Logarithmic Calculating Instrument), introduced in January 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. This small, powerful calculator used natural logarithms, capable of finding advanced logarithms with fewer than 300 logic transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. It sold 10 to 20 units a month at $6,500 to science labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

Recognizing the Loci's complexity, Wang introduced the Wang 300 calculator in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Priced at $1,695 and easy to use, it became an immediate hit, selling to scientists, researchers, stockbrokers, and insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. The Wang 300's success led to revenues nearly tripling from $2.5 million in 1965 to $6.9 million in 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. That year, Wang Laboratories went public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

### Transition to Computers and Word Processing
By 1971, with the calculator market becoming increasingly difficult due to the introduction of microprocessors by Intel, An Wang made the "incredibly ballsy decision" to pull out of the calculator market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Calculators then constituted 75% of the company's revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. Wang saw the computer as the future and pursued a two-pronged strategy:
1.  **General-purpose computers:** The Wang 3300 Basic reached the market in 1970 but was not successful, taking 40 minutes to program with paper tape loading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
2.  **Word processors:** The company aimed to replace [[challenges_faced_by_icl_in_competing_with_ibm | IBM]]'s Magnetic Tape Selectric electric typewriter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. The first iteration, the Wang 1200, announced in November 1971, faced reliability issues due to improper components in its connection to [[challenges_faced_by_icl_in_competing_with_ibm | IBM]]'s typewriter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

Despite initial setbacks, three key products brought Wang back from the brink:
*   **Wang 2200 (1973):** A successor to the 3300 Basic, it used [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | Intel]]'s ROM chips for instant wake capability and was affordable, selling well as a small business computer for a decade and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   **Wang Word Processing System (WPS) (1976):** Learning from the 1200's shortcomings, the WPS was redesigned to be powerful, upgradable, and easy to use. It featured a network of machines with individual microprocessors, a CRT screen, and a simplified menu system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. The WPS was an "immediate hit," bringing the company "back from the brink" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   **Wang VS Minicomputer (1977):** This minicomputer competed against [[challenges_faced_by_icl_in_competing_with_ibm | Digital Equipment Corporation]]'s VAX line, offering near-mainframe power in a smaller, cheaper package suitable for commercial applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

These three products generated billions in revenue for Wang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. By the late 1970s, Wang was the world's largest supplier of CRT-based word processing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

### Marketing and Growth
In 1978, to boost its profile beyond being a calculator maker, Wang launched a massive three-month TV ad blitz, culminating in a Super Bowl ad that cost $150,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. This "David vs. Goliath" campaign directly attacked [[challenges_faced_by_icl_in_competing_with_ibm | IBM]] and significantly increased Wang's brand awareness from 3% to 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. Revenues doubled from 1978 to 1980, and again by 1982, reaching $1 billion, and then $2 billion by 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. In 1983, 80% of the largest U.S. firms bought Wang equipment, with nearly half of the company's revenues coming from Fortune 500 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

## Challenges and Decline

Wang Laboratories' [[the_decline_and_fall_of_wang_labs | decline]] was multi-faceted, stemming from internal management issues and a failure to adapt to market shifts.

### Leadership and Succession Challenges
An Wang was known for being a "sharp, very tough businessman" who obsessed over every detail of his company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. He was also a micromanager and "not a great boss," envisioning passing control to his son, Fred Wang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

After An Wang formally retired in 1983, appointing John A. Cunningham as president, the crucial role of product development, previously overseen by An Wang, became a major point of contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. An Wang's decision in 1980 to place his son, Fred, in charge of the critical R&D department proved disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. Despite being intelligent, Fred lacked his father's technical acumen and ability to manage strong personalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

### Product Delays and Market Misjudgment
In October 1983, Wang Labs announced 14 new products, including the Wang Professional Image Computer, aiming to compete with [[challenges_faced_by_icl_in_competing_with_ibm | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>. While the market initially responded positively, causing the stock to soar, these products were delivered very late, some years behind schedule, severely damaging Fred's credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.

Crucially, An Wang "resisted the PC," viewing it as another "calculator, a future dead end commodity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. Two years earlier, [[challenges_faced_by_icl_in_competing_with_ibm | IBM]] had released the [[challenges_faced_by_icl_in_competing_with_ibm | IBM]] PC, which quickly eroded Wang's specialized word processor and 2200 computer markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. Although Fred pushed for Wang to build its own PC, it lacked compatibility with the [[challenges_faced_by_icl_in_competing_with_ibm | IBM]] PC's massive software ecosystem, making it "Dead on Arrival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

### Financial Distress and End of Family Control
The botched 1983 product announcement and the company's reckless expansion led to increasing debt and a series of losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. An Wang rejected potential mergers that could have shored up debt, fearing a loss of family control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

In April 1985, Wang Labs announced a 66% quarterly profit decline, followed by the resignation of respected president John Cunningham in July 1985, who sold all his stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. Despite repeated requests from the board to bring in a professional manager, An Wang refused, famously stating, "He is my son and he can do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

Losses mounted throughout 1988, leading to a $424 million annual loss in July 1989 and a stock crash from $43 to $5 a share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. Diagnosed with esophageal cancer in 1989, An Wang was forced to fire his son, Fred, in August 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. Richard Miller, a turnaround expert, was appointed president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. Despite massive asset sales and layoffs, the company reported a $715.9 million loss in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

An Wang died on March 24, 1990, at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. Two years later, in 1992, Wang Laboratories filed for bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. Its [[legacy_and_impact_of_an_wang_and_wang_labs | legacy]] ended with its acquisition in 1999 by Getronics, renamed Getronics North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

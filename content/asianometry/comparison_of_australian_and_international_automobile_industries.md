The Australian automobile industry once employed 100,000 people and produced tens of thousands of vehicles for both domestic consumption and export. These cars were uniquely suited for the Australian market and prized in rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, this industry has now vanished, with the last factory (operated by Toyota) closing in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

## Rise of the Australian Automobile Industry

Emerging from World War II, the Australian government sought to rebuild its economy and nurture its manufacturing capacity, prioritizing car manufacturing. It offered foreign companies subsidies and tax concessions to encourage production on Australian soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Several foreign manufacturers, including Volkswagen, British Motors Leyland, and Ford, entered the market. Most of these facilities assembled imported parts, but some brought value-add activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

The most notable was GM Holden, an Australian subsidiary of American automaker GM. In 1948, it produced the first "all-Australian" car, the Holden, in Melbourne. This rugged car was well-suited for Australia's rural areas and dominated the Australian car market throughout the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. By 1951, Holden was Australia's most profitable publicly traded company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

This domestic manufacturing industry grew within a protected market due to high tariffs, which guaranteed demand for domestic employers. These employers could then afford to pay a "fair and reasonable basic wage," supported by strong trade unions and a compulsory arbitration system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Local auto manufacturing supported a local auto parts ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

## Global Automotive Industry vs. Australian Context

The world automotive industry is characterized by large multinational firms such as Volkswagen, Toyota, and GM. These companies are highly nationally diversified, use component suppliers from many countries, and produce products based on a common basic design tailored to international customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

A key difference for Australia was that none of its car manufacturing companies were actually owned by Australians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
*   **Upsides**: Australia's car-making industry benefited from being part of a larger globalized network, allowing Australian-made auto components to be produced at scale and exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Downsides**: The companies could not embed deeply within the local industry, as profits flowed to Japanese or American headquarters. Executives abroad lacked emotional attachment to Australia, making core decisions based solely on the bottom line. This meant Australia did not control its own automaking destiny, a "worst of both worlds" situation that would later become a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

## Decline and Loss of Competitiveness

By the early 1970s, the Australian domestic automotive manufacturing industry employed over 100,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. However, the 1970s saw a substantial loss of competitiveness:
*   **Lack of Economies of Scale**: Automakers produced too many models (five companies producing as many as 15), with individual production runs as small as 25,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. This contrasts with modern car manufacturers who aim to produce around 250,000 cars per factory per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:00">[20:44:00]</a>.
*   **Loss of Customer Connection**: Australian cars were treasured for their rural ruggedness, but most Australians lived in cities. This created a market gap, especially for small cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   **Rise of Imports**: This gap was filled by high-quality, low-cost small cars from Japanese imports, such as the Datsun, which gained a significant market foothold despite tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   **Oil Crisis Impact**: The OPEC oil embargo in 1973 spurred sales of gas-sipping alternatives. Sales of small and medium four-cylinder cars (dominated by Japanese manufacturers) surged, while the market share of large six-cylinder cars (the domain of Australian carmakers) collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. This illustrates a "disruptive innovation" where an upstart takes root in an established market and moves upmarket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.

## Government Policy and Its Impact

### Whitlam Government Reforms (1970s)
The Whitlam government (1972) did not favor foreign multinational car makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. Facing inflation, it sought to liberalize trade policies to provide a competitive jolt to the domestic industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. Officials believed the economy could survive a rapid drop in trade protections, partly because lowering tariffs would expand international trade opportunities and help cement a reorientation towards Japan, which was buying large amounts of Australian minerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.

The most controversial part was an abrupt 25% reduction in all tariffs on imported goods in 1973 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. This confrontational tactic led GM Holden to fire 5,000 workers, sparking a political crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. While the government later reimposed import quotas in 1974-1975 to stem job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>, the abrupt tariff reduction cemented industry opposition to the Australian Labour Party's reforms for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

### Comparison to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)
The Australian reforms were likely not executed optimally, particularly due to the abrupt reduction of tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. A major missing ingredient was a government entity that could coordinate the industry's transition, akin to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.

In the 1960s, Japan faced a similar situation with too many car makers and decreasing competitiveness. MITI responded by arranging mergers among them to create two giants: Toyota and Nissan. MITI's core tenet was to protect and nurture Japan's car makers until they were ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>. The Australian government, influenced by rationalism and a deregulated market philosophy, opted for a different path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.

### Hawke Government Reforms (1980s)
In the mid-1980s, a new government under Prime Minister Hawke pursued major macroeconomic policy changes, including banking sector deregulation, financial market liberalization, and floating the Australian dollar. The intention was to reorient domestic manufacturing industries towards exports, as high tariffs had created inefficient industries unable to compete overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>.

The "New Car Plan" (1983) offered car manufacturers credits and subsidies for Australian-made cars and temporary government support, but also rapidly reduced import tariffs from 57.5% to 45% by 1988, with further reductions until 2000, and removed import quotas. The goal was to slim the domestic industry into a leaner, more competitive entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. While the industry did shrink, unexpectedly, Australian-made cars became less competitive. Domestic car makers responded with cost-cutting, reducing investment in R&D and manufacturing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>. Foreign companies had entered the Australian market mainly to bypass trade protections; when these vanished, they saw little reason to maintain expensive manufacturing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Final Decline

*   **Shrinking Market Share**: Despite annual government support of AUD 500 million (through schemes like the Automotive Competitive and Investment Scheme (ACIS), which cost AUD 7 billion from 2001-2011), the domestic makers' share of the overall market continued to shrink as Australia's economy and population grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>.
*   **Strong Australian Dollar**: A mining boom starting in 2000 led to a dramatic appreciation of the Australian dollar, which doubled in value against the American dollar over ten years. While a "stronger" currency might seem positive, it significantly increased the cost of Australian automotive production, leading to chronic losses for the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.
*   **Plant Closures**: From 2003 to 2010, the industry lost 25,000 jobs. Mitsubishi closed its engine and assembly plants in Southern Adelaide in 2004, leading to 1,167 job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>. Mitsubishi's domestically produced cars were already receiving AUD 1,300 in subsidies per unit by 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a>.
*   **High Labor Costs**: Australian labor is expensive, costing multiples more than Thai labor, for example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:00">[21:04:00]</a>. In other high-labor-cost countries like Canada and the United States, unions bent on issues of entitlements, wages, and pensions. For instance, the American United Automobile Workers allowed car makers to produce more than one car on a single production line and lowered entry wages for new workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>. While Australian labor unions eventually collaborated more closely with automakers after the financial crisis, it was not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>.

The **[[role_of_australian_government_in_the_automobile_industrys_decline | government's role]]** remained a point of contention. The industry had absorbed billions in subsidies with little to show for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>. The Abbott government (2013) disagreed with previous government interventions, stating that "the government's role is not to prop up private business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a>. This stance, coupled with uncertainty and constant delays in new government policies, contributed to instability. Faced with this, Toyota and GM pulled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a>.

## Consequences and Blame

The loss of Australia's domestic auto industry had wide-ranging consequences:
*   **Impact on Components Industry**: 260 Australian businesses supplied the automotive sector. Without the domestic assembly industry to anchor them, many did not achieve sufficient economies of scale and closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:00">[23:01:00]</a>. For example, 70% of the Toyota Camry's parts had once been made in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>.
*   **Loss of R&D Spending**: Automotive R&D spending by Australian companies, which was AUD 700 million in its final years (2% of the country's total R&D), vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>.
*   **Worker Displacement**: Approximately 14,000 people lost their jobs when Toyota and GM Holden factories closed. Two years after the closure, less than half of surveyed workers were still working, a quarter were looking for work, and the rest had retired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:00">[23:53:00]</a>.

While there are "no heroes or villains" in this story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:28:00">[25:28:00]</a>, countries must deal with their circumstances. Australia's remote location and higher costs of living were significant factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:31:00">[25:31:00]</a>. Despite billions poured into the industry, the economics and economies of scale were not there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:44:00">[25:44:00]</a>.

Canada is sometimes pointed to as an example of an auto industry that survived despite similar high labor costs and a strong, oil-fueled currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>. The Canadian government did consolidate its auto industry, but Canada shares a border with the United States, and its factories are far more productive, with an average output three times higher than Australia's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:14:00">[25:14:00]</a>.

It is suggested that the government could have been more involved at critical times, perhaps by forcibly intervening to merge domestic OEMs into one or investing a controlling share, similar to Japan's MITI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:54:00">[25:54:00]</a>.

Despite the manufacturing decline, Australia continues to leverage its educated labor force to develop new automotive technologies. For instance, the former Toyota Altona factory is being converted into a transport hub for green hydrogen technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>.

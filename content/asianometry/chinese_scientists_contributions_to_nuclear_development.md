On October 16, 1964, the People's Republic of China (PRC) detonated their first domestically produced atomic bomb, making China one of the five Atomic Powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03"></a>. This achievement took China less than five years to produce a working nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17"></a>.

## Early Motivations and the Nuclear Imperative

Initially, Mao Zedong and the Chinese party leadership feared potential American nuclear intervention in the Chinese Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29"></a>. During his visit to Stalin in December 1949, Mao sought the assurance of a nuclear umbrella over China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37"></a>. However, the Soviets were reluctant to explicitly grant this protection in the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Alliance, and Mutual Assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49"></a>.

The issue of nuclear weapons became particularly pressing during the Korean War, as American forces approached the Yalu River, raising fears of an invasion of communist China and the potential use of the atomic bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34"></a>. Though Mao's decision to intervene worked and the Americans did not use nuclear weapons, the subsequent threats, described by Chinese leadership as "nuclear blackmail," had a strong impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06"></a>. Comments from U.S. officials, such as General Curtis LeMay's suggestion to "drop a few bombs in proper places in China," fueled Chinese alarm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31"></a>. The First Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1954-1955 also saw U.S. military leadership recommend nuclear weapon use, though Eisenhower refrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53"></a>. These crises lent "special urgency" to China's pursuit of its own atomic weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23"></a>.

## Sino-Soviet Cooperation and Early Scientific Foundations

China's initial impulse for its nuclear program was to approach its Soviet allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29"></a>. The PRC had long been aware of the Soviet nuclear program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49"></a>. While Stalin had previously only offered "protection" via their nuclear umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11"></a>, Nikita Khrushchev, after becoming leader in 1953, proved more open to collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21"></a>.

In October 1954, Mao asked Khrushchev for assistance in China's nuclear weapons program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58"></a>. Despite initial reluctance, the Soviets agreed to cooperate on peaceful atomic energy use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17"></a>. In April 1955, the Sino-Soviet Atomic Cooperation Treaty was signed, committing the Soviets to provide an experimental nuclear power plant and a cyclotron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26"></a>. Soviet nuclear experts were sent to China, and Chinese students were sent to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48"></a>.

During this period of high Sino-Soviet relations, China significantly increased its science research funding, from $15 million in 1955 to $100 million in 1956, with much of it going to the Chinese Academy of Sciences to purchase Western science literature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46"></a>.

### Influx of Talent

The Chinese nuclear program actively sought out the nation's best talents, benefiting significantly from the return of Chinese-born scientists who had been educated or worked in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04"></a>.
Notable figures included:
*   **Dr. Qian Xuesen**: Co-founder of the Jet Propulsion Lab, whose controversial persecution in America due to accusations of communist sympathies proved "a boon for the PRC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14"></a>.
*   **Chen Wei Tung** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30"></a>
*   **Chen San Chang**: Already familiar with nuclear weapon theoretical concepts from his time in the U.S., he attended Soviet lectures on nuclear weapons and found the information similar to what was available in "capitalist countries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32"></a>.
*   **Peng Huanwu**: A brilliant quantum physicist who earned two doctorates in 10 years and was the first Chinese student to study under Nobel Prize winner Max Born <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38"></a>. He studied uranium fissioning and gamma rays at The Curie Institute in Paris before becoming director of the Institute of Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences upon his return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50"></a>.

Despite their patriotism, these returning scientists faced unfair attacks from far-left elements of the Communist Party, leading to Zhou Enlai calling a meeting in 1956 to end the persecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07"></a>. They ultimately found peace by being moved to remote locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24"></a>.

## Shift Towards Military Cooperation and Growing Tensions

By 1957, while the Soviets had transferred technology accelerating peaceful reactor design, they resisted sharing knowledge about nuclear weapons design or production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31"></a>. However, anti-communist protests in Hungary and Poland in late 1956, and the subsequent Soviet repression, weakened the Soviets, making them more reliant on China's backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01"></a>.

Consequently, in 1957, Khrushchev decided to transfer [[role_of_soviet_technology_transfer_in_chinas_nuclear_development | atomic bomb technology]] to the Chinese, against the advice of his military and Ivan Kurchatov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20"></a>. This led to the October 1957 agreement, promising a "teaching model atomic bomb" with designs and documentation, plus technology for processing uranium and plutonium and testing guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31"></a>.

Despite Khrushchev's later claims of sharing "almost everything," the Soviets told their scientists to limit what they shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11"></a>. A key Soviet lecture in July 1958 on nuclear weapon theory provided only a basic sketch on a blackboard, no documents or parameters, and notes were not allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52"></a>. Chinese accounts claimed this lecture contained "completely wrong data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23"></a>. The subsequent Sino-Soviet split complicates assessing the true helpfulness of these transfers, as both sides were incentivized to manipulate the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51"></a>.

Regardless, the scale of initial [[role_of_soviet_technology_transfer_in_chinas_nuclear_development | Soviet technology transferred]] was massive, including collaboration on uranium prospecting and mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03"></a>. The Soviets also provided critical R-12 intercontinental ballistic missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41"></a>.

## The Sino-Soviet Split and Self-Reliance

By 1956, issues leading to the Sino-Soviet split began to emerge, particularly Khrushchev's secret speech criticizing Stalin, which infuriated Mao Zedong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06"></a>. Mao's cavalier comments at the 1957 Moscow Conference about the acceptability of a nuclear war further dismayed Khrushchev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24"></a>. This led to the Soviet decision in early 1958 to renege on sending the teaching bomb prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10"></a>. There were "endless delays" and excuses, and the transfer was eventually postponed indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34"></a>. The Second Taiwan Strait Crisis in 1958 also made Khrushchev realize his "horrible mistake" in aiding China's program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58"></a>.

In June 1959, Khrushchev informed China of the termination of military cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26"></a>. By July 1960, the last Soviet advisor had left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40"></a>. Forty percent of promised equipment and raw materials never arrived, and only a minority of the 30 Sino-Soviet nuclear industry projects were completed, forcing China to restart many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45"></a>.

The withdrawal of Soviet aid, though a blow, was not entirely unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03"></a>. Chinese leadership suspected the Soviets aimed to maintain a technical gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11"></a>. In January 1960, China launched the "596 project" (named to commemorate the "shameful date" of Soviet aid withdrawal), signaling a full commitment to self-reliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27"></a>. Zhou Enlai declared they would achieve a breakthrough in three years, master technical know-how in five, and have a stockpile in eight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40"></a>.

Due to economic and social pressures from the Great Leap Forward, China abandoned its dual-track approach and focused solely on the uranium-235 design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52"></a>.

### The Development of the Atomic Bomb

Chinese scientists and technicians were forced to pick up the slack after the Soviet departure, sorting through and sourcing tens of thousands of raw materials and supplies for the uranium-235 production line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18"></a>. Despite challenges like Great Leap Forward fervor leading to disassembly of Soviet-provided equipment and severe food shortages, progress continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33"></a>.

By the end of 1961, the machinery for the Lanzo gaseous diffusion plant was successfully installed, and Chinese scientists found reasonable substitutes for many Soviet components, including a special lubricant for diffusion pumps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08"></a>. By mid-1963, uranium-235 was being isolated, and by January 1964, 90% enrichment was achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33"></a>.

For the bomb's design, China chose an implosion design, similar to the one dropped on Nagasaki, but using uranium-235 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21"></a>. The key challenge was synchronizing the high explosives to initiate the chain reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46"></a>. Despite not having the advantage of working at Los Alamos like British scientists, China knew the theory was possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04"></a>. By 1960, Chinese scientists had completed theoretical work, aided by "sloppy shredding" of critical papers by the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17"></a>. Working with hand calculators in Beijing, they mastered implosion theory by the end of 1962 and had the final design by 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32"></a>.

In late 1963, enriched uranium arrived at the Subei plant in Gansu Province, where craftsmen machined it into a ball of highly enriched uranium and assembled the "596 bomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47"></a>.

## Conclusion

The successful [[chinas_first_nuclear_bomb_test | Chinese nuclear test]] surprised both the Americans and Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06"></a>. American spymasters were confused by China's choice of a uranium-235 implosion bomb, underestimating the capabilities of their gaseous diffusion plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44"></a>.

China's indigenous nuclear program was a massive undertaking, involving hundreds of thousands of people across numerous factories, research institutes, and schools, at a staggering cost of approximately 10.7 billion RMB (or $4.1 billion in 1957 prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18"></a>. These costs were incurred during the economically difficult years of the Great Leap Forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47"></a>.

The extent to which the Chinese program benefited from [[role_of_soviet_technology_transfer_in_chinas_nuclear_development | Soviet technology transfer]] remains a subject of debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57"></a>. Deng Xiaoping acknowledged that Soviet aid initially accelerated the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08"></a>. However, the subsequent withdrawal of Soviet assistance, described as a "sting and shame," provided the Chinese with the "force of will to finish the job" themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23"></a>.

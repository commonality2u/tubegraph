High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) systems offer a solution for transmitting electricity over long distances, particularly for large-scale renewable energy projects like the Australia-ASEAN Power Link, also known as the "Sun Cable" project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This project aims to bring solar energy from Australia to Singapore via a 2,300-mile (3,700-kilometer) HVDC underwater power line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. While advantageous for long-distance power transmission, HVDC systems, especially subsea installations, present significant challenges.

## HVDC vs. HVAC: The Choice for Long Distances
Historically, Alternating Current (AC) systems became the standard for power transmission due to their economic efficiency over shorter distances, primarily because AC transformers can step up and step down voltage more affordably than equivalent DC equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

However, High Voltage AC (HVAC) systems lose a lot of efficiency the further the power source is from the consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. A significant reason for this is the "skin effect," where AC flows more densely at the surface of a cable, increasing resistance and power loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

HVDC systems were developed to address this shortcoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. While the initial terminal cost of DC systems is substantially higher due to complex converters and inverters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>, the cost of the line rises faster with AC than DC over longer distances, mainly due to significantly faster rising energy losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. For example, a 2,000-kilometer AC line can have twice the losses of a DC line even if carrying half the power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

For long distances, particularly beyond a "breakeven distance" of about 62 miles (100 kilometers), HVDC becomes more economical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. The Sun Cable's 3,200-kilometer route is estimated to have about 10% electrical loss with HVDC, while an equivalent HVAC line would likely have over twice that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. HVDC is particularly well-suited for undersea infrastructure where intermediate substations are not practical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

## [[challenges_in_laying_and_protecting_undersea_cables | Challenges in Laying and Protecting Undersea Cables]]
[[subsea_cable_laying_and_its_technical_challenges | Subsea cable laying]] adheres to two main rules: keep the cable length as short as possible to reduce manufacturing and maintenance costs, and avoid big deep trenches and steep slopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.

### Route Complexity and Deep Water
Most existing subsea power cables are laid in relatively shallow depths (under 1 kilometer) on flat-bottomed seas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. However, the proposed Sun Cable route faces challenges as Australia is surrounded by steep slopes and deep water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. The route would travel from Darwin, across the Timor Sea, through Indonesia (either between Bali and Lombok or Lombok and Sumbawa), and then up the Java Sea to Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

While much of the route would be shallow (less than 200 meters deep), a 700-mile (1,200-kilometer) section south of East Timor in the Timor Trough would encounter waters over a mile deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. This represents a major challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. Although deep-water subsea cables have been laid before (e.g., the SA.PE.I cable from Sardinia to Italy reached similar depths), special attention is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. For instance, the SA.PE.I's deepwater cables used lighter aluminum instead of traditional copper to facilitate laying more cable from a vessel, reducing expensive and time-consuming deepwater ship operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

### Interference and Protection in Shallow Waters
For shallower sections, such as the Java Sea and Singapore Strait, which are among the busiest waterways globally, the most significant factor is potential interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. These areas are already crisscrossed by pipelines, fishing trawlers, and communication cables, and thousands of ships pass through the Singapore Strait annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

To protect the cable from being dredged up by fishing nets or damaged by boat anchors and other dropped objects, engineers will likely need to trench or bury the cable 2-5 feet (0.6-1.5 meters) deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. Such damage can cause blackouts and trigger liability clauses in service agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

## Manufacturing Bottlenecks
A significant challenge, even greater than laying the cable, is acquiring the HVDC cable itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. The HVDC cable manufacturing industry is a niche market with complex products and slow output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

The Sun Cable project, as currently proposed, requires two cables, each 3,200 kilometers long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. This demand exceeds the total annual output of all HVDC cable manufacturers in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. Consequently, additional money and time (an estimated 3-5 years) must be allocated to build up manufacturing capacity from multiple global manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

## Financial Hurdles and Operational Lessons
The subsea cable portion alone of the Sun Cable project is projected to cost about $5.6 billion USD before insurance and administrative expenses, with the majority ($4.6 billion) going towards the cable itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>. The entire project, including the solar farm, is likely to exceed $10 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.

Funding such a massive project typically requires multi-decade service agreements between the company providing the power and the purchasing entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. The Basslink HVDC cable, connecting Tasmania to mainland Australia, derives its cash flows from a 25-year service agreement with Hydro Tasmania, which enabled it to raise private money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.

Operational challenges are also a concern. Less than a decade after its 2006 commissioning, Basslink suffered a brutal outage that took six months to repair amidst difficult seas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>. This led to arbitration where Basslink was fined $30 million USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. The financial strain led to a technical default, delaying repairs for another two-month outage in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>. These incidents highlight the importance of learning from past mistakes to avoid similar issues in future large-scale infrastructure projects like Sun Cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

Despite these significant challenges, the Sun Cable project is scheduled to come online around 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>, aiming to provide up to 20% of Singapore's energy needs and open new energy export paradigms for Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.

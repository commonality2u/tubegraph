In the years following India's independence in 1947, millions of Indians lacked access to essential drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The nation's drug industry was predominantly controlled by foreign entities, with eight of the top ten firms being Western multinationals, primarily from the UK, France, and Germany, collectively holding a 90% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Domestic Indian companies largely focused on marketing and distributing foreign drugs rather than developing their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. As a result, almost every drug consumed in India had to be imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, leading to some of the world's highest domestic drug prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. With 99% of these drugs protected by patents, only the wealthy could afford them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Genesis of the Act

The Indian government attempted to address this over-reliance on foreign drug imports by establishing public sector pharmaceutical firms like Hindustan Antibiotics Limited (1954) and Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited (late 1950s, with Soviet cooperation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. A pivotal moment occurred in the 1960s when the British pharmaceutical company ICI Pharmaceuticals developed Propranolol, a high blood pressure medication. An Indian company, Cipla, began manufacturing a generic version for the Indian market, which led to a complaint from ICI to the Indian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Cipla's R&D head, Yusuf Hamid, justified his actions to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who recognized the argument's merits and urged parliament to reform drug patent laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This advocacy culminated in the passing of the Patent Act of 1970, which revitalized the [[growth_of_indias_pharmaceutical_industry | Indian pharmaceutical industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Goals and Key Provisions

The Patent Act of 1970 had two primary objectives:
*   To ensure low-cost access to drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   To foster the development of an indigenous [[growth_of_indias_pharmaceutical_industry | Indian pharmaceutical industry]] and encourage import substitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Prior to 1970, India's patent laws, last updated in 1872 and rooted in British IP law, protected products (e.g., a specific chemical compound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The 1970 Act fundamentally changed this by protecting the *process* of making a drug rather than the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It also set time limits on these process patents, reducing them to approximately five to seven years after filing, compared to the previous 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Furthermore, the Act granted the Indian Patent Office the authority to compel patent holders to license their patents to others at a reasonable rate if they determined the patents were not being used in a socially beneficial manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Impact on Drug Accessibility and Domestic Industry

These new provisions created significant opportunities for the [[growth_of_indias_pharmaceutical_industry | Indian pharmaceutical industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. It became possible for domestic firms to "backward engineer" popular imported drugs for the Indian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Managers and scientists from India's public sector laboratories capitalized on this change, leading to a doubling of the number of firms in the industry between 1970 and 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Initially, Indian companies focused on reverse-engineering existing drugs by making slight modifications to their manufacturing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. While seemingly simple, this approach allowed domestic companies to gain significant competency in pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. By the end of the 1980s, Indian pharmaceutical companies could manufacture virtually any new molecule without needing the original innovator's recipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This growing capability was evident in the narrowing time gap between the introduction of original innovations and Indian generics:
*   Ibuprofen: Original in 1967, Indian generic in 1973 (6 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   Ciprofloxacin: Original in 1986, Indian generic in 1989 (3 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

By 2006, Indian companies supplied 95% of the country's drugs, signifying a successful import substitution policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This dramatically improved drug accessibility for the Indian population by significantly lowering costs.

## Drawbacks and Subsequent Shifts

Despite its success in promoting access and domestic production, the 1970 Patent Act had drawbacks:
*   **Low Value, High Volume Industry**: The industry became characterized by high volume but low value due to low barriers to entry and minimal capital requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. By 1990, there were approximately 16,000 pharmaceutical companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Low Margins and Overcapacity**: Companies focused on producing many molecules as cheaply as possible, leading to extremely low margins and vast overcapacity, requiring massive scale for profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Fragmentation**: The industry became highly fragmented, with up to 100 brands for a single molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Lack of Innovation**: Without incentives or protections for original research, the domestic [[growth_of_indias_pharmaceutical_industry | Indian pharmaceutical industry]] did not invest significantly in R&D and produced few new drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

By the 1990s, some companies turned to the export market, with 40% of Indian drug production destined for export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. However, these were mostly low-value exports, as Indian companies were excluded from more lucrative markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## International Influence

In 1992, India signed the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), a major milestone that required India to amend its patent policies to align with international trade standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This meant recognizing product patents and granting exclusive marketing rights to new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This shift, which India was given until 2005 to implement, led to a monumental change in the industry, pushing it towards a new, more profitable model involving R&D, strategic collaborations, and mergers and acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This transition is further detailed in [[challenges_and_shifts_in_indias_pharmaceutical_sector_posttrips_agreement | Challenges and Shifts in India's Pharmaceutical Sector Post-TRIPS Agreement]].

Ironically, around the same time India was transitioning away from process-based patents due to TRIPS, other countries began to adopt similar process-based patent approaches, having observed how the Indian Patent Act of 1970 successfully lowered drug costs and challenged the dominance of multinational corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

The Patent Act of 1970 was a crucial factor in shaping the [[growth_of_indias_pharmaceutical_industry | Indian pharmaceutical industry]], demonstrating a market-driven reform spurred by adapting policies to suit the country's needs at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

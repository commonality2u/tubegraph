The [[the_creation_and_development_of_unix | creation and emergence of the operating system Unix]] was a significant moment in technology history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This article explores its rise and spread from an internal tool to a widely adopted platform in both academic and commercial sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Beginnings and Internal Spread
Initially, Unix was intended as an internal tool within Bell Labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. It developed from the efforts of scientists like Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Rudd Canaday, Doug McIlroy, and J.F. Ossanna, who continued work after Bell Labs pulled out of [[the_multics_project_and_its_impact_on_unix | the Multics project]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The early version, initially named "Unics" by Brian Kernighan, was seen as a convenient platform for software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

A key development was the implementation of a file system by Ken Thompson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, which abstracted away hardware differences and allowed users on any device to modify files, becoming one of Unix's "killer apps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. With the addition of a text editor and the "roff" typesetting markup language, Unix found a practical application in the Bell Labs Patent Department, leading to its widespread adoption across the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Factors Driving Unix's Popularity
Unix's unexpected popularity outside of Bell Labs can be attributed to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>:

*   **Humble Hardware Compatibility**
    Unix was born on relatively humble hardware, such as the PDP-11/40, which cost significantly less than mainframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This made it accessible to institutions with smaller budgets, allowing programmers to work with readily available equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

*   **Portability and Modifiability (C Language)**
    The Unix source code was written in "C," a higher-level programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie from Ken Thompson's "B" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This made Unix the first OS of its kind and far easier to program than low-level assembly language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Being written in C also made Unix easy to port to different hardware architectures and simpler to modify and enhance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

*   **The AT&T Consent Decree and Low Cost**
    Crucially, Unix was inexpensive to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Due to the 1956 AT&T Consent Decree, which settled an anti-trust lawsuit, AT&T was barred from entering the computer business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This decree mandated that AT&T make its inventions available to the academic community at no charge or under fair terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Consequently, AT&T and Bell Labs sold the Unix source code to nonprofits like universities for only a few hundred dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This was in stark contrast to other software companies that guarded their source code zealously and restricted modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

*   **Community Development**
    AT&T managers, wary of violating the Consent Decree, shied away from providing support to licensees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This lack of official support, paradoxically, encouraged university students and researchers to work together, implementing desired features themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. By the early 1970s, Unix had spread globally, running on university computers in Australia, the United Kingdom, Belgium, and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Berkeley Unix (BSD)
In November 1973, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie presented the first Unix paper, which UC Berkeley Professor Bob Fabry attended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Berkeley acquired a PDP minicomputer, and Ken Thompson himself joined as a visiting professor in 1975 to help install Unix Version 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

Students Chuck Haley and Bill Joy became instrumental in developing Berkeley's Unix variant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. They finished a Pascal implementation started by Thompson, known for its excellent error handling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. They also added utilities, including the "ex" (EXtended) text editor, which later evolved into "vim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

The Berkeley variant gained popularity, leading Bill Joy to assemble and distribute the first "Berkeley Software Distribution" (BSD) in early 1977, sending out 30 copies for about $50 per tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Subsequent versions followed, including 2BSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. In 1978, when DEC introduced the VAX-11/780, Bill Joy and Ozalp Babaoglu added crucial virtual memory support, releasing it as 3BSD in December 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This move solidified Berkeley's position as a leading hub for Unix releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

### DARPA and the Internet
BSD took another significant leap thanks to DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. In 1979, DARPA sought a "universal computing environment" to consolidate its diverse software and chose Unix due to its ability to handle different hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

In 1980, Bob Fabry received a contract from DARPA to add features to 3BSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. This led to the formation of the Computer Systems Research Group (CSRG) with Bill Joy, which coordinated a global network of volunteer contributors for the 4BSD (or BSD Unix) series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. A key feature of this new Unix was its support for DARPA's protocols, including those for the Internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Specifically, 4.2BSD fully supported the Internet protocol stack TCP/IP, playing a significant role in popularizing the Internet as we know it today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. The popularity of 4.2BSD was immense, with over a thousand licenses issued within a month of its April 1983 release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## Commercialization of Unix
The success of Unix in academic and research environments paved the way for its commercial adoption. Bill Joy, seeing the need for commercial growth, left CSRG in the summer of 1982 to co-found [[the_founding_and_early_growth_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

[[history_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] became famous for pioneering and popularizing the workstation computer, which combined the Unix OS with scientific/engineering applications, the Motorola 68000 microprocessor, and other off-the-shelf hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. [[history_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] later developed its own closed-source Unix variant, SunOS, branched off from 4.2BSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. These networked workstations became immensely valuable, leading [[history_of_sun_microsystems | Sun Microsystems]] to become one of the fastest-growing companies in Silicon Valley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

Other companies also commercialized Unix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>:
*   **Mt. Xinu**: A Berkeley-based software company that sold a commercially licensed version of BSD for DEC Vax minicomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
*   **Santa Cruz Operation (SCO)**: Sold Unix variants for x86 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Onyx Systems**: Marketed a Unix variant for Zilog-based Personal Computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Microsoft**: Developed Xenix, a Unix variant for 16-bit microcomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   **NeXT**: Steve Jobs' workstation computer startup, founded in 1985, whose operating system NeXTSTEP was derived from 4.3BSD Tahoe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

## Conclusion
Unix pioneered powerful concepts that helped transform software into the powerhouse industry it is today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>. Its early development was driven by individuals interested in technology rather than profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. However, as its community and potential grew, the work surrounding Unix transitioned into a commercial activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. The period around 1983 marked the end of Unix's "awkward growth years," setting the stage for future conflicts known as the Unix Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

The [[development_of_thermonuclear_weapons | hydrogen bomb]] is a staged thermonuclear weapon capable of immense destructive power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The United States developed the hydrogen bomb in response to the first Soviet atomic bomb test, with the Soviets having their own H-bomb just three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### The Super

The concept of a "Super" bomb originated in the early 1940s.

*   **Enrico Fermi**
    *   In September 1941, the famed Italian physicist **Enrico Fermi** presented an idea to Hungarian-American physicist **Edward Teller** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
    *   While lunching with Teller, Fermi pondered if the atomic bomb could be used to jump-start a deuterium weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Such a weapon would derive energy from fusing hydrogen into helium, releasing a much larger explosion than fission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

*   **Edward Teller**
    *   **Edward Teller**, whose role was played by Benny Safdie in the *Oppenheimer* movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, soon became obsessed with Fermi's idea and pushed for its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
    *   A team at Los Alamos began discussing the theories in the summer of 1942 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   Teller largely worked on his own, with occasional help from others, while most resources were focused on the A-bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
    *   In 1947, Teller published an article about the "superbomb" in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
    *   After World War II, Teller advocated for going "all in" with the thermonuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
    *   He and his team worked on solving the problem of delivering enough energy to deuterium to achieve fusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

*   **Tokutaro Hagiwara**
    *   Claims exist that a Japanese chemist, **Tokutaro Hagiwara** at the University of Kyoto, first conceived the idea in May 1941, though later translations suggest he was referring to something else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Classical Super Problems and Solutions

Early challenges with the "Classical Super" concept were identified.

*   **Emil Konopinski**
    *   Physicist **Emil Konopinski** suggested adding tritium, a different hydrogen isotope, to the deuterium mix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Tritium would act like "lighter fluid" for a campfire, enabling Deuterium-Tritium reactions to occur more easily than pure deuterium-deuterium reactions, which required hundreds of millions of degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

*   **Klaus Fuchs**
    *   In the spring of 1946, British scientist of German origin, **Klaus Fuchs**, joined the project after completing work on atomic bomb detonation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Fuchs had been an active participant in communist organizations since his youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   He made improvements to the Classical Super concept, suggesting that if fast-moving neutrons were crucial for fusion, encasing the deuterium-tritium mix in radiation-impervious cladding would keep more neutrons inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    *   This early conception of "radiation implosion" was later patented with John von Neumann <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a> and would be key to the final thermonuclear bomb design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   In June 1946, Fuchs left the Manhattan Project for Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. It was later discovered he had passed critical information on the atomic bomb's design and construction to the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   [[role_of_espionage_in_soviet_and_american_nuclear_programs | Fuchs' reports]] accelerated Soviet atomic bomb progress by 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
    *   In September 1947, Fuchs met with a Soviet intelligence officer, stating that Fermi and Teller were working on a superbomb in Chicago and that it was feasible, explaining some operating principles including the use of deuterium and tritium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
    *   In March 1948, Fuchs provided documents detailing the American superbomb design with its radiation jacket to his intelligence handler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. These documents became the basis for the Soviet "Tube" design or RDS-6t <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

*   **John von Neumann**
    *   Co-patented the early conception of radiation implosion with Klaus Fuchs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Soviet Contributions

The Soviets, spurred by intelligence and a desire to catch up, also made significant contributions.

*   **Igor Kurchatov (Игорь Васильевич Курчатов)**
    *   As the scientific director of the Soviet nuclear program, **Igor Kurchatov** received a memo in September 1945 exploring the idea of using atomic explosion heat to produce helium from hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

    *   In December 1945, his group confirmed the possibility of a nuclear fusion bomb in a document titled "Utilization of the nuclear energy of light elements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
    *   In November 1947, his group proposed propagating a massive shock wave through a mix of deuterium, tritium, and lithium as a thermonuclear fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
    *   Zeldovich and his team moved to KB-11 in Sarov to continue their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
    *   His team's RDS-6s design was authorized for prototype development by May 1952 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
    *   He eventually agreed that Sakharov's "Sloika" (Layer Cake) design had the most potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

*   **Niels Bohr**
    *   **Niels Bohr**, played by Kenneth Branagh in *Oppenheimer* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, was questioned by the Soviets about a "superbomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
    *   He expressed skepticism, questioning if it meant a heavier bomb (unreasonable) or a bomb made of a new substance (unreal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

*   **Igor Tamm (И́горь Евге́ньевич Тамм)**
    *   **Igor Tamm**, an esteemed theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate, was asked by Kurchatov to check Zeldovich's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
    *   He agreed, believing the Soviet Union needed nuclear weapons despite misgivings about its leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
    *   He recruited a group of young physicists, including **Andrei Sakharov** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
    *   Tamm and his colleagues did not like Zeldovich's design and began developing their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
    *   He agreed that the Sloika design had the most potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

    *   A theoretical expert recruited by Igor Tamm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
    *   By 1948, **Andrei Sakharov** developed a promising design called the "First Idea," without access to Fuchs' documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.
    *   His design, eventually named RDS-6s, was called "Sloika" (Layer Cake) due to its layered structure of uranium and thermonuclear fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
    *   He is associated with "Sakharov's Third Idea" (radiation implosion), which aligned with the American Teller-Ulam design, though he was not the sole originator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

*   **Vitalii Ginzburg**
    *   **Vitalii Ginzburg** suggested including lithium deuteride in Sakharov's design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
    *   He pointed out that lithium, when bombarded by neutrons, could create more tritium, providing additional fuel for the fusion explosion. This became known as the "Second Idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

*   **J. Robert Oppenheimer**
    *   After the war, **Oppenheimer** was skeptical about the technical feasibility of the classical Super concept, correctly so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

*   **Viktor Davidenko**
    *   A lab director, **Viktor Davidenko**, repeatedly espoused the idea of using compression to heat thermonuclear fuel to millions of degrees to trigger a fusion reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

### Political Figures

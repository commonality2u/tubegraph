The genesis of modern microelectronics is marked by December 16th, 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, the "zero hour" for the microelectronics technology timeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This date signifies the creation of the first transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, a pivotal "game changer" and the cornerstone for all contemporary technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Its discovery, driven by research for radios, radars, and telephones, led to [[the_transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_solidstate_devices | the overthrow of the vacuum tube]] and ushered in the modern computing era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Beginnings: The Quest for a Vacuum Tube Replacement

AT&T and Bell Labs had a long-standing desire to replace the vacuum tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Vacuum tubes, such as the triode, were initially developed for radio, TV, and telecommunications, valued for their ability to rectify and amplify signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. While the tube was fundamental to AT&T's extensive telephone infrastructure, it also posed significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a single transcontinental phone call required 12,300 vacuum tubes, primarily as amplifiers to regenerate weakened signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. These tubes were large, costly, and prone to burning out, negatively impacting customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

By the 1930s, AT&T sought a more reliable alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. William Shockley, who joined Bell Labs' Vacuum Tube Department in 1936, was a key scientist in this pursuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Early pre-war research focused on copper-oxide rectifiers, which convert AC power to DC for stable telephone power supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. A Bell Labs scientist noted the similarity between how these rectifiers worked and how vacuum tubes amplified signals, prompting the question of whether rectifiers could function as amplifiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. William Brattain and Joseph Becker were tasked with modifying rectifier behavior to emulate vacuum tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. However, these initial experiments were unsuccessful due to a lack of proper physics grounding and the use of impure semiconducting materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Purer materials were needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## War: Catalyzing Semiconductor Purity

World War II significantly advanced semiconductor research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Shockley himself served in anti-submarine research and oversaw radar system deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Initially, the United States lagged behind the British in solid-state physics related to semiconductor technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. However, the immense resources America invested into wartime semiconductor research, including 30 to 40 laboratories dedicated to radar, made a crucial difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

The most impactful work involved very pure germanium and silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. In 1942, a Purdue University team led by Professor Karl Lark-Horovitz received a US government grant to produce point contact crystal rectifiers, also known as "cat's whisker" detectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These detectors involved pressing a thin metal wire against a semiconducting material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. While advantageous for radar, especially at microwave wavelengths, the cat's whisker often burned out due to impurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This led the team to focus on producing extremely pure germanium and silicon crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. A single grad student, working with Eagle-Picher Company, successfully turned byproduct germanium into pure ingots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Before the war, silicon purity was around 99%; afterwards, companies like DuPont achieved 99.999% pure silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Bell Labs' wartime focus on radar also spurred significant progress in semiconductor research and production, from silicon diodes to point contacts for radar detectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This period of [[challenges_and_breakthroughs_in_early_semiconductor_research | breakthroughs in semiconductor research]] was critical.

## Post-War: The Prediction of the Field Effect Transistor

After the war, in spring 1945, Mervin Kelly became Bell Labs' director of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Recognizing Bell Labs' leading position in solid-state physics, Kelly formed interdisciplinary research groups, including electrical engineers, chemists, experimentalists, and theorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. William Shockley, fresh from his wartime contributions, co-headed one of these groups, overseeing Walter Brattain and John Bardeen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

A visit to Purdue in September 1945 convinced Shockley's team that silicon and germanium were the best material candidates, favoring germanium due to its lower melting temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. In January 1946, Shockley predicted that applying a strong external electrical field to a thin layer of silicon or germanium could modulate its conductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This "field effect" could enable a three-terminal device, similar to the vacuum tube triode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. In such a device, a low-current signal sent to a third terminal could modulate the semiconductor's conductivity, amplifying a larger current passing through the other two terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This would create a solid-state amplifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Alternatively, a strong enough signal could act as a gate, switching current flow on or off, creating a switch for binary 1s and 0s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Shockley set out to prove this "field effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## An Experiment: The Birth of the Point Contact Transistor

Shockley's field effect experiments, conducted by his cohorts, were not yielding expected results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. John Bardeen, the brilliant theorist, and Walter Brattain, a great experimentalist, worked together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. When the observed modulation was far less than predicted, Bardeen theorized that the electrical field was being blocked at the surface of the semiconducting material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

To test this, Bardeen and Brattain began probing the germanium surface with two wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. After many experiments, Bardeen suggested placing the two probes very closely together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Brattain achieved this by cementing a gold foil onto a polystyrene triangle with a narrow, flat edge, then carefully cutting the gold in two at the apex with a razor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

On December 16th, 1947, they set up the experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Brattain recalled wiggling the triangle until he had contact with both ends of the gold, allowing one contact to act as an emitter and the other a collector, resulting in an amplifier with approximately 100 times amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. With this simple setup, Brattain and Bardeen had created their solid-state amplifier, strengthening a small signal many times over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This breakthrough, [[the_development_and_impact_of_the_point_contact_transistor | the point contact transistor]], was immediately recognized for its significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## Keeping a Secret: The Transistor's Public Debut

The team quickly integrated the device into a circuit and, a week later, demonstrated it to AT&T leadership, who listened to amplified speech through headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. AT&T kept the discovery secret for several months to patent the design and presented it to the US military, who considered classifying it as a "Manhattan Project"-like venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Fortunately, its widespread applications prevented classification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The news broke on June 30th, 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The New York Times dryly described the transistor as having "applications in radio where a vacuum tube ordinarily is employed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## The Point Contact Transistor: Limitations and Accidental Nature

The announcement sparked a massive global surge in solid-state physics research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. While historically important, the [[the_development_and_impact_of_the_point_contact_transistor | point contact transistor]]'s discovery was largely accidental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, and the team had been pursuing a different goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. At the time, the underlying physics of its amplification were unclear, remaining so even a decade later when Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley received their Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

Commercially, the point contact transistor failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Western Electric, Bell Labs' sister company, began major production in 1951, aiming to replace all vacuum tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. By 1952, they produced 8,400 devices monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. However, challenges arose: its operation depended on fragile semiconductor surface structures, making it highly susceptible to humidity and temperature, leading to inconsistent performance and hindering its commercial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

## The Junction: Shockley's Triumph

Fortunately, the point contact transistor was not the only type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. William Shockley, excluded from the point contact experiment, felt competitive and frustrated, intensifying his theoretical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. He recognized the point contact transistor's weak commercial prospects and underdeveloped theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

While Bardeen and Brattain were demonstrating their device, Shockley was furiously working on his own concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. On January 23rd, he unified existing concepts with observations from the transistor discovery to create the **junction transistor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

The junction transistor consists of three sections of two types of differently "doped" semiconducting materials: p-type (with an abundance of "electron holes") and n-type (with an abundance of electrons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. These can be arranged as N-P-N or P-N-P, with the "base" always in the middle, acting as a gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. The meeting points of these materials are called "junctions," giving the device its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

Shockley's critical realization was that at these junctions, the majority charge carrier (electron or electron hole) could travel across the two junctions from emitter to collector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. This "minority carrier injection" meant the current flowed through the entire semiconducting material, penetrating its surface, rather than just along the surface layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. This concept was key to a far more resilient and commercially useful device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. By manipulating the current into the base, a much larger current flowing through the base could be controlled, allowing for signal amplification or switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

Initially, Shockley kept his idea secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. However, in February 1948, Bell Labs physicist John Shive's experimental point contact transistor results showed electron holes moving through the entire germanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. Shockley saw this as proof of his minority carrier injection concept, paving the way for a better transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

Later, in 1950, Bell Labs chemists Gordon Teal and Morgan Sparks adopted the Czochralski process to grow long, narrow crystals of very pure germanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. This method, still used today for modern wafers, involves systematically dipping a small seed crystal into a melt to grow a larger one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. By alternately doping the germanium crystal with P and N-type impurities, Teal and Sparks created P-N junctions, leading to Bell Labs' first "grown junction transistors" in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The junction transistor, a sturdy three-part "sandwich" not reliant on fragile wires touching the surface, was immediately recognized as a superior commercial product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

Shockley, through his own work, had "crafted an entirely new page of semiconductor physics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Bardeen, who had been working with Shockley, missed the concepts behind minority carrier injection, dismissing P-N junctions as high-resistance barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. Shockley's book, "Electrons and Holes in Semiconductor," cemented his status as the leading figure in transistor theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. Though difficult to work with, Shockley acknowledged that Bardeen and Brattain discovered the first transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

## Transistor Explosion and Commercialization

In 1949, an antitrust lawsuit against AT&T led to a Consent Decree requiring them to license their discoveries, including the transistor, to other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. For $25,000, domestic and foreign companies could buy a patent license, gaining access to symposia and an "800-page book" with samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

Former vacuum tube companies like RCA, General Electric, Westinghouse, and Sylvania recognized the threat and aggressively built up germanium transistor capacity, innovating new improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. In 1951 or 1952, General Electric and RCA discovered the "alloy junction transistor," a more scalable manufacturing method involving melting indium and other pellets with germanium to create junctions, avoiding the complexities of doping crystals during growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

By 1953, the first transistorized products entered the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>, including the revolutionary transistorized hearing aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. News of the transistor spread globally, leading to rapid development in other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. France developed its "transistron" by scientists Welker and Matare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>, and Japan's Electrotechnical Laboratory produced its first point contact transistor in 1951 and junction transistor in 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. Japan's Sony Corporation famously commercialized the transistor radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. Leo Esaki, a researcher there, won the 1973 Nobel Prize for his work on electron tunneling in semiconductor materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. This marked the beginning of [[the_commercialization_and_global_impact_of_transistors_in_technology | the commercialization and global impact of transistors]].

## Transistors in Computers

From its inception, the transistor was anticipated for use in computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Replacing the thousands of vacuum tubes in 1950s computers with transistors promised smaller, more energy-efficient, cooler, and more reliable devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.

Despite initial delays in scaling reliable transistor production due to cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a> (a 1953 hearing aid with one transistor cost $229 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>), progress was swift. In November 1953, the University of Manchester fired up a computer containing 92 first-generation point contact transistors, generally considered the first transistorized computer, though it still used tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. Bell Labs and other companies, spurred by military demand, poured resources into improving transistor reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. The commercialization of the improved alloy junction transistor and variants like Philco's "surface-barrier transistor" paved the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

In May 1954, the U.S. Air Force received TRADIC (TRAnsistor DIgital Computer), the first American transistorized computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. With 700 transistors, it tested the feasibility of digital navigation computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. Within a decade, the transistor evolved from a fragile lab curiosity to a component enabling flying computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. Transistorized computers marked a clear line, defining them as second-generation devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

Near the end of 1954, Bill Shockley resigned from Bell Labs to start his own business, joining Arnold Beckman's Semiconductor Lab within Beckman Instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. By 1955, Bell Labs' dominance in transistor patents began to decline as former vacuum tube companies aggressively entered the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. Shockley moved to California, marking a new chapter in the ongoing story of semiconductor development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

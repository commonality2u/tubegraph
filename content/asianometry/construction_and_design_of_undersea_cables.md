Undersea cables serve as the essential backbone of our global communications network, carrying gigabits of information and enabling much of our hyper-connected world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Despite their critical role, these cables traverse dangerous environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Beginnings and Early Protection Methods [[history_of_undersea_cables]]

Early attempts at underwater cabling faced challenges due to the harsh marine environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The first underwater experiments in 1811 involved German polymath Samuel Thomas von SÃ¶mmerring, who wrapped a telegraph cable in rubber to cross a river for Bavaria's first telegraph network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This attempt failed as rubber, a water-absorbent vegetable protein, allowed water to reach the copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

A few years later, in 1838, Irish physician and telegraph pioneer Dr. William Brooke O'Shaughnessy developed a new method to prevent water leakage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This involved wrapping the wire in rattan (a palm material) and then in tar-covered yarn, successfully sealing the cable from river water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

In 1845, the Brett Brothers proposed laying a telegraph cable from Dover, England, to Calais, France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. They wrapped a half-inch thick telegraph cable in gutta percha, an inert organic plastic sourced from Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This cable was laid in 1850 but, being unprotected and weighted only by a few lead bricks, performed poorly and failed the next morning, reportedly cut by a French fisherman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

For their next attempt, railway engineer Thomas Russell Crampton devised a scheme to wrap the cable in steel wire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This design, deployed in 1851, performed well for several years and established a model for virtually every submarine cable since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Cable Construction and Materials [[history_of_undersea_cables]]

The general model for undersea cables involves one or several copper wires at the core, wrapped in gutta percha insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The first trans-Atlantic telegraph cable, laid in 1866, was 2,500 miles long and had three layers of gutta percha wrapped around it, using over 300 tons of the material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Gutta percha was eventually replaced by polyethylene plastic in the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Around the core and insulation, there is a cushioning layer, followed by the armoring steel wires, a concept pioneered by Crampton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. To prevent bacteria in tropical waters from consuming the gutta percha, cable makers sometimes applied powdered silica or brass tape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Modern Cable Design [[modern_advancements_in_undersea_cable_technology]]

As communication technologies advanced, so did the cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Telegraph cables evolved into telephone cables, with repeaters added in the 1940s to boost and improve signal quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The introduction of optic fiber in the 1980s vastly increased the data bandwidth these cables could carry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. While tweaks were made for new changes and environments, the main setup remains consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Several cable variants exist:
*   **Lightweight Cables** These are the industry's workhorse, featuring steel wires and polyethylene wound around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. They are best suited for safe and stable shallow waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Lightweight Protective Cables** These add more polyethylene and steel tape layers, primarily to combat animals and chafing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Single-Armored Cables** A lightweight cable with a single layer of steel wire and polyethylene wrapping, providing extra protection where the risk of cable-cutting is higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Double-Armored Cables** These "beefy" cables feature two armoring layers of galvanized steel wires wound around the exterior of a standard lightweight cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. They are deployed in shallow waters with high traffic or when the cable cannot be buried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Laying and Connecting Cables [[challenges_of_subsea_cable_installation]]

Undersea cables are typically laid from a boat carrying several thousand tons of cable in a cable tank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The cable travels from the tank through a path of rollers called a "cable highway" to the Linear Cable Engine, which handles the actual laying or retrieval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The cable undergoes intense tension during this process, so ship operators continuously check its quality and integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

For long cables, repeater stations are added every 60 to 80 kilometers to amplify and restore the signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

Connecting segments of cable is a delicate process known as "jointing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This involves carefully preparing the cable ends, splicing them, and then re-encapsulating the splice in polyethylene and armor to achieve 90% of the original strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

## Protection Measures [[protection_and_security_measures_for_undersea_cables]]

The most effective way to protect a cable is to dig a deep trench, place the cable within, and cover it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Since excavation equipment cannot be used underwater, this is achieved using high-pressure water jets or specialized underwater trenching machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. The burial depth typically does not exceed 2 meters, but deeper burial is required if the seabed is particularly soft to prevent damage from anchors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. An older "Burial Protection Index" from the late 1990s is now considered outdated, with integrators relying on their own risk assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

When the ground is too hard for trenching, alternatives exist:
*   **Riprap (Rock Armor)** This involves laying smaller rocks over the cable, followed by larger rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Riprap is most effective in calm water currents where the rocks remain undisturbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   **Cover Plates or Casing Pipes** These are shells that encase the cable, and can be further protected with riprap if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

Despite the advanced engineering for protection against natural hazards, a determined attacker can still easily cut a cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Therefore, protection often relies on security through obscuration, depth, trenches, and riprap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Undersea cables continue to carry the majority of the world's internet and telephone traffic, making their protection critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

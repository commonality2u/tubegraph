In 1989, Bulgaria exported more computers than all other Eastern Bloc countries combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It was the only COMECON country producing hard disk drive memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, and its electronics industry was a significant export force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. More than 11% of all Bulgarian workers were employed in computer and electronics production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The nation produced some of the world's first electronic calculators and personal computers, many of which became iconic brands in Southeastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Bulgaria aspired to emulate Japan's economic success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This article explores the remarkable rise and eventual fall of this industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Beginnings

Bulgaria, a middle-sized country in Southeastern Europe, was established as the Third Bulgarian State in 1878 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Initially, it was a relatively poor, largely agricultural economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. During World War II, Bulgaria sided with the Axis powers, leading to the Soviet Union's intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The Bulgarian Communist Party subsequently overthrew the czarist government, abolished the monarchy, and established the People's Republic of Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The Party then rebuilt the country, modeling its economic policies after the Soviet Union, which provided loans, raw materials, and purchased Bulgarian finished goods at generous terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## [[Todor Zhivkov|Todor Zhivkov]]

After Stalin's death in 1953, [[Todor Zhivkov]] assumed leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, a position he held for 35 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. His relatively moderate rule brought unprecedented political and economic stability to the People's Republic of Bulgaria until its end in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The Party's economic policy focused on producing machinery and tools for heavy industry sectors like mining, energy, and metallurgy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Zhivkov greatly admired the Japanese economy and sought to emulate its development path, identifying heavy industry and electronics as Japan's top two sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

> "...that's what I've been dreaming about for years. Those who have interacted with me know that electronics was my weakness... I saw it as our future." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>

## The Bulgarian Computer Gap

In the 1950s, Bulgarian scientists began studying Soviet cybernetics and the economic potential of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Other countries, including the Soviet Union (whose MESM computer started in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>), East Germany (ZRA-1 completed in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>), Czechoslovakia, Romania (both in 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>), Hungary (1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>), and Poland (1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>), had already started building their own computers. Bulgaria lagged behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Catch-up efforts were hindered by Western export restrictions imposed by the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), established in 1950, which prevented Soviet allies like Bulgaria from acquiring high-tech industrial tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Computing Center

In 1956, Bulgarian professor and mathematician Ljubomir Iliev attended a conference in Moscow, which discussed the mathematical foundations of computing and cybernetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The Soviet delegation recommended that all socialist countries establish their own computing centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Professor Iliev conveyed this message to the Mathematical Institute within the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The government responded positively, raising funds and recruiting staff over the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. In 1961, the Council of Ministers approved the creation of a new computing center, renamed the Mathematical Institute with Computing Institute (ИМ с ИЦ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Vitosha

At the beginning of 1962, Professor Iliev's team began work on the Vitosha (Витоша), Bulgaria's first digital computer, completed in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Modeled after one of Romania's CIFA computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, Vitosha was 4 meters long and 2 meters tall, containing about 1,500 vacuum tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. It had a magnetic drum memory storing 4,096 40-bit "words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. During operations, it consumed 12 kilowatts of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Data and programs were input via tape punch, and results, processed at 2,000 operations per second, were output by an electrical typewriter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Vitosha was demonstrated at the "Bulgaria Builds Socialism" exhibition in Moscow, solving math equations and presenting graphical information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Sadly, the computer was ruined by a burst hot water pipe and dismantled for scrap after its return to Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## ELKA and More

Despite Vitosha's demise, its success at the Moscow exhibition garnered political support for further computer development in Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. The Bulgarian government agreed to import a Minsk 2 computer from the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, a decision Professor Iliev opposed, advocating for domestic production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The arrival of the Minsk 2 in 1964 dissuaded plans for a larger Vitosha-style computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Around the same time, the chairmen of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and Mechanical Engineering Committee identified electronics as a profitable export industry for Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. They noted its labor-intensive nature (especially for cheaper female labor) and low raw material requirements, combined with high potential returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The Council of Ministers agreed, allocating resources and even capitalist currencies for the industry, led by Professor Ivan Popov, chairman of Bulgaria's State Committee for Science and Technical Progress (DKNTP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Popov

Professor Ivan Popov is widely considered the founder and main driving force of Bulgaria's computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. A natural entrepreneur, he was a hardcore patriot who believed in modern technology for Bulgaria's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

In late 1964, Popov presented Professor Iliev and the Mathematics Institute with a Sumlock ANITA calculator, the world's first all-electronic calculator, tasking them to produce their own version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. A small team reverse-engineered the ANITA. Lacking the necessary Dekatron vacuum tubes from the Soviet Bloc, they brilliantly re-engineered the design to use transistors instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

### Meet ELKA

This effort resulted in the ELKA (ЕЛКА) 6521, short for "electronic calculator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The 8.5 kg ELKA used Germanium transistors and could perform square roots, integer division, and averaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. It was one of the first transistorized, all-electronic desktop calculators of its era, comparable to the American Friden EC-130, Italian IME 84, and Japanese Sharp CS-10A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

In April 1965, the ELKA 6521 was demonstrated to [[Todor Zhivkov]] and the Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. With their approval, it was exhibited at the INFORGA-65 show in Moscow the following month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### Selling ELKA

At the INFORGA-65 show, Ivan Popov, fluent in multiple languages, sought a high-volume five-year sales contract from the Soviet Gosplan (state planning committee) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Popov bluffed, claiming Bulgarian scientists had achieved a breakthrough and that large-scale factories were already established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Although a plant was being set up in Sofia, it wasn't ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The Russians did not buy the ELKA-6521 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

In 1966, the team simplified the design, creating the smaller and cheaper ELKA-22, and the ELKA-25 with a printer, likely the first of its kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Popov again presented the new models to Gosplan, asking 1,200 roubles per ELKA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. When Gosplan noted East Germany offered their calculators for 730 roubles, Popov cut his price to 700, securing the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. East Germany later exited the electronic calculator business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

In 1967, Bulgaria established DSO IZOT, an industrial conglomerate for calculating machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. From 1967 to 1984, IZOT generated over 11 billion leva in export revenues, equivalent to roughly $10 million USD in 1967 dollars, with profits of 6.4 billion leva <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Exports went to the Soviet Union and outside the Bloc to Switzerland and Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. The ELKA-42, an integrated circuit-based electronic calculator, was notably displayed at the Osaka World Expo in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. ELKA later diversified into IC-powered cash registers, exporting thousands to Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## [[Bulgarian innovation in electronics and semiconductors|Bulgarian Semiconductors]]

Bulgaria's rapid catch-up in electronics was partly due to its growing semiconductor capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Concurrently with IZOT's founding, the Bulgarian government established the Institute of Microelectronics, with a design house in Sofia and a production fab in Botevgrad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Led by the renowned physicist Yordan Kasabov, a microelectronics pioneer who had produced the country's first domestic MOS transistors the year prior, the Institute rapidly advanced Bulgaria's semiconductor capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Kasabov designed and helped manufacture the IC for the ELKA-42 using modern processes like photolithography and ion implantation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

Around 1972-1973, Kasabov and Lubomir Antonov visited Silicon Valley, observing the rapid growth of the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. They recognized the power of highly integrated ICs, such as an AMD 4-bit IC they saw, and resolved to create similar technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Upon their return, they produced microprocessors like the CM-400, enabling the creation of advanced 4-chip calculators like the ELKA-50 series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

## Unified System

In 1969, the Soviet Bloc countries decided to collaboratively produce a "Unified System of Computers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Concerned about the COMECON's slow coordination, Professor Ivan Popov and his Soviet colleagues established the Intergovernmental Commission on Computing Technology (IGCCT) to move faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. As a founder, Popov ensured Bulgaria played a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

The IGCCT assigned 105 production items to individual countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. Thanks to Popov, Bulgaria was assigned three of the most valuable items: memory disks, magnetic memory tapes, and a processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Popov secured technology transfer agreements with Western companies, such as Fujitsu for memory tape design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, and copied others, like IBM's disk drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. To establish this monopoly, Popov rapidly coordinated the simultaneous construction of seven new plants for various components, pushing construction teams to complete them quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

> I had the chance to participate in the selection of sites for the new plants and when he was giving orders to the industrial architects: "I need halls 12 meters high with all the communications underground (electricity, water, etc.). And we need it in six months!" The architects often asked about what he needed these premises for, but Ivan Popov instead joked – "I will grow chickens". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>

The export of these high-technology systems was highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Bulgaria negotiated a monopoly, selling products like hard disk drives at very high prices, as no other Eastern Bloc country manufactured them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Bulgarian factories produced goods at large scale and high quality, acquiring advanced equipment from Europe and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Margins were nearly 200-300% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Along with a favorable Soviet oil re-export deal, these electronics exports sustained the Bulgarian economy throughout the volatile 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

## Popov's Exit

Ivan Popov's blunt nature and poor political skills ultimately led to his downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. In 1974, during debates for a new Five Year Plan, Popov proposed building mainframes in direct competition with the Soviet Union and East Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. His refusal to compromise, even when pressed by [[Todor Zhivkov]], led to his removal from the Politburo and banishment as ambassador to Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

In its later years, during the second half of the 1980s, IZOT successfully ventured into supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. All geological centers in the Soviet Union were powered by Bulgarian computers like the IZOT-1014, which were sophisticated enough to impress even Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. By 1988, Bulgaria was exporting them to countries like India seeking alternatives to American supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

## Microcomputers

Throughout the 1970s, Bulgaria produced mainframes and minicomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. More notably, Bulgaria was an early entrant into the personal computing boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. In 1979, microelectronics engineer Ivan Marangozov joined the Institute of Technical Cybernetics and Robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. His team successfully copied an imported Apple II computer, producing an almost identical clone, even with the same ROM (minus a name change) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Key differences included a Cyrillic keyboard and reliance on slow tape cassette memory instead of floppy disk drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

This Apple II clone was named IMKO-1 (Индивидуален микро компютър (ИМКО-1)), meaning "Individual Micro Computer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. A limited run of at least 50 units was extremely popular and functional. The IMKO-1 was demonstrated at an international robotics exhibition in England, successfully controlling a robot arm as effectively as much more expensive minicomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

### Pravetz

The IMKO-1 served as a demo for a mass-produced version, the IMKO-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. For cost reasons, the IMKO-2 was modeled on the cheaper Apple IIe PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. It utilized a Synertek 6502 CPU (a MOS 6502 clone) and offered an optional floppy drive and a BASIC interpreter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Production moved to a new factory in Pravetz, [[Todor Zhivkov]]'s hometown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. The commercial version was named Pravetz-82, for its production start year, 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

Though still too expensive for the average Bulgarian, Pravetz PCs became reasonably accessible and quite popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. Production scaled significantly, from 500 units in 1983 to 18,000 two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Many schools purchased these PCs, and many Bulgarians learned programming on a Pravetz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. By 1987, Bulgaria had over 500 computer clubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. Pravetz produced various 8-bit and 16-bit variants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. At its peak, the Pravetz factory produced about 60,000 computers annually, largely exported to the Soviet Union, other COMECON countries, and even some Western nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## [[Challenges and missed opportunities in the Bulgarian electronics industry|Missed Opportunity]]

By the late 1970s, against all odds, Bulgaria was among the top 10 electronics manufacturing countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. However, troubles emerged. In the 1970s, the Bulgarian government ceased investing in microelectronics, possibly due to economic priorities on military and heavy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This halted the growth of Bulgaria's semiconductor industry, hindering its competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. For instance, while the Institute of Microelectronics developed a powerful IC for pocket calculators, the fab could not produce it, forcing IZOT to import foreign chips for its ELKA-100 series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. These imported chips cost precious foreign currency, making Bulgarian products more expensive than Japanese and Western alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

A technology collaboration with a Western company appeared to be the only solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. Lubomir Antonov's memoirs recall a visit from the American company Rockwell to Sofia, likely after 1980, to discuss a semiconductor technology collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>. A deal was struck, but at the last moment, a member of State Security intervened, declaring the contract would not be signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Years later, Antonov learned that [[The impact of Soviet influence on Bulgarias technology sector|Soviet Union authorities believed the deal would bring Bulgaria too close to the United States]], harming Soviet interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This was a devastating blow to the Bulgarian semiconductor industry, ensuring sophisticated Bulgarian computers would always rely on imported chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

## Decline

By 1988, the Bulgarian computer industry employed over 169,000 people, roughly 12% of the country's labor force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. However, times were changing. In 1989, [[Todor Zhivkov]] lost power following a botched assimilation drive against the ethnic Turkish minority, widespread opposition to his long rule, and the loss of Soviet support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. He resigned in November 1989 after 35 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.

In 1990, the Bulgarian electronics industry employed 181,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. However, the Soviet Union began to collapse the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. As 95% of Bulgaria's electronics revenue came from within the Soviet Bloc, with the USSR as the largest market, the loss of this customer was catastrophic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. Furthermore, since many of the industry's products were derived from Western designs, the collapse of the Soviet market left Bulgaria with no alternative buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. The industry also suffered from its dependence on Western-sourced critical goods, which constituted 30-40% of computer components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. As Bulgaria's currency weakened throughout the 1980s, these imports became prohibitively expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.

Finally, the early 1990s saw the opening of Bulgaria's markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. Extremely cheap South Korean and Taiwanese PCs flooded the market, causing demand for Pravetz PCs to plummet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. The factories closed down in 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. The once-formidable Bulgarian computer industry collapsed almost instantly, with employment crashing from nearly 200,000 to just 30,000 people within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

Bulgaria's connection to the Soviet Union was a double-edged sword <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.

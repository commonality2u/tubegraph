Once employing 100,000 people and producing tens of thousands of vehicles for domestic use and export, the Australian automobile industry has largely vanished, with the last major factory closing in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article explores the rise, decline, and fall of Australia's automotive manufacturing industry.

## Post-War Genesis and Growth

Emerging from World War II, the Australian government prioritized rebuilding its economy and nurturing manufacturing capacity, specifically focusing on car manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. They offered foreign companies subsidies and tax concessions to encourage production on Australian soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Manufacturers like Volkswagen, British Motors Leyland, and Ford entered the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

A notable success was GM-Holden, the Australian subsidiary of the American automaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. In 1948, GM-Holden produced the first "all-Australian car," the Holden, manufactured in Melbourne <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This rugged car was uniquely suited for Australia's rural areas and dominated the market throughout the 1950s, with waiting lists stretching for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. By 1951, Holden sold over 25,000 units and was the country's most profitable publicly traded company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Australian cars, particularly rugged vehicles like the Holden Ute (pickup trucks), became a fixture of the national culture, valued for their perceived resilience against odds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

This domestic manufacturing industry, which included other successes like Pope Industries (washing machines, fridges) and Meadows (cooking appliances), grew within a protected market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. High tariffs ensured guaranteed demand for domestic employers, who could then afford to pay a "fair and reasonable basic wage," supported by strong trade unions and a unique compulsory arbitration system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Local auto manufacturing also supported a local auto parts ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### Foreign Ownership and Its Implications

Despite the local cultural significance, none of the Australian carmaker companies were actually owned by Australians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This foreign ownership had both upsides and downsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. On the one hand, Australia's car-making industry benefited from being part of larger globalized networks, allowing Australian-made auto components to be produced at scale and exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. On the other hand, the companies were not deeply embedded locally, with profits flowing to foreign headquarters, and the foreign executives lacked emotional attachment to Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This meant Australia did not control its own automaking destiny, a situation that would later contribute to the [[challenges_faced_by_the_australian_car_industry | challenges faced by the Australian car industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Decline and Policy Shifts (1970s-2000s)

By the early 1970s, the domestic automotive manufacturing industry employed over 100,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. However, the decade saw a substantial loss of competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Automakers were producing too many models (five companies producing up to 15) with small production runs (as small as 25,000 units), leading to a lack of economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Australian cars, though rugged, were increasingly out of touch with the majority urban population's needs, creating a market gap for smaller, more efficient cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

This gap was filled by high-quality, low-cost Japanese imports like the Datsun (made by Nissan), which gained a significant foothold despite existing tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Government Reforms and Economic Shocks

The 1972 election of the Whitlam government marked a turning point in [[government_policies_and_the_automotive_industry | government policies and the automotive industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Not favoring foreign multinational-owned carmakers, and concerned about rising inflation, the government sought to liberalize trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. In 1973, a controversial abrupt 25% reduction in all tariffs on imported goods was implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This confrontational tactic led GM-Holden to fire 5,000 workers, sparking a political crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

The year 1973 also brought the OPEC oil embargo and the collapse of the Bretton Woods monetary regime, ending post-war prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Soaring oil prices spurred sales of gas-sipping alternatives, particularly small and medium four-cylinder cars dominated by Japanese imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. While large six-cylinder car sales remained flat, their share of the overall market collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This illustrates a "disruptive innovation" process, where upstart foreign companies gained market share and relentlessly moved upmarket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

Japanese automakers like Toyota and Nissan also set up domestic Australian assembly operations to avoid tariffs, further bloating the domestic market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. By the late 1970s, thousands of jobs were lost, and British Motors Leyland closed its Australian operations in 1975, cutting 2,600 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. The government reimposed import quotas in 1974-1975 to stem the bleeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

A key missing ingredient was a coordinating government entity, similar to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), to guide the industry's transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The four remaining domestic OEMs struggled to navigate this new competitive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. The [[impact_of_global_trade_on_australian_car_production | impact of global trade on Australian car production]] also saw a collapse in automobile exports; from 60,000 units in 1970, exports dwindled to just a few hundred by 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### The Button Plan and Further Contraction

The mid-1980s saw new [[government_policies_and_the_automotive_industry | government policies and the automotive industry]] changes, including banking sector deregulation and floating the Australian dollar, aiming to reorient manufacturing towards exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Prime Minister Hawke criticized past tariffs for creating "inefficient industries that could not compete overseas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

The "new car plan," introduced in late 1983 by Senator John Button, offered credits and subsidies for Australian-made cars and temporary government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. However, it also rapidly reduced import tariffs from 57.5% to 45% by 1988, with further reductions planned until 2000, and removed import quotas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. The intention was to slim down the domestic industry into a leaner, more competitive entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

The shrinking part of the plan went as expected: Ford lost $60 million in 1992 and laid off thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. The 1980s and 1990s saw plant closures by all domestic automakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Unexpectedly, Australian-made cars became even less competitive, as domestic carmakers responded by cutting costs and reducing investment in R&D and manufacturing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Foreign companies had primarily entered the Australian market to bypass trade protections, and when these vanished, their incentive to maintain expensive manufacturing operations dwindled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

## Final Stages and Collapse

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, domestic assembly stabilized at around 350,000 units annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. However, with population and economic growth, the domestic makers' market share continued to shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This occurred despite significant government support, including the Automotive Competitive and Investment Scheme (ACIS), which cost the Australian government $7 billion AUD from 2001 to 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

The mining boom starting in 2000, fueled by demand from China and India, caused a dramatic appreciation of the Australian dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. The dollar doubled in value over 10 years, reaching parity with the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. While seemingly positive, a stronger currency significantly increased the cost of Australian automotive production, leading to chronic losses for the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. From 2003 to 2010, the industry lost 25,000 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

In April 2004, Mitsubishi announced the closure of its engine and assembly plants in southern Adelaide, resulting in 1,167 job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Despite federal and state government assistance for the region and retrenched workers, the aid was insufficient to save the plant, which closed for good in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The Mitsubishi closure is seen as the beginning of the end for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008 prompted further [[government_policies_and_the_automotive_industry | government policies and the automotive industry]] interventions, including the Green Car Innovation Fund and the Automotive Transformation Scheme, subsidizing investment and research, particularly in energy efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. The government also provided GM-Holden a $200 million AUD line of credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

A new government coalition, led by Prime Minister Tony Abbott, took power in 2013 and opposed government interventions to "prop up private business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. At this point, the Australian automobile manufacturing industry was a shadow of its former self, with production numbers far below the 250,000 cars per factory per year typical of modern manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. Australian labor was also significantly more expensive than in emerging low-cost manufacturing hubs like China and Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

Despite efforts by Australian labor unions to compromise, the industry ultimately needed government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. The new government's perceived instability and uncertainty regarding future policy, compounded by Finance Minister Joe Hockey's blunt dismissal of GM's overtures, led Toyota and GM to finally pull out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. The last factory operated by Toyota closed in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Consequences and Future Prospects

The demise of Australia's domestic auto industry had wide-ranging consequences:

*   **Components Industry**: 260 Australian businesses supplied the automotive sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. Without the domestic assembly industry, many component manufacturers lacked economies of scale and closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. For example, 70% of the Toyota Camry's parts were once made in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.
*   **Research and Development (R&D)**: R&D spending by Australian automotive companies, which had been $700 million AUD in its final years (2% of the country's total R&D spending), vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
*   **Laid-off Workers**: Approximately 14,000 people lost their jobs when the Toyota and GM-Holden factories closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. While many could rely on redundancy payments and other assets, programs designed to help retrenched workers were often misaligned with their skills and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.
*   **Cultural Impact**: The industry's demise closed a uniquely Australian chapter of history. Australian cars, despite foreign ownership, were seen as thoroughly Australian, embodying a pioneering spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

While there are no simple "heroes or villains" in this historical outcome, the government's role is debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Unlike Canada, which has a far more productive auto industry due to its proximity to the US, Australia faced challenges of remote location and higher costs of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>. Some argue that more decisive government intervention, perhaps akin to Japan's MITI arranging mergers to create national champions, could have preserved the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

Despite the manufacturing decline, Australia still has [[future_prospects_for_australian_automotive_technology | future prospects for Australian automotive technology]]. Toyota and other automakers continue to leverage Australia's educated labor to develop new automotive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. For example, the former Toyota Altona factory is being converted into a transport hub for green hydrogen technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

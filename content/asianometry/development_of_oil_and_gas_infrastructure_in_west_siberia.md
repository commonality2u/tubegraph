From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

In 1979, the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet Union]] was the world's leading oil producer, pumping 11.5 million barrels daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The country finished the 1960s as the second-largest oil-producing nation, but its most abundant oil and natural gas reserves, hidden beneath Siberia's frozen swamps and lakes, were yet to be fully exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This development significantly contributed to the [[Rise of the Soviet Union as an energy superpower | Soviet Union's rise as an energy superpower]] and ultimately, its dissolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## West Siberian Basin: A Frontier for Energy Development

The West Siberian Basin, located approximately 600 miles east of the Ural Mountains, is a vast, flat area covering 3.4 million square kilometers, or nearly five times the size of Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. About a third of this region, almost one million square kilometers, is potentially oil-bearing, an area larger than Texas and Oklahoma combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Harsh Conditions and Sparse Population
The region is characterized by undeveloped, harsh, and remote conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>:
*   Short summers and long, severe winters with temperatures dropping to -27 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Common frost and fog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Sixty to seventy percent of the area consists of swamps and lakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   Lakes freeze to their bottoms for 9 or 10 months of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   It is sparsely populated, with most earlier settlers having moved to the Siberian south due to the cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Immense Reserves
Despite the challenging environment, the lands beneath West Siberia contain some of the world's largest oil and gas deposits, second only to those in the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. These deposits date back to the Triassic and Jurassic periods and include the massive Urengoy gas field and Russia's largest oil field, Samotlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Samotlor partially overlies the Siberian Traps, a site of one of Earth's largest known eruption events 250 million years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Shifting Policy Towards Siberian Development

From 1960 to 1970, the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet Union's]] total oil production surged from under 3 million barrels per day to 7.1 million barrels, with much of this new oil coming from the "Second Baku" area of the Volga-Ural province in European Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Although Soviet geologists had predicted significant deposits in the West Siberian Basin as early as the 1930s, the government initially refrained from developing these fields, questioning their scale and extraction feasibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. A high-ranking communist party member dismissed claims of West Siberian reserves as "fruit of a sick provincial imagination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Circumstances changed when the Volga-Ural oil fields began to decline much faster than anticipated in the mid-to-late 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This decline posed a severe threat to the [[Postwar Soviet oil expansion and political influence | Soviet oil industry's critical functions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>:
1.  **Foreign Currency Earning**: Over 50% of the country's foreign currency, vital for purchasing wheat and other goods, came from oil sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
2.  **Eastern Bloc Obligations**: The Soviets had long-term oil export obligations to the Eastern Bloc countries, all of whom, except Romania, depended on Soviet energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. These deliveries were made via extensive cross-country pipelines like "Druzbha" (Friendship) and "Bratsville" (Brotherhood) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Mobilizing for West Siberian Development

In January 1968, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin visited the Tyumen region of West Siberia, highlighting its economic potential and the urgent need for infrastructure development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. By 1971, Brezhnev personally pushed for the development of West Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. A new ministry was established to build oil infrastructure, led by Boris Shcherbina, a high-ranking Ukrainian Communist Party member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Shcherbina, later known for managing the Chernobyl crisis, was instrumental in founding the West Siberian oil and gas industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Overcoming Challenges and Attracting Labor
Developing West Siberia required creating entire towns from nothing, as the area was nearly uninhabited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Hundreds of thousands of geologists, builders, and work crews were needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Building worker settlements was difficult due to the harsh conditions, and all food had to be transported by rail as agriculture was nearly impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The cost of living was 1.5 to 1.7 times higher than in European parts of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

To attract workers, the Soviets offered significantly higher salaries (2.2 to 2.5 times greater than elsewhere) and easier promotion opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Media campaigns targeted specialists in older oil and gas regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Most workers were young, under 35, seeking to earn substantial money for a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Production Boom and Infrastructure Expansion

West Siberia soon began to yield its vast riches:
*   **1965**: 5.6 million tons of oil and 1.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **1970**: Oil production reached 31 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **1975**: Oil production surged to 141 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **1977**: Production hit an "insane" 211 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
By 1973, 113 oil fields had been discovered, including supergiant fields like Samotlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

### Pipeline Construction
The Soviets built extensive gas pipelines to transport products to buyers in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. In the second half of the 1970s, 1,400 kilometers of pipeline were laid, moving 130 million cubic meters of soil and tearing up 27.2 million square meters of agricultural land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Construction rates were three to five times faster than in the West, resulting in costs per kilometer that were a third of Western averages, partly due to the disregard for environmental impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This included wastewater pollution, torn-up taiga, and hundreds of abandoned drilled wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The economic plan took precedence over ecological concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## International Energy Trade and Political Influence

West Siberia's oil dominance found timely customers. International conflicts in the 1950s and 1960s convinced Europe not to rely solely on Arab oil, making Soviet oil a compelling diversification option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **1968**: Austria was the first Western European country to strike an oil deal with the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **1969**: Italy followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **1970**: West Germany, despite domestic political issues like Berlin's division, agreed to take Soviet gas, with the ministry of economics believing a Soviet share under 20% would be acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This agreement contributed to the Four Power Agreement of 1971, where West and East Germany de facto recognized each other's sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **1972**: France followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

During the 1970s, as part of "detente," the [[Soviet energy trade relationships with Eastern Bloc and Western Europe | Soviet Union]] sought economic partnerships with Western countries, including the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. In 1972, the U.S. and Soviet Union agreed on the potential "North Star" energy deal, which would have involved shipping liquefied Soviet natural gas (LNG) to the American West Coast from 1980 to 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This deal, which would have included Japan, promised vast LNG revenues and Western technologies for the Soviets, but it was ultimately denied by Congress in 1974 due to issues over most favored nation status and credit guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

The oil crises of the 1970s, including the Iranian Revolution, further accelerated economic exchanges between the Soviets and Western Europe, and many of these energy relationships persist today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Challenges to Soviet Energy Dominance and Decline

Despite its successes, the [[Rise of the Soviet Union as an energy superpower | Soviet oil juggernaut]] began showing signs of sputtering.
*   **Production Stagnation**: West Siberia's oil production growth rates rapidly declined, from 23.8% in 1976 to 7% in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Overall Slowdown**: The average annual growth rate for Soviet oil production fell from 9.1% in the 1960s to 6.2% between 1971 and 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. By 1981, the country's total oil growth rate was under one percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Without access to more advanced Western drilling technology, the Soviets resorted to doubling exploratory drilling each year, increasing from 13 million meters drilled in 1977 to over 26 million in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Sixteen million of this new drilling occurred in West Siberia, forcing teams to travel further, drill deeper, and work in more complicated formations, which doubled drilling costs per meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Despite these efforts, Soviet oil output fell into negative growth by 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This meant the [[Economic and environmental impacts of Soviet oil production | Soviet energy industry]] and economy were investing more to produce less, entering a seemingly inescapable cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

The [[Postwar Soviet oil expansion and political influence | Soviet economy]] had become more energy-intensive, requiring 0.83 tons of coal equivalent to generate $1,000 of economic income by 1987, up from 0.71 tons in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Unlike Western economies, where car drivers and households accounted for significant oil consumption (allowing for more flexibility), nearly half of Soviet oil consumption came from heavy industry, which was less flexible in adjusting usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Coupled with considerable oil export obligations, the Soviets had little room to cut consumption, necessitating continued production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

## The Final Blow: Oil Price Collapse and Dissolution

By the late 1980s, the [[Soviet Union early oil industry development | Soviet Union]] remained the world's largest producer of oil and third-largest producer of coal, yet its economy stagnated, consumed by its unproductive energy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Coherence within the Eastern Bloc faded as the Soviets prioritized their own needs, leading satellite states to turn to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

Then, in 1986, oil prices collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Increased output from Alaska, the British North Sea, and OPEC (particularly Saudi Arabia drastically raising quotas in September 1985) contributed to an oil glut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Oil prices plummeted from $27 a barrel to below $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. All the investment the Soviets had poured into oil suddenly turned to a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Foreign currency earnings from oil and gas sales evaporated, paving the way for the debt crisis that led to the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union linked to oil and gas industry challenges | dissolution of the Soviet Union]] a few years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

The high energy revenues from West Siberia, while seemingly beneficial, papered over the need for much-needed economic reforms within the Soviet system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. For example, oil money allowed for the purchase of foreign food and computers, negating the need to improve domestic agriculture or technology production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. Energy, therefore, acted as both a pillar that sustained the Soviet house for longer than it should have and a crutch that weakened the country's ability to stand independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. The legacy of the Soviet energy superpower and its influence on European and Asian politics continues to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

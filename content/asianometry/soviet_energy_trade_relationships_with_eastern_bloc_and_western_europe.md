In 1979, the Soviet Union emerged as the world's leading oil producer, pumping 11.5 million barrels each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This marked a significant shift from the end of the 1960s when it was the second-largest oil-producing nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The country's most abundant oil and natural gas reserves, hidden beneath Siberia's frozen swamps and lakes, were yet to be fully exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The development of these resources was pivotal to the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union becoming an energy superpower]], and paradoxically, contributed to the country's [[collapse_of_the_soviet_union_linked_to_oil_and_gas_industry_challenges | eventual dissolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Development of West Siberian Oil Fields

The Soviet West Siberian Basin, located approximately 600 miles east of the Ural Mountains, is a vast area of 3.4 million square kilometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. About a third of this area, nearly one million square kilometers, is potentially oil-bearing, exceeding the combined size of Texas and Oklahoma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This region is undeveloped, harsh, and remote, characterized by short summers, long severe winters, and temperatures plunging to as low as -27 degrees Celsius, leading to common frost and fog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Sixty to seventy percent of the area consists of swamps and lakes, which freeze solid for 9 or 10 months of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Despite its sparse population and challenging conditions, the area holds some of the world's largest oil and gas deposits, second only to those in the Persian Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. These include the massive Urengoy gas field and Russia's biggest oil field, Samotlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

From 1960 to 1970, the Soviet Union's total oil production surged from under 3 million barrels per day to 7.1 million barrels, much of which came from the Second Baku area of the Volga-Ural province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Although geologists had predicted significant deposits in West Siberia since the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, the Soviet government initially hesitated to develop these fields due to uncertainties about the scale and extraction challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. One high-ranking Communist Party member famously stated:
> "The huge oil and gas reserves that the people of West Siberia talk about so much are nothing more than the fruit of a sick provincial imagination. They must stop misleading everyone and go about their business." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>

### Changing Circumstances and Strategic Importance
Circumstances compelled a change in Soviet policy. In the mid-to-late 1960s, the Volga-Ural oil fields began to decline much faster than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Between 1971 and 1975, the decline in European oil fields was 261 million tons, far exceeding the planned 150 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Oil production was critical for the Soviets for two primary reasons:
1.  **Foreign Currency**: The oil industry was the country's largest source of foreign currency, accounting for over 50% of earnings used to purchase wheat and other goods from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
2.  **Eastern Bloc Obligations**: The Soviets had [[postwar_soviet_oil_expansion_and_political_influence | long-term oil export obligations]] to the countries of the Eastern Bloc, all of which (except Romania) depended on Soviet energy supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. These deliveries were made via extensive pipelines named "Druzba" (Friendship) or "Bratsville" (Brotherhood) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

In January 1968, Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin visited the Tyumen region of West Siberia, recognizing its potential for the Soviet economy and the need for infrastructure development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. By 1971, Brezhnev began urgently pushing for West Siberian development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. A new ministry was established to build oil infrastructure, led by Boris Shcherbina, who would later manage the Chernobyl crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Shcherbina is also credited as the founder of the West Siberian oil and gas industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Developing West Siberia required creating entire towns from nothing, as the area was sparsely populated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Hundreds of thousands of geologists, builders, and work crews were needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. To attract workers to this harsh environment, salaries were made 2.2 to 2.5 times higher than elsewhere, and promotion was easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The majority of these workers were young (under 35), seeking to earn significant money quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Rapid Production Growth and Environmental Costs
West Siberia quickly began to yield its vast riches:
*   **1965**: 5.6 million tons of oil, 1.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **1970**: Oil production reached 31 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **1975**: Oil production reached 141 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   **1977**: Oil production reached an "insane" 211 million tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

By 1973, 113 oil fields had been discovered, including supergiant fields like Samotlor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The Soviets built long gas pipelines to transport products to Europe, laying down 1,400 kilometers of pipeline in the second half of the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Pipeline construction rates were three to five times faster than in the West, resulting in one-third of Western costs per kilometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This speed came at a significant environmental cost, with complete disregard for ecology, leading to wastewater pollution, torn-up taiga, and hundreds of abandoned wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The economic plan had to be fulfilled "no matter what" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Energy Trade with Western Europe

The rise of West Siberian oil coincided with international conflicts in the 1950s and 60s, which demonstrated to Europe the risks of sole reliance on Arab oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Soviet oil became a compelling diversification option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Key Western European countries that struck energy deals with the Soviets:
*   **Austria**: 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>
*   **Italy**: 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>
*   **West Germany**: 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>
*   **France**: 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>

West Germany was a particularly notable partner, as its decision to accept Soviet gas was domestically controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. While domestic gas demand was skyrocketing, political issues such as Berlin's division and German reunification posed challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. The German Ministry of Economics believed that if the Soviet share remained under 20%, it would be acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. A year after West Germany began accepting Soviet gas, the Four Power Agreement of 1971 was signed, leading to de facto recognition between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

These agreements spurred further economic partnerships throughout the 1970s as part of DÃ©tente <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, even extending to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. In 1972, the U.S. and Soviet Union agreed on a potential "North Star" energy deal, where Soviet natural gas would be liquefied and shipped to the American West Coast from 1980 to 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. The Soviets and energy lobbyists strongly desired this deal, as it would have brought significant LNG revenues and Western technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. However, Congress ultimately rejected it, denying the Soviets most-favored-nation status and credit guarantees, leading to the deal's cancellation in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

The oil crises of the 1970s, including the Iranian Revolution, further accelerated economic exchanges between the Soviets and Western Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Despite the Soviet's reputation as an erratic trade partner, many of these energy relationships persist to this day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Energy Trade with the Eastern Bloc (CMEA)

Soviet oil and energy exports were a crucial component holding the Eastern Bloc together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. After World War II, the Soviet Union established the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) for Eastern Bloc states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Within the CMEA, trade was largely confined to member states: the Soviets supplied raw goods to its satellites, which in turn sent back manufactured goods, machinery, and agricultural produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

These oil deliveries were made on "brotherly terms," at prices significantly lower than Western market prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The Soviet Union could not pass on increased extraction costs to its allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Since the mid-1960s, these inter-bloc trade agreements were known to be unfavorable to the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. As the lucrative West European energy export industry developed in the 1970s, the opportunity costs of these "friendship oil trade agreements" became increasingly clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

Despite the financial burden, the satellite states, particularly East Germany, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary, had become highly dependent on these "brotherly" oil imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Failing to meet these oil obligations would have severe political and socio-economic repercussions, especially as the satellites increasingly became indebted to Western creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

## Decline of Soviet Oil and its Consequences

Contrary to expectations of infinite growth, West Siberia's oil production growth rates rapidly declined, from 23.8% in 1976 to 7% in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This abrupt stagnation had massive ripple effects across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. The overall Soviet oil growth rate, which averaged 9.1% annually in the 1960s, fell to 6.2% between 1971 and 1978, sputtering to under 1% by 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

Without access to more advanced oil drills and pumps from the West, the Soviets, under Brezhnev, resorted to doubling exploratory drilling, from 13 million meters drilled in 1977 to over 26 million in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Sixteen million of this new drilling occurred in West Siberia, requiring teams to travel further, drill deeper, and work in more complex formations, doubling drill costs per meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Despite these efforts, Soviet oil output fell into negative growth by 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. The Soviet energy industry and economy found itself investing more to produce less, caught in an inescapable cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

By the late 1980s, despite being the world's largest oil producer and third-largest coal producer, the Soviet economy stagnated, consumed by its unproductive energy industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Cohesion within the Eastern Bloc faded as the Soviets prioritized their own needs over those of their socialist allies, leading satellite states to turn to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

### The 1986 Oil Price Collapse
In 1986, oil prices collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Increased output from Alaska, the British North Sea, and OPEC (particularly Saudi Arabia drastically raising quotas in September 1985) contributed to an oil glut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Oil prices plummeted from $27 a barrel to below $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. This rendered the significant Soviet investments in oil unprofitable, causing foreign currency earnings from oil and gas sales to evaporate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. This paved the way for the debt crisis that contributed to the dissolution of the Soviet Union a few years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

Ultimately, high energy revenues may have inadvertently hindered the Soviet Union by masking the need for vital economic reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>. There was less incentive to improve domestic agriculture or produce computers if oil money could fund imports from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. While energy was a pillar that sustained the Soviet house longer than it might have otherwise, it also acted as a "crutch that weakened the country's ability to stand up on its own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. The legacy of the Soviet energy superpower continues to influence European and Asian politics today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

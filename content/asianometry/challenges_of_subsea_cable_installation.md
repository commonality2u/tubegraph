Laying subsea cables presents numerous challenges, particularly for long-distance intercontinental projects like the proposed Sun Cable. Engineers must consider various factors, from the seabed topography to potential interference and the inherent difficulties in manufacturing and financing the cables themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## General Principles for Laying Subsea Cables

When installing subsea cables, two key principles are followed:
*   **Minimize Length** The overall length of the cable should be kept as short as possible to reduce manufacturing and maintenance costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Avoid Difficult Terrain** Laying cables requires avoiding large, deep trenches and steep slopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Historically, most subsea power cables have been installed in relatively shallow depths (under 0.6 miles or 1 kilometer) on flat seabeds composed of silt, sand, or pebbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Specific Challenges for Long-Distance Projects

Projects spanning vast distances face unique obstacles that deviate from traditional subsea cable laying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Deep Water and Complex Topography
Unlike typical installations, long-distance routes often traverse areas with steep slopes and deep waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. For instance, a proposed route for the Sun Cable project would cross a 700-mile (1,200-kilometer) section of the Timor trough, where depths exceed a mile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This presents a major challenge, although it has been achieved before, such as with the SA.PE.I cable between Sardinia and the Italian mainland, which reaches similar depths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

Specialized cables, like those made of aluminum instead of copper, may be required for deepwater sections. While aluminum is less conductive, it is cheaper and lighter, allowing Cable Laying Vessels to carry and deploy more cable, reducing the expensive and time-consuming operations of deepwater ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Interference in Busy Waterways
In shallower sections of a route, interference becomes a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Waterways like the Java Sea and Singapore Strait are among the busiest globally, crisscrossed by pipelines, frequented by fishing trawlers, and traversed by thousands of ships annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

To protect the cable from damage by fishing nets, boat anchors, or other dropped objects, engineers must often trench or bury the cable 2-5 feet (0.6-1.5 meters) deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Such damage can lead to blackouts and trigger liability clauses in service agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### HVDC Cable Manufacturing Limitations
A substantial challenge lies not in laying the cable, but in acquiring it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The manufacturing sector for [[modern_advancements_in_undersea_cable_technology | High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC)]] cables is highly specialized, producing complex products at a slow rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. For example, the Sun Cable project alone requires two cables of 3,200 kilometers each, which exceeds the total annual output of all HVDC cable manufacturers in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This necessitates setting aside additional time (3-5 years) and capital to expand manufacturing capacity globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Immense Costs and Financing
The financial outlay for subsea cable projects is enormous. The subsea cable portion of the Sun Cable project is estimated to cost approximately $5.6 billion USD before insurance and administrative expenses, with $4.6 billion specifically for the cable itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This cost significantly surpasses existing projects; for instance, the Basslink cable in Australia, though much shorter, cost $670 million USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. When combined with other project components like the solar farm, the total cost can exceed $10 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

Securing funding often requires multi-decade service agreements between the cable company and the power purchasing entity, attracting private investors with the promise of regular dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Operational and Maintenance Issues
Even after installation, challenges persist. For example, the Basslink cable suffered a brutal outage less than ten years after its 2006 commissioning, taking six months to repair amid difficult sea conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Such incidents can lead to significant financial penalties and even technical defaults for the operating company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. These experiences highlight the importance of learning from past incidents and robust [[protection_and_security_measures_for_undersea_cables | protection and security measures for undersea cables]] to avoid future mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. The feasibility of such large-scale infrastructure via public-private partnerships can also be called into question given these complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

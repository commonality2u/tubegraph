In 1995, over 30 companies competed to build the best graphics chips for personal computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Six years later, only three remained, with Nvidia clearly in the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. As of the transcript's writing, Nvidia is the 15th biggest company globally, valued at half a trillion dollars, and their graphics cards quickly sell out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The company was also seeking to acquire ARM for $40 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This article explores how Nvidia rose to dominate the graphics card industry and become a leading tech juggernaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Founding and Early Vision

Nvidia was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Jensen Huang served as the company's President and CEO, while Malachowsky and Priem focused on the technical aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The company's goal was to create microprocessors capable of rendering high-quality [[the_impact_3d_gaming_on_graphics_technology | 3D graphics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Their name, Nvidia, comes from the Latin word meaning "envy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## [[history_of_early_graphics_card_competition | Early Graphics Card Competition]]

The idea of separate hardware for complicated 3D graphics processing existed before Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Atari video game consoles in the 1970s had graphics chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Commercial video cards, plugged into the main computer, emerged in the 1980s, such as the IBM Professional Graphics Controller (PGA) released in 1984, which used an Intel 8088 microprocessor to free up the CPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Despite its high cost ($4,000-$5,000) and limited compatibility, the concept of a video card gained traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

In the late 1980s, Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) became a dominant graphics player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. SGI refined the concept of a graphics pipeline, which translates coordinates to 2D pixel space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. In 1992, SGI released OpenGL, a public 3D graphic standard (API) with 120 commands, which became widely adopted and a critical factor for graphics hardware support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. While SGI hardware dominated the profitable graphics workstation market, it did not seriously target the consumer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### The Impact of 3D Gaming

Consumer interest in graphics significantly increased with the release of Microsoft Windows 3.1 in 1990, which featured a graphical user interface (GUI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. However, it was the 1993 release of the 3D game *Doom* by id Software that truly propelled demand for graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This was followed by *Quake* in 1996, which offered full real-time 3D rendering and online multiplayer, proving to be another massive hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

*Quake*'s advanced graphics often strained PC capabilities, leading to poor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Main programmer John Carmack initially worked with chip designer Rendition, but later rewrote the game to support OpenGL, creating "GLQuake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This spurred new innovation in the consumer video card space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## 3dfx's Dominance

A graphics chip startup called 3dfx quickly developed a wrapper program to make OpenGL compatible with their proprietary Glide graphics API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Leveraging a drop in RAM prices, they launched the Voodoo video card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Voodoo cards, with chips designed by 3dfx and manufactured in Taiwan, were sold to board partners for resale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. It was the first consumer video card capable of running GLQuake effectively at 640x480 resolution and 16-bit color at 30 frames per second, retailing for around $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

Crucially, the Voodoo only offered 3D acceleration, requiring users to have a separate card for 2D acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Despite this limitation, it sold very well, and at its peak, 3dfx held 80% of the 3D acceleration graphics card market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Nvidia's Early Struggles and Strategic Pivots

While 3dfx dominated, Nvidia was struggling in the mid-1990s Silicon Valley downturn, being just one of many graphics chip startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. They eventually secured $2.5 million in funding from two VC firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. With this capital, Jensen Huang struck three crucial [[Nvidias strategic partnerships and product development | partnerships]] to provide the company with early momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>:

1.  **Manufacturing Partnership with SGS-Thomson Microelectronics**: In 1994, Nvidia, unable to afford its own manufacturing facilities, partnered with SGS-Thomson (now STMicroelectronics). Nvidia handled design, while SGS-Thomson managed manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
2.  **Sales Partnership with Diamond Multimedia Systems**: Diamond agreed to buy Nvidia's chips and integrate them into their multimedia accelerator boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
3.  **Brand Partnership with Sega**: Sega, a popular video game company seeking to port its arcade and console games to PCs, selected Nvidia for assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Sega allowed Nvidia to use their brand name for the launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

These partnerships led to Nvidia's first product, the NV1, launched in May 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The NV1 was a multimedia PCI card offering graphics, sound, and Sega gamepad support, aiming to converge multiple multimedia functions into one "sound blaster of multimedia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Although technically impressive, the NV1 tried to do too much, resulting in compromises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. More critically, it was not compatible with leading graphics APIs like OpenGL or 3dfx's Glide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Consequently, the NV1 was a flop, and Nvidia stopped selling it in late 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. A planned advanced NV2 with Sega also fell through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

After the NV1's failure, Nvidia pivoted its strategy, securing an additional $6.5 million in funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. The company made three key bets for its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>:

1.  **Betting on Microsoft Direct3D**: Microsoft quickly recognized the growing trend of 3D PC games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. In 1996, Microsoft acquired RenderMorphics and created Direct3D, a 3D graphics API that was part of the larger DirectX bundle and built into Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Microsoft promoted Direct3D as the best way for game development, claiming OpenGL was "inherently slow," despite criticism from figures like John Carmack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Nvidia bet its future on Direct3D's integration with Windows making it the dominant API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

2.  **Vertical Integration and In-House Drivers**: Previously, device drivers (software controlling hardware) were often written by board partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Nvidia chose to take driver development in-house, aligning incentives and allowing them to dedicate significant time to ensure quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. This approach allowed Nvidia to aggregate issues and experiences from all its board partners, leading to very high-performing device drivers, which became a cornerstone of their future success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

3.  **Betting on Moore's Law and Outsourced Manufacturing**: Nvidia decided to lean on ever-improving manufacturing processes and outsourced manufacturing for speed and rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. In 1998, they ended their partnership with SGS-Thomson and partnered with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Jensen Huang admired TSMC founder Morris Chang's philosophy of never competing with partners and focusing on their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. This partnership allowed Nvidia to focus entirely on design rather than manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Nvidia became one of TSMC's biggest customers, and TSMC eventually surpassed Intel as the best chip manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

## The Riva 128 and Relentless Product Cycle

With its new strategy, Nvidia launched its second product, the Riva 128, in 1997, with less than six weeks of cash remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. The Riva 128 was specifically designed to accelerate Direct3D, with OpenGL support via a wrapper program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Critically, it supported both 3D and 2D graphics, a functionality that 3dfx Voodoo lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. The Riva 128 sold well, with Diamond Multimedia reselling it as the Diamond Viper 330 for about $140 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

Nvidia optimized for speed and rapid iteration, organizing its teams into three groups: one for the upcoming design, one for a refresh of the previous year's design, and one for the next year's design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. They adopted advanced chip design processes, including computer-aided design, verification, and validation, with extensive simulations to prevent costly bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. This resulted in a relentless six-month product cycle, delivering a new chip generation every half-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This brutal pace caused many graphics card companies to drop out, with only ATI (later acquired by AMD in 2006 for $5.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>) managing to keep up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

## Competitor Missteps and Market Consolidation

### 3dfx's Downfall
Going into 1998, 3dfx held the market lead with Voodoo Graphics, but its 3D-only limitation allowed Nvidia and ATI to gain a foothold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. 3dfx struggled to produce a proper 3D/2D follow-up, with their Rush chipset (mid-1997) performing poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. It took over a year for them to release a competitive product, the Banshee, in September 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. Their 3D-only Voodoo 2 was released 17 months after the original Voodoo, yet it still sold well, maintaining a third of the high-end market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

However, 3dfx made a critical misstep: they acquired boardmaker STB for $141 million in December 1998 and announced that their chips would only be available in their own name-branded boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. This meant 3dfx was directly competing with its former customers, causing old partners to defect to Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. 3dfx management had no manufacturing experience, and STB's Mexico-based facilities could not compete with Asian competitors, turning the division into a cash burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. 3dfx eventually dissolved, selling its assets to Nvidia in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

### Intel's Foray
In 1996, Intel predicted that 80% of PCs would have 3D graphics by the millennium's end and that they would dominate the space by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Intel's influence was so significant that it caused Microsoft to cancel its own line of graphics hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. As promised, Intel released the Intel 740 card in 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. However, the card did not sell well due to its reliance on the new AGP port format (while the market stuck with PCI) and lagging real-world performance despite good speed tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. Intel, accustomed to longer CPU development cycles, could not keep up with the rapid pace of the graphics market, and the i740 was quickly discontinued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

Intel continued to tinker in the integrated graphics processor (IGP) space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. By leveraging its CPU monopoly, Intel built massive market share in IGPs, which use a portion of system memory rather than dedicated memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. While not top-of-the-line, Intel's entry wiped out the market for low-margin, low-performance graphics needs, leaving the rest of the industry caught in the middle, causing many companies to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

By the early 2000s, the graphics card market had consolidated from over 30 companies to just three: Nvidia and ATI (a clear duopoly) and Intel, which dominated the low end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Vertical Integration Lessons
> Nvidia's decision to expand vertically into device driver development provided a lasting competitive edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. In contrast, 3dfx's vertical integration into manufacturing destroyed value, burned cash, and alienated key customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.

## Beyond Graphics Cards

Nvidia has since looked beyond solely being a graphics chipset provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. In 1999, they coined the phrase "general processing unit" or [[Nvidias innovation with general processing unit concept | GPU]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. They began popularizing the concept of general-purpose computing, envisioning new applications for their technology beyond video game graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. This vision would come to fruition in the years that followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

In 1995, over 30 companies competed to build the best graphics chips for personal computers, a number that consolidated to just three six years later, with Nvidia emerging as the clear leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. As of the time of writing, Nvidia is the 15th largest company globally, valued at half a trillion dollars, with its graphics cards consistently selling out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The company has sought to acquire Arm for $40 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Founding and Early Vision

Nvidia was founded in 1993 by Jensen Huang, Chris Malachowsky, and Curtis Priem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Huang served as the company's president and CEO, while Malachowsky and Priem focused on the technical side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Jensen Huang was born in Tainan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The company's initial goal was to create microprocessors capable of rendering high-quality 3D graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Their name, Nvidia, comes from the Latin word for "envy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Early Graphics Hardware Landscape

The concept of dedicated hardware for 3D graphics processing predates Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Atari video game consoles in the 1970s already had graphics chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Commercial video cards that plugged into main computers appeared in the 1980s, such as the IBM Professional Graphics Controller (PGA), which used an onboard Intel 8088 microprocessor to offload video tasks from the CPU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Released in 1984, the PGA was expensive ($4,000-$5,000) and proprietary to IBM PCs, leading to its market failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, but the concept persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

In the late 1980s, Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) became a dominant graphics player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. SGI refined the "graphics pipeline," a conceptual model for processing graphics data from coordinates to 2D pixel space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. In 1992, SGI released OpenGL, a public 3D graphics API that became widely adopted in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. While SGI hardware dominated the profitable graphics workstation market, it did not seriously target the consumer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## The Rise of Consumer Graphics

Consumer interest in graphics surged with Microsoft Windows 3.1 in 1990, which featured a graphical user interface (GUI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. However, it was the release of the 3D game *Doom* by id Software in 1993 that truly ignited consumer demand for graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. *Doom* offered a mature, action-packed first-person shooter experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Its successor, *Quake*, released in 1996, introduced full real-time 3D rendering and online multiplayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Many PCs struggled to run *Quake* at full specifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. John Carmack, *Quake*'s programmer, initially worked with Rendition on a customized version for their Verite chips, but after this fell through, he rewrote the game to support OpenGL, creating *GLQuake* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This spurred [[impact_of_technological_advancements_on_graphics_cards | innovation]] in the consumer video card space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### 3dfx's Dominance

3dfx, a graphics chip startup, capitalized on *GLQuake*'s popularity by creating a wrapper program to make OpenGL compatible with their proprietary Glide graphics API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. They then launched the Voodoo video card, exploiting a drop in RAM prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Voodoo cards, featuring chips designed by 3dfx in America and manufactured in Taiwan, were the first consumer video cards to run *GLQuake* effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. They sold for approximately $200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Crucially, the Voodoo only offered 3D acceleration, requiring a separate card for 2D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Despite this limitation, 3dfx achieved 80% of the 3D acceleration graphics card market at its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Nvidia's Early Challenges and Strategic Moves

While 3dfx dominated, Nvidia faced a downturn in Silicon Valley in the mid-1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. They secured $2.5 million in funding from two VC firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Jensen Huang then initiated three crucial [[key_partnerships_and_strategic_moves_of_nvidia | partnerships]]:

1.  **Manufacturing:** In 1994, Nvidia partnered with SGS-Thomson Microelectronics (now STMicroelectronics) for chip manufacturing, with Nvidia focusing on design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
2.  **Board Partners:** Nvidia partnered with Diamond Multimedia Systems, which agreed to buy Nvidia's chips for its multimedia accelerator boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
3.  **Sega:** Sega, a popular video game company, selected Nvidia to help port its arcade and console games to PCs, allowing Nvidia to use its brand name for the launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### The NV1 Flop

In May 1995, Nvidia launched its first product, the NV1, a multimedia PCI card integrating graphics, sound, and Sega gamepad support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The goal was to converge these functions into one card, similar to a "sound blaster of multimedia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Diamond Multimedia resold it as the Diamond Edge 3D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Although technically impressive, the NV1 tried to do too much, resulting in compromises and, crucially, was incompatible with leading graphics APIs like OpenGL and 3dfx's Glide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This led to its failure, and Nvidia ceased selling it in late 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Sega's plans for a more advanced NV1 (the NV2) for its next-generation console also fell through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Nvidia's Strategic Pivots

Following the NV1's failure, Nvidia pivoted, recognizing the growing trend of 3D PC games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. 3D graphics and visualization were seen as the "machine learning of its day," with widespread integration into applications beyond gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

Nvidia's leadership, inspired by Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee's "change everything" philosophy, made three key bets for its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>:

1.  **Microsoft Direct3D:** Microsoft had acquired RenderMorphics in 1996 and created its own 3D graphics API, Direct3D, as part of the DirectX bundle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Microsoft touted Direct3D to game developers as superior to OpenGL, sparking "nerd wars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. John Carmack famously criticized Direct3D as "horribly broken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Despite early criticism, Bill Gates himself advocated for Direct3D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Nvidia bet its future on Direct3D's eventual dominance due to its tight integration with Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
2.  **[[Impact of technological advancements on graphics cards | Vertical Integration]] of Device Drivers:** Instead of relying on board partners to write drivers, Nvidia opted to take control of its device drivers in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This aligned incentives, allowed Nvidia to dedicate sufficient time to quality, aggregate user experiences, and produce high-performing drivers, which became a cornerstone of its success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
3.  **Moore's Law and Outsourced Manufacturing (TSMC):** Nvidia bet on the power of ever-improving manufacturing processes and outsourced manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. In 1998, they ended their partnership with SGS-Thomson and formed a new one with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Jensen Huang appreciated TSMC's pure intentions, as their success was directly tied to their partners' success, and they pledged never to compete with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. This allowed Nvidia to focus entirely on design, optimizing for speed and rapid iteration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Nvidia became one of TSMC's biggest customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

### The Riva 128

With these strategic changes, Nvidia launched its second (or third) product, the Riva 128, in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Designed specifically to accelerate Direct3D, it also supported OpenGL through a wrapper program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Critically, it supported both 3D and 2D graphics, a functionality that 3dfx's Voodoo lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. The Riva 128 sold well, with Diamond Multimedia reselling it as the Diamond Viper 330 for about $140 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## [[Competition in the graphics card market of the 1990s | Market Consolidation and 3dfx's Decline]]

Nvidia's partnership with TSMC enabled a relentless six-month product cycle, delivering a new chip generation every half-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This brutal pace eliminated many graphics card companies, with only ATI able to keep up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

In 1998, 3dfx held the market lead with its Voodoo graphics set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. However, its 3D-only limitation allowed Nvidia and ATI to gain market share with their 2D/3D solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. 3dfx struggled to produce a proper 3D/2D follow-up, with their Rush chipset (mid-1997) performing poorly and the Banshee taking over a year to become competitive (September 1998) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. Their 3D-only Voodoo 2 was released 17 months after the original Voodoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

In December 1998, 3dfx made a critical misstep: it acquired boardmaker STB for $141 million and announced that its chips would only be available in its own branded boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. This alienated its former board partners, who defected to Nvidia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. 3dfx management lacked manufacturing experience, and STB's Mexico-based facilities could not compete with Asian competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>, becoming a cash drain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. 3dfx eventually dissolved, selling its assets to Nvidia in 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

### Intel's Failed Bid

Intel predicted that 80% of PCs would have 3D graphics by the end of the millennium and that it would dominate the space by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. This led Microsoft to cancel its own line of graphics hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. In 1998, Intel released the Intel 740 card, but it failed due to its reliance on the unpopular AGP port (while the market favored PCI) and lagging real-world performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. Intel, accustomed to a slower CPU development cycle, could not keep up with the rapid pace of the graphics market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

Intel discontinued the i740 but continued to develop integrated graphics processors (IGPs) that used system memory instead of dedicated pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. By leveraging its CPU monopoly, Intel gained massive market share in this low-end space, effectively wiping out the market for low-margin, low-performance graphics cards and forcing other companies out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>.

## The Modern Graphics Landscape

By the early 2000s, the graphics card market had consolidated from over 30 companies to just three: Nvidia and ATI forming a duopoly, with Intel dominating the low end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. Nvidia and ATI competed until AMD acquired ATI in 2006 for $5.6 billion, eventually replacing the ATI branding with its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. Today, AMD's graphics cards sell well and are used in game consoles, but the hierarchy is set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

Nvidia's success highlights the importance of [[key_partnerships_and_strategic_moves_of_nvidia | vertical integration]], particularly in areas that add lasting competitive value, such as device drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. In contrast, 3dfx's foray into manufacturing alienated customers and burned cash, ultimately destroying value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.

In 1999, Nvidia coined the term "general processing unit" (GPU), popularizing the concept of general-purpose computing beyond video game graphics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. This vision would later pave the way for [[evolution_of_ai_hardware_and_gpus | new applications]] and the [[the_ai_and_ai_chip_boom_landscape | AI and AI chip boom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.

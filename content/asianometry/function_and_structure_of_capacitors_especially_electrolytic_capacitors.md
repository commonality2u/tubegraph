Reports in the early 2000s detailed abnormal numbers of PC motherboards with leaking or popping capacitors, leading to computer failures and a distinct, fishy smell in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This widespread issue became known as the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Understanding the cause requires a look into the basic function and structure of capacitors, particularly electrolytic capacitors (E-caps).

## What is a Capacitor?

A capacitor is an electronic component that stores electricity, similar to a battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. However, unlike a battery, a capacitor discharges its electrical energy very rapidly, sometimes in mere microseconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

The basic structure of a capacitor consists of two electrically conductive plates, known as **electrodes** (the anode and cathode), separated by a material called the **dielectric** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The term "capacitor" is conceptually similar to its use in DRAM, subject to the same laws of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Electrolytic Capacitors (E-caps)

Electrolytic capacitors, often called E-caps, get their name from the **electrolyte**, which serves as the capacitorâ€™s cathode or negative electrode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This electrolyte can exist as a solid, gel, or liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Construction and Components

An E-cap is typically made from two strips of aluminium foil. Between these foils, there's a very thin separator layer of porous paper or tissue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The paper and the gap between the foil strips are saturated with the electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

The positive electrode (anode) foil is coated with a layer of aluminium oxide, which acts as the **dielectric** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The foils are connected to tabs for circuit board attachment, and the entire assembly is rolled up and sealed within a protective housing, usually made of aluminium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The seal prevents the electrolyte from drying out, and a vent may be present at the top to release built-up gas and prevent explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Characteristics and Advantages

While other types of capacitors exist, such as Tantalum E-caps, Aluminium E-caps are widely used due to their good capacitance (ability to hold charge) relative to their size and cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

A capacitor's ability to hold charge is directly correlated to the surface area of its electrodes and inversely correlated to the distance between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Aluminium E-caps leverage this by using thin separator paper, allowing the dielectric to be extremely thin and electrodes to be very close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Manufacturers further enhance performance by etching the aluminium foil to increase the electrodes' surface area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Uses of Capacitors

A typical PC motherboard might contain around 60 E-caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Their primary uses include:

*   **Filtering**: In power supply modules, capacitors smooth out fluctuating DC power from a rectifier into a steady output. They charge when voltage peaks and discharge when voltage dips to compensate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Decoupling**: Capacitors help smooth power supply fluctuations to sensitive chips like microprocessors. They absorb voltage spikes and boost voltage dips, acting like "drainage ponds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

E-caps are not limited to PC motherboards; they are also found in camcorders, VCRs, televisions, stereos, and LCD screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Industry and Market

The Aluminium E-cap industry is a multi-billion dollar sector, valued at about $3 to $3.5 billion in 2002 and $5 to $6 billion today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Suppliers are predominantly Japanese, Taiwanese, or Chinese, collectively producing billions of units annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. In 2002, Taiwan alone produced 22.5 billion E-caps, accounting for 30% of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Capacitor Aging and Failure

As electrochemical components, electrolytic capacitors naturally age and corrode, generally having shorter lifespans (about 10-20 years) than other capacitor types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. A key metric for capacitor health is **Equivalent Series Resistance (ESR)**; as a capacitor ages, its ESR rises, and capacitance slowly declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Factors like humidity and heat can accelerate this aging, with heat causing the electrolyte to dry up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Catastrophic failures, such as bulging or exploding capacitors, result in short circuits or even fires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. These catastrophic failures, which became common in the early 2000s, were the hallmark of the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### The Role of Electrolyte Formulation

A key factor in these failures, particularly during the [[capacitor_plague_in_the_early_2000s | Capacitor Plague]], was identified as issues with the electrolyte formulation. Investigations revealed that some bulging capacitors had electrolytes missing a critical additive called a "depolarizer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Depolarizers help reduce gas generation within the E-cap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

Without it, the electrolyte became too alkaline, dissolving the aluminium oxide dielectric layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. This thinning dielectric caused an unnatural increase in capacitance, a leading indicator of bulging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This exposed the underlying aluminium foil, leading to reactions with impurities that generated electrons. These electrons, in turn, reacted with hydrogen ions in the water-based electrolyte, producing hydrogen gas which caused the capacitors to rupture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

The complexity of the supply chain, including outsourcing to no-name suppliers and the prevalence of counterfeits, contributed to these failures. Counterfeit capacitors, for example, were found to lack sufficient ethylene glycol, which lowered the electrolyte's boiling point and made it unstable at higher temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

Despite past challenges, aluminium E-caps with water-based electrolytes are still in use today, offering the best capacitance for their size and price, with vendors largely having resolved the previous issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

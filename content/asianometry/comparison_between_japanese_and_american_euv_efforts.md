In 2019, ASML shipped the first high-volume EUV system, marking a shift in the semiconductor lithography industry from Asia towards Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This was a significant setback for Japan, as Japanese companies had led the lithography industry before ASML's emergence but were unable to commercialize EUV in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. [[Japans failed EUV development journey | Japan's failed EUV development journey]] illustrates the immense challenge of producing commercial-ready EUV systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Origins and Early Preferences

Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) was invented in Japan in 1986 by Dr. Hiro Kinoshita at NTT, who successfully printed a circuit pattern using EUV light and a reflective optic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. However, at the time, EUV was just one of several next-generation lithography candidates, including Electron Beam direct write, proximity X-ray, ion beam projection, Electron Beam projection, and 157 nanometer fluorine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The Japanese lithography industry explored all these options, but EUV was not their primary preference; they seemed to favor proximity X-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This assessment was shared by others, as the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) early EUV project was concluding without industry follow-up, and as late as 1997, Sematech ranked EUV fourth, with X-ray in first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## American Initiative: Intel and EUV LLC

The American semiconductor leader Intel, however, observed demonstrations in Japan and at DOE labs and was impressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. With the DOE EUV Project R&D team on the brink of disbandment, Intel provided bridge funding to maintain the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. A year later, in 1998, Intel and other American semiconductor manufacturers established EUV LLC, an industry-wide consortium dedicated to commercializing EUV lithography. This consortium aimed to provide an estimated $60 million per year for R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

EUV LLC operated for six years, from 1997 to 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. By its conclusion, the EUV LLC team had met all its objectives and produced a functional prototype known as the Engineering Test Stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Control of this project then transitioned to ASML, taking over from the American Silicon Valley Group Lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## Japan's Response: A Parallel Path

Intel's interest in EUV and the formation of EUV LLC took the Japanese by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Due to American restrictions on foreign participation, Japan's lithography manufacturers, Nikon and Canon, could not directly join EUV LLC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. However, they were permitted to engage in design reviews and working groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Consequently, Japan swiftly shifted strategy to pursue its own development path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. In 1998, a year after EUV LLC's inception, Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) initiated its own EUV lithography program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Organizational Structure and Collaboration

### American Approach

The American EUV lithography project benefited from a streamlined structure, with a single entity, EUV LLC, overseeing the early commercialization efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### Japanese Approach

The Japanese EUV effort rapidly expanded beyond the management capacity of a single research institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. By 2005, four distinct research consortia were involved, each focusing on specific parts of the EUV machine:
*   **ASET (Association of Super Advanced Electronic Technologies)**: A multi-year research consortium fully funded by MITI. ASET focused on basic technologies for the exposure tool, mask, and resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Specifically, it prioritized optics manufacturing (adding reflective multi-layers to mirrors and cleaning them) and metrology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. ASET also handled the EUV photoresist, collaborating with Himeji Institute of Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **EUVA (Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography System Development Association)**: Founded in 2001, EUVA took over the critical task of developing the exposure tool's light source, a decision made because ASET's resources were limited to optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. EUVA included academia and industry (five Japanese equipment companies and four semiconductor manufacturers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. They researched both laser-produced plasma (LPP) and discharge-produced plasma (DPP) approaches for generating EUV light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Leading Project**: Managed inter-university collaborations related to light sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Mirai**: Established by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, Mirai focused specifically on mask defect control and detection subsystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

This decentralized Japanese setup was complex compared to the American single-entity approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## Progress and Delays

Both American and Japanese programs shared information, allowing Japan to benefit from following the American lead, though the Americans were clearly ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### American Progress

*   Mid-2001: Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories, with Carl Zeiss, delivered the Micro Exposure Tool (MET), a small field prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   August 2006: ASML delivered two Alpha Demo Tools (full-field prototypes) to imec (Belgium) and State University of New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

### Japanese Progress and Challenges

Japan's EUV development plan in 2005 aimed for high-volume EUV lithography to reach the 45-nanometer process node by 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This required a complete EUV system by 2008 or 2009, including a working small-field device (pre-alpha) by late 2005, an Alpha tool by 2006, and a Beta tool by 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This was an optimistic schedule, necessary to catch up to ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

*   **Canon's Efforts**: In 2006, Canon and EUVA completed their small-field prototype, the SFET, installed at an R&D Center for testing. Canon aimed to start producing their full-field 6-mirror prototype, the VS2, in 2009 for completion by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. However, Canon struggled with core EUV issues like raising power levels, producing defect-free masks, and extending optic system lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. The global financial crisis further impacted Canon's profits, and while their camera plans recovered, the VS2 was never built, halting their lithography progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Nikon's Efforts**: Nikon was ahead of Canon, being the only immersion lithography producer besides ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. From 2001 to 2004, Nikon worked with ASET on three iterations of their small-field prototype, nicknamed HINA (High Numerical Aperture tool) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
    *   **EUV-1**: In April 2006, Nikon began producing their first full-field exposure tool, the 6-mirror EUV-1 Alpha device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. It was completed and installed at the Japanese semiconductor consortium SALIT, going live in January 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This progress was about 1.5 years behind ASML's 2006 Alpha demo tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.
    *   **Light Source Challenges**: The EUV-1 used a Discharge-Produced Plasma (DPP) contraption from Ushio and its subsidiary Extreme Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. While DPP was believed to be more power-efficient, smaller, and cleaner, it struggled to output sufficient power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. The EUV-1's light source topped out at 100 Watts, far below the high-volume production goal of 250 Watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. This would have required a major system change, swapping Xenon for Tin, but the Tin-based DPP still faced contamination and power issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. ASML also tried DPP but halted work in 2013, achieving sufficient power only with their laser double-shot method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
    *   **Contamination Issues**: The EUV-1 also struggled with carbon contamination on mirror surfaces from EUV light, which deteriorated reflectivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. While oxygen introduction and UV dry cleaning helped, a mysterious silicon carbon compound (cyloxane) contamination persisted into 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.
    *   **EUV-2 and EUV-3**: After EUV-1 testing, Nikon planned the EUV-2 for 2011-2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. However, ASML's lead grew to 18 months or even two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Amidst the 2009 financial crisis, Nikon cut R&D budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. The EUV-2 became an in-house unit, with Nikon targeting the EUV-3 for 2012, aiming for 16-11 nanometer process nodes by around 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. This was the last significant report on Nikon's EUV progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.

## End of Japan's Full EUV Ambition

In July 2012, Intel announced a $4 billion investment in ASML for up to a 15% stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. As Intel was Nikon's second-largest customer, this indicated that Intel was moving forward with ASML exclusively for EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. With hundreds of millions of dollars in annual R&D and capital expenditures for lithography, Nikon likely concluded that continuing EUV development without Intel as a cornerstone customer was no longer viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Nikon's EUV efforts quietly ceased; the EUV-3 never shipped in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. This left ASML as the sole remaining player in the EUV lithography industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

## Legacy and Cost

Despite not achieving a full EUV machine, Japan's EUV efforts were not entirely in vain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. Many component efforts led to viable technologically advanced businesses, such as the actinic blank inspection tool from Mirai in collaboration with Lasertec <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. Japanese companies also hold dominant positions in EUV photoresist, with JSR, Shin-Etsu, and Tokyo Ohka Kogyo as major suppliers, and Tokyo Electron manufacturing equipment to apply these resists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

The total cost of [[Japans failed EUV development journey | Japan's EUV effort]] from 1999 to 2012 is estimated to be between $5 billion and $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. This includes Nikon and Canon's R&D expenses, the $90 million annual budgets of ASET and the four consortia, and investments from other semiconductor makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. This is an exponential increase compared to the original VLSI project in the late 1970s, which cost about $150 million and led to Japan's semiconductor industry dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. Developing an independent EUV machine today would likely cost at least $5-10 billion, require direct guidance from European and American EUV makers, and take about 10 to 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

[[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | Intel]] and [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]] are the two primary companies producing and selling chips that utilize the x86 instruction set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In 2020, [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | Intel]]'s processor sales to China amounted to $20 billion, while [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]]'s reached $2.3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. These figures are comparable to or even higher than the revenue generated by these companies from the United States, highlighting China as a significant market for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This market importance has led to interest in how [[chinas_acquisition_and_development_of_x86_technology | Chinese companies]] are developing their own homegrown x86 processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Understanding x86 Architecture

x86 refers to a family of instruction set architectures (ISA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. A chip design company utilizes an instruction set, such as x86 or ARM, to create a CPU microarchitecture, which then forms the basis for a family of chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Different companies can share instruction sets but still produce distinct designs; for example, [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | Intel]] and [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]]'s x86 implementations differ in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Similarly, Apple's self-developed ARM chips perform differently from other chips using the ARM instruction set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

[[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | Intel]] initially developed and popularized x86, but licensed it to other companies for reasons related to second-sourcing and anti-competitive measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]] is the most well-known of these licensees, having a core license that led to extensive legal disputes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. In contrast, ARM the company licenses its intellectual property (IP) to other companies, which then produce and sell their own chips, often for smartphones and IoT devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Currently, most CPUs for PCs, game consoles, and servers are x86, known for handling compute-intensive tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. They power 481 of the world's top 500 supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## China's Drive for Domestic Alternatives

China's long-standing interest in [[developments_in_chinas_domestic_semiconductor_ecosystem | developing domestic alternatives to American technologies]] has recently intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Several factors contribute to this push:

*   **Edward Snowden Revelations**: The disclosures regarding American spying on foreign entities raised alarms globally, leading countries to scrutinize the implementation of American technologies in critical sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Increased US-China Competition**: Following the Sino-Soviet split, the period of US-China cooperation has largely passed, replaced by growing tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **National Champions**: China aims to foster homegrown national champions in vital industries like high-speed rail, solar, space, and now computer chips, as a matter of national pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Export Bans**: The Trump administration's actions to cut off companies like Huawei from access to American technologies fueled China's fears, emphasizing the need for domestic supply chains for its massive user base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## [[chinas_acquisition_and_development_of_x86_technology | Chinese Homegrown x86 Initiatives]]

China has two distinct lineages of homegrown x86 chips in its market: Zhaoxin and Hygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Zhaoxin

Zhaoxin represents the older lineage and possibly has better future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. They have been releasing CPUs since 2014, marketing them as domestically made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

*   **Joint Venture**: Zhaoxin is a fabless semiconductor joint venture between the Shanghai municipal government and Taiwan's Via Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **x86 License**: Via Technologies obtained its x86 architectural license through the 1999 acquisitions of Cyrix and Centaur Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Via's acquisition of Centaur led to a prolonged patent dispute with [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | Intel]], which was resolved with a 10-year cross-license agreement in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. A three-year grace period was granted in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Architecture and Performance**: Zhaoxin's architectures are direct descendants of Centaur Technologies' work, with their third-generation ZX-C architecture believed to be identical to Centaur's Isaiah 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Performance tests on their latest sixth-generation "Lujiazui" SoCs indicate they are approximately four to eight years behind the most recent American designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. They exhibit lower power usage than traditional desktop chips, reflecting their mobile and IoT origins, and are considered sufficient for China's low-end needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Foundry and Future**: Zhaoxin, being a fabless company, had its Lujiazui chips fabricated by [[us_technology_transfer_concerns_with_tsmc | TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. However, due to national security concerns, Zhaoxin has been trying to shift from [[us_technology_transfer_concerns_with_tsmc | TSMC]] to mainland alternatives like [[developments_in_chinas_domestic_semiconductor_ecosystem | SMIC]], potentially causing delays and performance loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Zhaoxin has also announced plans to enter the discrete GPU market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Hygon (Haiguang)

The second of China's x86 joint ventures was initiated by [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

*   **Joint Venture Formation**: In 2015, [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]] formed a joint venture to provide the [[chinas_acquisition_and_development_of_x86_technology | Chinese market]] with a version of its Zen 1 x86 chips, which could be designated as Chinese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. At the time, [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]] was in a difficult financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. The joint venture, collectively known as Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co-Limited (THATIC), included Chinese partners like the Chinese Academy of Sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Structure and Technology Transfer**: The joint venture had two layers: Haiguang Micro Electronics (HMC), 51% owned by [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]], and Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit Design Company (Hygon), where [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]] owned only 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. To control its IP while allowing the Chinese to claim the chips as homegrown, [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]] designed special x86 server chip IP that was handed to HMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. HMC, being majority-controlled by [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]], removed sensitive elements before passing the design to Hygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Hygon then made its own modifications, including designing the top-level architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The chip was returned to HMC ([[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]]) for approval and finishing, then sent to GlobalFoundries for fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, and finally given to Hygon for packaging and sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **US Government Scrutiny**: While [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]] briefed the Department of Defense, Commerce, and other US government bodies, and the Treasury Department ultimately agreed, the Department of Defense did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]] stated the chips would be for commercial purposes, but job postings and interviews in China suggested their use in new exascale supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. The complexity of this system, designed for Chinese public relations, also made detecting inadvertent technology transfers more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Current Status**: In 2019, THATIC was placed on an entity list, and [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]] agreed not to engage in further technology transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]] has since moved on to selling its fourth-generation Zen 3 chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Hygon still possesses the original IP from the joint venture, but it would be challenging to reverse engineer or port the technology to a non-US foundry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

## Outlook and Broader Context

While x86 maintains a strong position in the tech community, its dominance is not as absolute as it once was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. ARM is making inroads into areas traditionally dominated by x86, such as desktops and servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

[[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | In China]], x86 development is a niche within the broader [[developments_in_chinas_domestic_semiconductor_ecosystem | indigenous semiconductor efforts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Chips produced in this area are primarily for domestic consumption and cannot be exported due to potential litigation, nor are they highly competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. For China, ARM is currently the preferred architecture, with an estimated 95% of computer chips designed in China being ARM-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. If not ARM, the focus is on [[comparison_between_x86_arm_and_riscv_architectures | RISC-V]], an open-source instruction set backed by major players like Alibaba Cloud and HiSilicon 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

Despite the interesting developments in [[chinas_acquisition_and_development_of_x86_technology | Chinese x86 chips]], they still lag many years behind their American counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. These chips are unlikely to become a massive concern as long as [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | Intel]] and [[intel_and_amds_presence_in_the_chinese_market | AMD]] chips remain available in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. However, this availability is not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

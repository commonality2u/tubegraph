From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The semiconductor industry is currently facing a significant [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | shortage of trailing edge semiconductors]], which includes microcontrollers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. This scarcity impacts various sectors, from automation to industrial manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## Understanding Trailing Edge Semiconductors

Unlike "sexy leading-edge" chips produced with advanced technologies like extreme ultraviolet lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>, most chips are unheralded workhorses built with [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | trailing edge process nodes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

### Definition and Classification
*   TSMC defines a trailing node as anything at 16 nanometers or older <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>. These nodes accounted for approximately 50% of 2021 revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
*   They can be further subdivided into:
    *   **Mature nodes**: Generally considered in the 40 to 450 nanometer range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
    *   **Legacy nodes**: Anything older than 450 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   Most microcontrollers are manufactured using 110 or 180 nanometer processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:99">[02:01:99]</a>.

### Fab Characteristics
There are roughly 200 fabs operating globally, most of which were built before 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>. Initially, these factories produced leading-edge chips with high margins, but as the industry quickly evolved, chip prices for their products would collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. However, once built, a fab can remain operational as long as the market price is slightly higher than its variable costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:27">[02:46:27]</a>.

## Causes of the Shortage

The [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | shortage]] in trailing edge semiconductors has several contributing factors:

### Pre-Pandemic Tightness
Fab capacity at [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | trailing edge nodes]] had already been relatively tight for several years before early 2020 due to various industry factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:60">[02:59:60]</a>.

### [[impact_of_the_pandemic_on_semiconductor_supply_chains | Impact of the Pandemic]]
*   **Initial Downturn**: The first pandemic lockdowns in early 2020 caused economic activity to plummet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Automotive companies and other manufacturers halted production and cancelled orders, leading suppliers like STMicroelectronics to cut production (e.g., 50% at their advanced fabs in France) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   **Unexpected Bounce Back**: A massive, unexpected surge in economic activity during the summer of 2020 resulted in companies trying to get products out, leading to immediate shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:66">[03:37:66]</a>.
*   **Inventory Depletion and Over-ordering**: Companies first used existing inventories, then started buying more than needed to replenish depleted stocks and ensure future product output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:09">[03:50:09]</a>.

### Unprecedented Demand
The broader [[semiconductor_industrys_counterfeit_chip_problem | semiconductor industry]] is experiencing unprecedented demand for chips driven by cloud computing, the 5G wireless transition, and armed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:41">[04:02:41]</a>.

### Capacity Limits
Since 2019, fab utilization rates have soared from their long-term target of 80% to the mid-90s, indicating that foundries are at their operational limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:28">[04:13:28]</a>.

## [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | Challenges in Addressing the Shortage]]

Solving the [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | trailing edge chip shortage]] is complex due to several factors:

### Hesitancy to Invest
*   **Low Margins**: Customers are accustomed to low prices from foundries with fully depreciated fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Wafers for these nodes are very cheap, contributing only 10% of total sales revenues despite significant microprocessor volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
*   **Underutilization Risk**: Even with heightened demand, companies anticipate that investing hundreds of millions or billions in new fabs for these nodes would lead to substantial underutilization and financial underperformance in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. They prefer to manage existing backlogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

### Equipment Availability
Many trailing edge foundries rely on older, niche equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. For example, over 200 fabs use 200-millimeter wafers, an older standard compared to the current 300-millimeter industry standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. New 200-millimeter equipment is not readily available, forcing companies to buy refurbished items, which are now in short supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

### Slow Scaling Trends
Historically, major companies like AMD and Apple always moved to the fastest, leading-edge nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. However, this upscaling trend has slowed as it becomes harder and more costly to move to the next node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. Some chip types, such as analog mixed-signal, radio frequency chips, and MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems), do not scale well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. Demand for these chips is currently very high, especially due to events like the Ukrainian war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

### The 28-22 Nanometer Generation Gap
The 28 nanometer node is significant as it is likely the most advanced node still using a planar gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. Newer nodes require more complex finFET gates, rampant multi-patterning, and potentially EUV, leading to increased complexity, less reliable products, lower yields, and higher costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. Consequently, 28 nanometers represents the bottom of the cost curve on a per 100 million gate basis, as moving to newer nodes becomes more expensive per gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. Customers often prioritize reliability and effectiveness over raw speed, especially if it means dealing with these trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

### Automotive Industry Demand
Automotive companies are among the largest consumers of [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | trailing edge chips]], accounting for 40% of market demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. They require reliability across challenging conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

## Solutions and Outlook

The industry is beginning to recognize the need to address backlogs for older nodes, which are stretching to 18 months or longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

### Investment in New Fabs
*   **Industry Commitment**: Microchip Executive Chairman Steve Sanghi stated that $150 billion in additional investment is needed over the next five years to meet [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | trailing edge demand growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. However, only 6% of the hundreds of billions of dollars committed to new fabs is dedicated to mature or legacy node capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   **Key Players' Actions**:
    *   **TSMC**: Building two new [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | trailing edge fabs]] in Japan and Kaohsiung (28-22 nanometer nodes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. They recently increased prices on older nodes to help fund these fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.
    *   **Samsung**: Announced increased investment in [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | trailing edge semiconductor capacity]], a significant shift from their usual focus on leading-edge technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.
    *   **China**: Has up to a dozen new fabs under construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. SMIC, a leading Chinese foundry, is spending over $9 billion to add [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | trailing edge wafer capacity]] in Shanghai and Shenzhen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.
    *   **India**: The conglomerate Vedanta and Taiwan's Foxconn signed an MOU to build a [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | trailing edge fab]] (65 to 28 nanometer range) with substantial government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.
*   **Government Policies**: The U.S. CHIPS Act appropriated $2 billion specifically for "mature technology nodes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.

### Improving Existing Fabs
*   **Wafer Upgrades**: Moving from 200-millimeter to 300-millimeter wafers can yield over two times as many dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>. While this requires substantial floor layout changes and automation, it doubles output without building a new fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.
*   **Design-Side Improvements**: New tools and open-source initiatives (like the 130-nanometer PDK by Google and SkyWater Technologies) can make it easier for designers to create for or shrink designs onto different nodes, leading to faster and better chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.

The supply constraints for [[trailing_edge_semiconductor_demand_and_challenges | trailing edge chips]] are expected to continue until at least 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. However, growth in revenues for these nodes is slowing, and major players, along with China and India, are actively building new fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. An apparent slowing in the [[impact_of_macroeconomy_on_semiconductor_demand | macro economy]] could dampen overall demand, potentially aligning with new supply capacity entering the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.

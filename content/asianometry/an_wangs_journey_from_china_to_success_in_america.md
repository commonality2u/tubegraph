The narrative of [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Laboratories]] is deeply intertwined with the remarkable journey of its founder, An Wang, an "incredible engineer" and "brilliant businessman" [00:00:07]. His story is a quintessential American tale: a man from China who arrived with nothing, became a billionaire, and ultimately lost it all [00:00:18]. This article focuses on his rise to prominence and success in America.

## Early Life and Education in China

An Wang was born in 1920 into an upper-middle-class family in Shanghai, China [00:00:43]. His father, an educated man, was a teacher and a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine [00:00:49]. During Wang's youth, China was in a period of chaos, caught between Chiang Kai-shek's KMT party and Mao Zedong's Communist Party [00:00:54]. His family frequently moved to avoid conflict [00:01:03].

Wang began his schooling in the third grade, always being two years younger than his classmates [00:01:09]. Despite this, he excelled brilliantly in math and science, though less so in other subjects [00:01:18]. His "unusual but quiet confidence" in his abilities would shape his life [00:01:26]. At nine, he decided to take junior high exams himself, achieving first place [00:01:38].

At 13, Wang tested into Shanghai Provincial High School (now Shanghai High School) and left his family to attend [00:01:47]. He remained quiet and reserved, excelling in math and sciences but struggling with Chinese and English, never fully mastering the latter even as an adult [00:01:55]. After testing in the top 10 of his class, he earned a scholarship to Chaotong University (considered China's MIT), at just 16 years old [00:02:13].

During the Japanese invasion of China in late 1936, Wang's university and family fled to the French Concession of Shanghai [00:02:37]. Despite immense personal tragedy, including the deaths of his mother, father, and older sister under unclear circumstances, Wang graduated first in his class in 1941 [00:02:47]. After graduation, he joined the Chinese Central Radio Corporation, building radios for the Chinese Army in Guilin [00:02:59]. His colleagues recognized his potential, with the company president remarking, "he is very quiet but he is always thinking... he is very genius he will do something one day" [00:03:20]. In 1944, as the Japanese overran Guilin, Wang fled to Chongqing [00:03:33]. There, he won a government test to study in the United States [00:03:42].

## Arrival in the United States and Early Innovations

Wang arrived in the United States in 1945 and enrolled at Harvard to study Applied Physics [00:03:51]. He found the coursework "pretty easy" and earned a PhD in just 13 months [00:03:55]. During this time, he met Lorraine Chu, a woman from a prominent Shanghai family, and they married, later having three children: Fred, Courtney, and Juliet [00:04:02].

After his PhD, Wang joined the Harvard Computation Lab, working on the Mark I, one of the world's most powerful computers [00:04:15]. His focus was on the challenge of storing and reading large amounts of information without cumbersome mechanical steps [00:04:24]. He developed a crucial concept related to magnetic tape storage: "I could simply rewrite the information immediately afterward without any real sacrifice or speed" [00:04:42]. This concept became a core component of [[inventions_and_innovations_by_an_wang | magnetic core memory]], the precursor to modern RAM [00:04:57].

In 1949, encouraged by his wife, Wang applied for a patent for this invention [00:05:06]. This decision angered his Harvard colleagues, who believed such knowledge should be public [00:05:21]. Howard Aiken, his superior, claimed Wang "ran away with Harvard stuff and claimed it as a Zone" [00:05:27].

## Founding Wang Laboratories

By 1950, Harvard began to move away from commercially applicable fields, including computers [00:05:33]. Wang disagreed with this direction and decided to establish his own company [00:05:41]. Despite friends' attempts to dissuade him due to the prevalent racism against Chinese individuals (the Chinese Exclusion Act had only recently been repealed), his challenges with English, and lack of funds, Wang had "unshakable confidence" in himself [00:05:47]. He named the company after himself, Wang Laboratories, refusing suggestions to change it to something "more American" [00:06:06].

Wang Laboratories was founded on June 30, 1951, with just $600 in savings and An Wang as its sole asset [00:06:38]. He began by producing and selling [[inventions_and_innovations_by_an_wang | core memories]] for about four dollars each [00:06:48]. He personally handled all sales, methodically contacting clients [00:06:54]. In 1952, he approached IBM about licensing his pending patent on core memory [00:07:01].

Initially, business was slow, and Wang supplemented his income by teaching night courses [00:07:14]. However, his reputation grew, attracting custom consulting jobs [00:07:21]. He famously told a client, "first you show me all the ways you know how to do it after you have done that I will show you how to do it better" [00:07:26]. In 1953, he secured a consulting deal with IBM, which included a future option for them to buy his patent, providing the stability needed to hire employees [00:07:37]. Wang was recognized as not only a brilliant engineer but also a "sharp very tough businessman" unafraid to challenge IBM [00:07:51]. He was deeply involved in every aspect of his company, to the point where "the two are one and one" [00:08:10]. His management style, however, was demanding and micromanagerial [00:08:17].

In 1955, IBM paid Wang between $400,000 to $500,000 (roughly $4.4 to $5.5 million today) for his patent [00:08:32]. While good money, Wang's patent covered only a small part of the final core memory product, and IBM later paid Jay Wright Forrester $13 million for a more complete application [00:08:43]. This left Wang feeling he was "so close yet so far" [00:08:57]. This experience, however, allowed Wang to pivot from consulting to product development, though he harbored "special ill will" towards IBM for a long time [00:09:04].

## Product-Driven Growth and Public Offering

In the early 1960s, Wang partnered with Compugraphic to develop the [[inventions_and_innovations_by_an_wang | Linusac]], a machine that justified lines of text for publishers [00:09:16]. The Linusac was a hit, leading to rapid revenue growth for Wang Laboratories: $427,000 in 1962, $643,000 in 1963, and $1.4 million in 1964 [00:09:35]. However, when competitors emerged, Wang refused to lower prices, leading Compugraphic to produce the machine themselves [00:09:54]. This experience taught Wang "never to produce a product that he did not have full control over" [00:10:19].

Wang's first fully controlled success came in 1964 with a new calculator [00:10:24]. Recognizing the industry's shift from mechanical to solid-state electronics, he aimed to create a calculator with Mainframe capabilities but in a much smaller form factor [00:10:28]. He and a colleague developed [[inventions_and_innovations_by_an_wang | patented transistor logic]] capable of computing natural logarithms using only six pre-stored values in ROM [00:11:03]. This led to the [[inventions_and_innovations_by_an_wang | Logarithmic Calculating Instrument (LOCI)]], debuted in January 1965 [00:11:27]. Though expensive at $6,500 and difficult to use, LOCI was Wang's "first big hit," selling 10-20 units a month to science labs [00:11:44].

He then simplified the design, introducing the [[inventions_and_innovations_by_an_wang | Wang 300 calculator]] in 1966 [00:11:58]. Priced at $1,695 and easy to use, it was an "immediate hit," selling not only to scientists but also to stockbrokers and insurance companies [00:12:07]. The Wang 300 became legendary on Wall Street for uncovering a three-decade-old error in a bond trading table [00:12:20]. The company's name, once a potential hurdle, became a source of playful humor, with people joking Wang stood for "wild ass number grinders" [00:12:27].

Wang established a direct sales team, and revenues nearly tripled from $2.5 million in 1965 to $6.9 million in 1967 [00:12:33]. That same year, [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang Laboratories went public]] in a highly publicized IPO [00:12:44]. An Wang's personal stock holdings were then valued at $50 million [00:12:47].

## Transition to Computers and Word Processing Dominance

While calculators brought wealth, Wang sought the "next big thing" [00:12:53]. In 1968, the emergence of the BASIC computer language convinced him that computers were the future [00:12:58]. He acquired Phil Hankins Inc., a data processing company, and began developing two new computers: the Wang 700 and the Wang 3300 BASIC [00:13:06].

When Hewlett-Packard released their HP 9100, which was effectively a computer marketed as a calculator to avoid challenging IBM, Wang rushed out the [[inventions_and_innovations_by_an_wang | Wang 700]] in mid-1969 [00:13:17]. Like HP, Wang also called the 700 a calculator [00:13:47]. A year later, the 700 became Wang's most important product, driving revenues to $25 million [00:13:52].

However, Wang foresaw the impending "calculator market" decline due to microprocessors driving prices down [00:13:56]. In 1971, he made the "incredibly ballsy decision" to withdraw from the calculator market entirely, starting with lower-end models [00:14:26]. Though calculators constituted 75% of the company's revenue, Wang was confident that computers were the future [00:14:39].

His two-pronged strategy involved developing a general-purpose computer (the Wang 3300 BASIC, which was unsuccessful due to its difficulty of use) and a word processor to challenge IBM's Magnetic Tape Selectric electric typewriter [00:14:50]. IBM dominated 80% of the word processing market but paid it little attention, making it an ideal entry point for Wang [00:15:21]. The initial [[inventions_and_innovations_by_an_wang | Wang 1200 word processor]] (1971) faced reliability issues, leading to sluggish sales [00:15:32].

The company's fortunes turned with three key products:
1.  **Wang 2200 Computer (1973)**: A successor to the 3300 BASIC, the [[inventions_and_innovations_by_an_wang | 2200]] used Intel's ROM chips for instant wake capabilities [00:16:11]. Priced affordably ($6,000-$8,000), it became a capable small business computer and sold "extremely well for a decade and a half" [00:16:29].
2.  **Wang Word Processing System (WPS) (1976)**: Learning from the 1200's shortcomings, Wang tasked Harold Koplow and David Morris to redesign a word processor from the ground up [00:16:43]. They created a network of powerful machines, each with its own Intel 8080 microprocessor, capable of independent work or sharing documents [00:17:08]. They replaced IBM's typewriter with a CRT screen and simplified user interaction with built-in prompts and a menu system [00:17:20]. The [[inventions_and_innovations_by_an_wang | WPS]] was an "immediate hit," bringing the company "back from the brink" [00:17:46]. Huge lines formed at its trade show debut [00:18:02].
3.  **Wang VS Minicomputer (1977)**: Smaller and cheaper than IBM's mainframes but powerful enough for commercial applications like spreadsheets, the [[inventions_and_innovations_by_an_wang | VS minicomputer]] competed successfully against Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX line [00:18:20].

These three products, released in quick succession, "would generate billions for Wang" [00:18:47].

## Becoming a Household Name and a Billionaire

By the late 1970s, Wang was the world's largest supplier of CRT-based word processing systems [00:18:53]. Despite this, the company remained largely unknown, often still perceived as a calculator maker [00:19:01]. In 1978, the company launched a massive three-month TV advertising campaign to reposition itself as a leading computer maker [00:19:07]. The campaign culminated in a 30-second Super Bowl ad costing $150,000 [00:19:15]. Despite being only the 32nd largest computer maker, Wang was the only company besides IBM advertising on TV [00:19:21]. Their "attention grabbing David vs Goliath spot" directly attacked IBM and garnered significant public attention [00:19:29].

The campaign was a resounding success: awareness of Wang soared from 3% to 14% [00:19:40]. Wang's executives were so impressed they concealed the true extent of its success to deter imitators [00:19:47].

Wang's revenues doubled from 1978 to 1980, and again by 1982, reaching $1 billion [00:19:51]. By 1984, sales hit $2 billion [00:20:02]. In 1983, 80% of the largest U.S. firms bought Wang equipment, with nearly half the company's revenue coming from Fortune 500 companies [00:20:05].

In 1980, Dr. Wang turned 60 and began to slow down [00:20:15]. By 1982, he was spending less time in the office, formally retiring in 1983 while remaining chairman [00:20:20]. His personal stake in the company peaked in 1984 at over $1.6 billion, making him the richest man in New England and the fifth richest in America [00:23:11]. This marked the pinnacle of [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | Wang's fortunes]].# An Wang's Journey from China to American Success

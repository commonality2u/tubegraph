Scientists initially developed sodium-ion batteries concurrently with [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. However, [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion]] technology eventually rose to dominance, causing sodium-ion research to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Recently, there has been a significant resurgence of interest in sodium-ion batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Fundamental Structure and Early Challenges

[[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | Sodium-ion batteries]] share a similar structure with [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]], featuring a cathode, an anode, a porous separator, and an electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The main distinction lies in the different compounds used for their components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This similarity allows for potential shared engineering and production methods with [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Early development of [[commercialization_and_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] began in the early 20th century, following the discovery that molten salts could conduct high amounts of sodium ions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### The Sodium-Sulfur Battery

In 1968, scientists at Ford Company developed the sodium-sulfur battery for electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This battery consisted of a tube of metallic sodium dipped into a tube of liquid sulfur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Ford estimated that a 350-pound sodium-sulfur battery could provide 200 to 300 miles of range for a 1,350-pound car at 40 miles per hour, with a minimum charge time of half an hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

The biggest challenge for this technology was its operational temperature, requiring 570 to 660 degrees Fahrenheit (300 to 350 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. These high temperatures led to safety and longevity issues, particularly in cars, as aluminum-based container tubes would react with battery chemicals and rupture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Ford ultimately failed to [[commercialization_and_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | commercialize]] this technology for electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

Molten salt batteries, despite these challenges, found applications in guidance systems for missiles and extreme environments, such as the surface of Venus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Ford later sold this technology to NGK, a Japanese company, which now sells them as stationary battery solutions for peak energy use and grid stabilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

The oil crises of the 1970s renewed interest in this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. In 1985, South African researchers developed the "Zebra battery," a new molten salt battery using nickel chloride and sodium tetrachloroaluminate, which showed promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Dominance of Lithium-Ion and Renewed Interest in Sodium-Ion

In 1989, Sony successfully [[commercialization_and_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | commercialized]] the [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion battery]], whose advantages quickly gained widespread industry acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. From that point, research largely shifted towards [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion battery]] technologies, which currently dominate the industry, being the primary choice for electric vehicles, stationary batteries, and mobile gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

However, in the 2000s, concerns emerged regarding the [[raw_material_availability_and_costs_of_sodiumion_batteries | supply of raw materials]] for [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Key challenges include:
*   Limited natural sources of lithium, concentrated in four countries (Australia, Chile, China, Argentina), and difficult/environmentally unfriendly to extract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   Environmental and humanitarian concerns related to other critical elements like cobalt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   Extensive intellectual property rights (patents) surrounding [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion technologies]], posing challenges for new companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

In contrast, the global [[raw_material_availability_and_costs_of_sodiumion_batteries | supply of sodium is essentially unlimited]], with over 1,000 times more sodium than lithium in the Earth's crust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This translates to significantly lower [[raw_material_availability_and_costs_of_sodiumion_batteries | raw ingredient costs]]: $150 per ton for sodium compared to $5,000 for lithium, a 30-times decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. [[raw_material_availability_and_costs_of_sodiumion_batteries | Sodium-ion battery]] technologies also offer "far larger green fields" in terms of intellectual property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

These factors led to a renewed interest in [[commercialization_and_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] starting in the 2010s, with a focus on developing them for use at room temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The number of publications related to [[commercialization_and_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] has since rapidly increased, even surpassing those of [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Modern Sodium-Ion Battery Chemistry and Remaining Challenges

Researchers have largely converged on specific chemistries for modern room-temperature [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | sodium-ion batteries]]:
*   **Anodes**: Most studies focus on "hard carbon," colloquially described as charcoal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Electrolytes**: Generally, researchers use sodium salts dissolved in organic carbonate solvents, chosen for their low viscosity, high conductivity, and electrochemical stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Cathodes**: This area has seen significant research, as the cathode is the most expensive and critical component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   **Sodium Layered Oxides**: The most common and studied class, featuring a crystalline structure of metal oxides with sodium ions sandwiched between <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Their crystalline structures are similar to lithium cobalt oxide, the first legitimate cathode material in [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
    *   **Prussian White**: An analog of Prussian blue pigment, this material has been recognized for its suitability in [[comparative_analysis_of_different_battery_chemistries | sodium-ion battery]] cathodes since the early 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. It is cheap, easily made, non-toxic, offers good discharge rates, and can retain capacity over many cycles (e.g., 95% retention after 10,000 cycles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. A notable drawback is that they lose significant capacity in the presence of moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
    *   Other candidates include sulfides, phosphates, fluorophosphates, carbon phosphates, and vanadium-based polyanionic compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Energy Density and Performance Limitations

Despite rapid scientific progress and emerging commercial products, [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] face inherent limitations:
*   Sodium has a lower ionization potential (or energy) than lithium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   This results in [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] having lower energy densities and operating voltages compared to their [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion counterparts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. It remains unclear if they can ever match top-line [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

For example, an 18650-cell prototype by CNRS CEA in 2015 achieved about 90 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. A more advanced battery announced in 2020 by Washington State University and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory speculated a practical specific energy of about 160 Wh/kg, comparable to current [[technological_innovations_in_lfp_battery_production | lithium-ion phosphate batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Commercialization Efforts and Future Outlook

Several technology startups are working to [[commercialization_and_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | commercialize sodium-ion batteries]], including UK-based Faradion Limited, Sweden-based Altris AB, China-based HiNa Battery, and US-based Natron Energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

[[introduction_to_catls_sodiumion_battery | Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL)]], the world's largest battery company, recently unveiled their first-generation [[introduction_to_catls_sodiumion_battery | sodium-ion batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   Their anode uses hard carbon with a unique porous structure to extend cycle lifetime and improve sodium ion movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   Their cathode uses Prussian white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   CATL's first-generation battery targets energy densities of up to 160 Wh/kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, with a second generation aiming for over 200 Wh/kg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Given the similar engineering and manufacturing processes between [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | sodium]] and [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]], CATL can integrate their [[introduction_to_catls_sodiumion_battery | sodium-ion offerings]] into their existing [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion infrastructure]] and ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. While the [[trends_in_global_battery_material_prices_and_their_effects_on_the_market | cost savings]] won't be drastic due to process overlap, most will come from cheaper [[raw_material_availability_and_costs_of_sodiumion_batteries | raw materials]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. One paper estimates end-users could see 10% to 30% price savings with [[raw_material_availability_and_costs_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

CATL also highlights their battery system integration capabilities, allowing them to mix and match sodium and [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] into a single system, with the system prioritizing higher energy density [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion cells]] when sodium-ion falls short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

While [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] may not replace [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium]] in high-energy density applications like mobile phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, they show significant potential in:
*   Short-range electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   Stationary power systems, where space is less of a concern and lower energy density is acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. This includes energy storage for solar and wind renewables, where the [[raw_material_availability_and_costs_of_sodiumion_batteries | cost savings]] are particularly appreciated at scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

With major companies like CATL investing heavily, leveraging their size, manufacturing skill, and R&D, [[commercialization_and_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] may achieve their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

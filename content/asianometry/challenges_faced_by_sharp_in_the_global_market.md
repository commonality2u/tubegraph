Once known for a variety of iconic products, including mechanical pencils, calculators, and TVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, [[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp Corporation]] faced increasing difficulties from the turn of the 21st century. The company found itself trapped in an incredibly competitive business, attacked by foreign competitors, and ultimately ran out of money, leading to its sale to a Taiwanese electronics giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This marked the first foreign takeover of a major Japanese consumer electronics company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Economic Headwinds and Strategic Missteps (1990s-2000s)
Following the unraveling of Japan's real estate bubble, the domestic economy weakened. [[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp]] was also affected by a strong Yen, increasing wages, and the effects of manufacturing offshoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a>. This recession fundamentally shifted the direction of Japan's large electronics firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.

Cheap foreign imports challenged [[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp]]'s older products like fax machines, calculators, and microwave ovens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:54">[01:55:54]</a>. While some new products like the Viewcam camcorder were successful, others, such as the Wizard electronic organizer, never gained traction, and saturated categories like notebook PCs failed to generate sufficient profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. Profits declined throughout the 1990s, with net income falling to 24.8 billion yen in 1998, a nearly 50% year-over-year decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:22">[01:22:22]</a>.

## Over-reliance on LCD Technology
By 1998, [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCD panels]] and related products accounted for 30% of [[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp]]'s revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:42">[01:39:42]</a>. New president Katsuhiko Machida decided to streamline the company and reposition its [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCD business]] at its very center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>. This pivot towards displays was risky due to the emergence of intense competition from the rest of Asia, particularly Taiwan and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:17">[01:55:17]</a>.

[[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp]] decided to ditch its venerable CRT television business, dating back to 1953, and went all-in on [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCD televisions]], launching its Aquos TV brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:29">[01:55:29]</a>. While Aquos initially captured 80% global market share in the nascent [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCD TV]] market in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:40">[01:58:40]</a>, competitors like Samsung and LG quickly caught up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:17">[01:58:17]</a>.

### Fierce Competition and Oversupply
In early 2002, Samsung surprised [[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp]] and the rest of Japan's display industry by being the first to produce leading-edge 5th generation [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCDs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:22">[02:24:22]</a>. To maintain its lead, [[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp]] invested billions of yen into new TFT [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCD factories]] across Japan, including the massive Kameyama plant (costing $4 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:36">[01:36:36]</a>. This represented a significant bet on Japan-based production, despite many other Japanese companies offshoring their [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCD production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>.

However, the Kameyama plant came online at the same time as other massive facilities built by Taiwan's AU Optronics, Sony, Samsung, and LG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:54">[01:55:54]</a>. This led to a situation of oversupply in the [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCD panel industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:03">[02:02:03]</a>. A 32-inch TV panel that cost approximately $865 in 2004, dropped to about $149 by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:04">[02:04:04]</a>. Throughout the 2000s, [[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp]]'s TV market share plummeted from 80% to under 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:18">[02:07:18]</a>, as [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCD televisions]] became a cheap commodity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:29">[02:07:29]</a>.

### Failed Partnerships and Continued Losses
[[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp]]'s strategy to sell more [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCD panels]] to other businesses, aiming for a 50% external sales ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:32">[02:08:32]</a>, never cleared 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:37">[02:16:37]</a>. The company continued making massive investments into [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCD production]], cutting investments in home appliances to fund new factories like Sakai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:04">[02:14:04]</a>.

A planned partnership with Sony for the Sakai factories, where Sony would take a 33% ownership share, fell apart. [[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp]] failed to manage relations between its TV and display panel divisions, with its own Aquos TV sales taking precedence and leading to shortages and delays for Sony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:56">[02:22:56]</a>. Sony eventually sold its entire stake in the joint venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:18">[02:23:18]</a>.

The global financial crisis further exacerbated sales collapses and increased losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:34">[02:34:34]</a>. In March 2009, [[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp]] announced its first net loss since going public in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. Management admitted mistakes in investing in local production but continued to focus on [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCDs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:48">[02:39:48]</a>. By 2009, [[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp]]'s TV market share had fallen to just 6-7%, a third of Samsung's leading share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>. The new $3 billion Sakai plant operated at less than 50% utilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:18">[02:41:18]</a>.

[[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp]]'s inability to decide between being an [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCD panel]] supplier and a TV business led to losses in both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:24">[02:42:24]</a>. Sales declined by $10 billion from 2008 to March 2012, and the company reported a net loss of over $5 billion, nearing bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:31">[02:43:31]</a>.

## Missing Industry Transitions and Final Acquisition
Despite its technological prowess, [[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp]] missed several critical industry transitions, including the move towards LED-backlit [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCD screens]] and OLED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:56">[02:59:56]</a>. Furthermore, it lost its stronghold on the Japanese domestic smartphone market to Apple, one of its last hopes in consumer electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:22">[02:27:22]</a>.

After years of declining offers, [[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp]] finally accepted [[acquisition_of_sharp_by_foxconn | Foxconn]]'s offer in 2016 to purchase a controlling 66% stake for $6.2 billion, though the offer was revised down to $3.8 billion due to undisclosed financial liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:46">[02:47:46]</a>. This marked the first foreign takeover of a leading Japanese electronics firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:18">[02:55:18]</a>.

## Post-Acquisition Challenges and Reorientation
Under [[acquisition_of_sharp_by_foxconn | Foxconn]]'s Taiwanese management, [[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp]] has sought to cut costs, closing unprofitable overseas ventures, reducing employees, and moving production out of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:31">[02:53:31]</a>. [[acquisition_of_sharp_by_foxconn | Foxconn]] has also begun rebuilding [[rise_and_fall_of_sharp_corporation | Sharp]]'s semiconductor manufacturing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:54">[02:56:54]</a>.

The company's fall was attributed not to a lack of technology, but to a failure to use technology to produce the right products at the right time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:19">[02:59:19]</a>. Its deep dive into [[sharps_involvement_in_the_lcd_and_electronics_industry | LCDs]] and unwavering confidence in its technological superiority proved detrimental, as display panels became a "brutal grinding business with low margins and high insecurity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:30">[02:59:30]</a>.

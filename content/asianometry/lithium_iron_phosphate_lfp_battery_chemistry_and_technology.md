In 2024, [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | lithium-ion battery pack prices]] experienced their largest price cut since 2017, falling 20% to $115 per kilowatt-hour, making Chinese batteries cheaper even with high tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This trend is largely driven by advancements in Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) battery technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Once considered a cheap, low-end option with fundamental chemistry weaknesses, LFP batteries have seen significant engineering improvements, particularly in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## The Three Chemistries

[[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage | Lithium-ion batteries]] consist of two electrodes: a cathode and an anode, with the anode typically being graphite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The cathode is the most expensive component, accounting for over 70% of the battery's value, and is used to distinguish between different battery chemistries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

There are three major [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage | lithium-ion battery]] chemistries:
*   **Ternary Batteries**: These include Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) and Nickel Cobalt Aluminum (NCA), named for the three materials mixed in their cathodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
    *   **Advantages**: Higher energy densities, allowing for lighter battery packs and longer electric vehicle (EV) ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
    *   **Disadvantages**: Utilize rarer, more expensive materials like nickel and cobalt, which constitute about 70% of the battery's raw material cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Their higher energy densities also increase thermal risks, potentially leading to thermal runaway (fire) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Energy densities for NCA range from 230 to 260 watt-hours per kilogram, and NMC from 250 to 320 watt-hours per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) Batteries**: These use a dual-chemistry cathode made from iron phosphate, containing no cobalt or nickel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   **Advantages**: Significantly lower cost due to the abundance of iron and phosphorus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. They also maintain their initial energy capacity better after many charge/discharge cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The lower energy density also reduces risks of thermal runaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   **Disadvantages**: Suffer from lower energy densities, typically 90 to 160 watt-hours per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This means EVs powered by LFP batteries generally have shorter ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

In essence, LFP batteries excel in cost and safety, while NMC and NCA batteries offer superior performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Battle of the Batteries

Early [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage | lithium-ion batteries]] were Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCOs), which used a high amount of cobalt (0.95 kg per kg-hour of energy capacity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Concerns over economic, moral, and environmental sustainability due to cobalt sourcing from the Democratic Republic of Congo led to the rise of ternary chemistries like NCA, NMC, and Lithium Manganese Oxide (LMO), which used significantly less cobalt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Western EV pioneers such as the Chevrolet Volt, Nissan Leaf, and Tesla Model S adopted ternary cathode chemistries in the 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Meanwhile, [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | China's]] early EV manufacturers adopted LFP batteries, particularly for public service fleets like buses, influenced by government industrial policies such as the 2009 "Thousands of Vehicles, Tens of Cities" (TVTC) program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Chinese companies like BYD became early pioneers in LFP due to cost and safety advantages, leading to LFP dominance in the Chinese EV industry for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

However, in late 2016, the Chinese government changed its subsidy policies to incentivize EVs more attractive to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Subsidies were linked to factors like higher energy density, longer driving ranges, and faster charging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This policy favored ternary battery chemistries, causing LFP's market share to fall to 30% by mid-2019, with even loyal LFP adopters like BYD switching to ternary batteries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### The Subsidies Withdraw and LFP Revitalization

Two major developments reversed this trend and revitalized LFP:
1.  **Withdrawal of Subsidies**: Starting in June 2019, the Chinese government began gradually withdrawing its EV cash subsidies, which had become significant and prone to "subsidy cheating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The aggressive 50% reduction in mid-2019 leveled the cost playing field, prompting EV makers to switch back to LFP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
2.  **New Technologies**: LFP makers simultaneously introduced new technologies to address the chemistry's weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Technological Advancements

### Blade Battery and Cell-to-Pack (CTP)

BYD introduced the Blade battery in March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Traditional EV battery manufacturing involves three levels: cells, modules, and packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Cells are the fundamental blocks, grouped into modules to simplify integration into the final battery pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

BYD's Blade battery entirely skips the module stage, integrating cells directly into the battery pack, a concept known as Cell-to-Pack (CTP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This approach maximizes the pack's volume, compensating for LFP's lower energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. The Blade uses a prismatic cell form factor, a long, ultra-thin shape encased in a rigid rectangular metal casing that provides structural integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

The Blade battery was a game-changer, enabling BYD's 2020 Han EV to achieve a range of 605 kilometers (NEDC) with LFP batteries, comparable to premium EVs using ternary batteries but at a significantly lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. CTP technology allows LFP battery packs to reach about 85% of a conventional NMC battery's energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Ternary batteries struggle to adopt CTP due to higher operating temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

Following BYD's success, other major Chinese EV battery makers, such as [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries | CATL]], adopted CTP technology with products like their Qilin battery pack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This led to LFP battery volumes overtaking NMC in 2021, accounting for nearly 70% of EV installations by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. NMC batteries are now primarily reserved for premium, high-performance vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### New Production Methods

LFP makers are also exploring new production methods and recipes to meet demands for more range and faster charging:
*   **Lithium Manganese Iron Phosphate (LMFP)**: By adding manganese, LMFP batteries achieve higher energy density than standard LFP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **"Double Firing" (二烧)**: This process addresses issues with uneven grain growth and poor carbon coatings in traditional single-fired LFP production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. In "double firing," precursors are partially fired at a lower temperature, then milled and carbon-coated before a second firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This yields more uniform particles and better, more consistent performance suitable for long-range, fast-charging EVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

## Patents

The [[the_influence_of_patents_on_lfp_battery_development | influence of patents]] played a significant role in LFP's development. The fundamental [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage | lithium-ion battery]] structure and the LFP cathode were pioneered and patented by American scientist and Nobel laureate Dr. John Goodenough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. However, Goodenough's initial LFP design had poor electrical conductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

Later, key innovations in carbon coating and process technologies, patented by researchers in Canada and Europe, made LFP commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. These patents were consolidated under a Swiss entity managing global licensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

According to the IEA, a deal in the 2000s or 2010s allowed Chinese battery makers to use these LFP battery patents for free, but only for their local markets, while others paid licensing fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This "patent shield" enabled [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | Chinese companies]] to develop expertise in LFP, while the rest of the world pursued non-LFP structures to avoid patent issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. These patents expired in 2022, opening up LFP chemistry for foreign battery makers, but by then, Chinese companies had already built immense LFP supply chain proficiency, including CTP innovations, economies of scale, and material sourcing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

## Competition and Price Trends

Until 2021, BYD practiced vertical integration, only supplying batteries for its own cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. In 2021, BYD began selling its Blade batteries to third parties like Toyota and Ford, introducing a major new Tier 1 battery supplier and triggering a price war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. This intensified the already competitive [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | Chinese EV market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

A significant factor in the [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | lithium-ion battery price crash]] after 2022 was a concurrent crash in raw material prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. Raw materials constitute 70-80% of a battery cell's cost, and for LFP, 80% of that material cost is attributed to iron phosphate and lithium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. New lithium sources in Australia, Chile, and Argentina came online in 2023, reversing a 2022 shortage and causing prices to crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Iron prices also fell due to [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | China's]] real estate crisis, which reduced crude steel production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. These falling raw material costs allow [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | Chinese EV battery makers]] to cut battery prices while maintaining profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. For example, CATL's gross profit margins rose from 19.2% to 24.4% despite a 9% decline in revenues in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

## Utility-Scale Applications

The crashing [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | prices of LFP batteries]] have also had spillover effects beyond EVs, particularly in utility-scale stationary energy storage systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. These Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) store power from renewable sources like wind or solar during low demand times for later use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

LFP batteries were already favored for BESS before 2021 due to their lower material costs and resistance to thermal runaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. The [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | Chinese EV boom]] in 2021 further accelerated the adoption of BESS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. While BESS typically provide less power duration (1-2 hours) than pumped storage (4-12 hours), they are incredibly cheap and simple to build, often contained within standard-sized shipping containers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. Billions of dollars are being invested in BESS projects, especially in California and Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | Chinese EV]] and stationary battery industries continue to advance, with analysts predicting continued but slower [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | falls in LFP prices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. A notable future development to watch is the progress of [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development | sodium-ion battery]] technology, pursued by companies like [[catls_first_generation_sodiumion_batteries | CATL]], BYD, and Huawei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. While [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] face energy density shortcomings against [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion]], sodium is more accessible and shows promise for faster charging, with improving energy density numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

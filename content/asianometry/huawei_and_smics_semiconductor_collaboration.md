In late August 2023, Huawei quietly reintroduced its own phone chips to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02"></a>. The [[huaweis_reintroduction_of_phone_chips_and_the_mate_60_pro | Huawei Mate 60 Pro]] was made available in its online store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10"></a>, featuring the Kirin 9000s (麒麟9000s) system-on-chip (SOC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16"></a>. This chip is a 7-nanometer class product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19"></a>. While Huawei did not explicitly name the manufacturer, it is widely believed to be [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23"></a>.

## The Phone and the Chip

The [[huaweis_reintroduction_of_phone_chips_and_the_mate_60_pro | Mate 60 Pro]] is described as a "very nice phone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38"></a>. TechInsights reports the Kirin 9000s as a 107 square millimeter die, approximately 2% larger than the Kirin 9000 and 9000E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40"></a>. These previous leading-edge chips were briefly produced using TSMC's 5-nanometer process before American sanctions halted the association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54"></a>.

The new 7-nanometer class Kirin 9000s is about 5-6 years behind the current leading edge, as TSMC has been shipping 3-nanometer class chips throughout 2023 for products like the iPhone 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03"></a>.

Teardowns and speed tests suggest the Kirin 9000s supports 5G connectivity, though Huawei appears to be concealing this functionality. Their press releases do not mention 5G support, and the phone's operating system reports 4G on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15"></a>. The SoC's CPU core is a customization of Arm IP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49"></a>, and its GPU seems to be a new custom design by Huawei or HiSilicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55"></a>, which initially caused texture errors in games like Genshin Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58"></a>.

Regarding manufacturing, Dylan Patel of SemiAnalysis noted that [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]]'s early yields for this node are likely to be higher than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06"></a>. Yields typically start low but improve as the fabrication facility (fab) refines its process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17"></a>. The more phones Huawei sells, the faster [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] can improve yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26"></a>. Despite limited official information, the 7nm chip is real, and the node that produced it appears to be highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31"></a>.

## Why the Surprise?

The appearance of this chip should not have been surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48"></a>. Prior information suggested the expectation of a HiSilicon chip (which is Huawei) using the [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC N+2 process node]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52"></a>. Furthermore, Nikkei Asia had previously reported that [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] was collaborating with Huawei on a new 5G chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11"></a>.

News of the [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC N+2 process]] first emerged in July 2022, when it was being utilized for Bitcoin miners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20"></a>. Bitcoin miners, with their repetitive structures, serve as good use cases for improving a node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29"></a>. Producing a phone SOC like the Kirin 9000s, however, is a significantly more complex undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36"></a>. The successful production of this chip demonstrates the remarkable progress achieved by SMIC's Co-CEO Liang Mong-song and the company in approximately a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41"></a>.

## More Chips are Coming

Even more advanced chips are expected from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54"></a>. In January 2022, Dr. Burn Lin, a former TSMC R&D director and colleague of Liang Mong-song, stated that [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] could fabricate even 5-nanometer class chips using only multi-patterning with 193-nanometer immersion lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58"></a>. Immersion lithography, while 1-2 decades old, remains a critical technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15"></a>.

Despite US bans on EUV lithography exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26"></a>, 193-nanometer immersion machines (like the Twinscan NXT 2000i) still perform 70-80% of the lithography work for Intel, TSMC, and Samsung's latest nodes, and likely for the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42"></a>. The US administration initially held back from a 193i ban due to concerns about cooperation from Japan and the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58"></a>. It wasn't until June 30, 2023, that the Netherlands and Japan joined the US in imposing export restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09"></a>. ASML, a major supplier, has been actively selling DUV immersion machines before these restrictions fully take effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17"></a>.

This means [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] possesses a sufficient number of these machines to scale up 7-nanometer production and advance towards 5-nanometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25"></a>. While challenges exist regarding machine breakdown, spare parts, and potential sanction expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33"></a>, a 5-nanometer class Huawei chip is fully expected within 1-2 years, likely already specced out in a Huawei/SMIC lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40"></a>.

## A China-Only Supply Line is Emerging

The [[huaweis_reintroduction_of_phone_chips_and_the_mate_60_pro | Mate 60 Pro]] signifies more than just a high-performing chip; it is embedded within an ecosystem of domestic Chinese suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58"></a>. These suppliers have collaborated to create a phone with feature parity to market standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01"></a>. Bloomberg noted the phone's many domestic suppliers, including the radio frequency front-end module and the satellite communications modem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10"></a>. With the exception of memory (which appears to be from SK Hynix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20"></a>, the entire phone is essentially a China-only ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25"></a>.

This establishes the groundwork for a complete, self-contained ecosystem within the People's Republic of China, capable of producing various domestic electronics, including smartphone SOCs, CPUs, edge AI NPUs, GPUs, and AI accelerators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31"></a>.

## AI is the Next Big Move

While a phone chip comparable to one released five years ago might not seem groundbreaking globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49"></a>, it poses a significant challenge for Qualcomm, Apple, and MediaTek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54"></a>. Ming-chi Kuo indicated that Qualcomm sells tens of millions of chips for Huawei phones, sales now likely to be replaced by the Kirin 9000s and similar domestic chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58"></a>. Dylan Patel observes that every non-Chinese semiconductor maker and Apple will lose business to this new domestic chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08"></a>.

[[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] is expected to be occupied with Huawei orders for the next year or so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18"></a>. However, the next strategic move would be to seek new [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | N+2 node]] customers in high-powered computing, specifically to partner in creating a domestic AI accelerator (a Chinese version of the Nvidia A100 or TPU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23"></a>. A Chinese 7-nanometer AI accelerator is fully anticipated within 1-2 years, potentially designed by Biren, Baidu, Alibaba Cloud, or Tencent, barring further sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38"></a>.

## What China Does Next

China is actively developing its native semiconductor and technology ecosystem, a commendable effort given the impact of sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55"></a>. From a semiconductor manufacturing perspective, the primary objective should be to widely distribute this phone to as many consumers as possible, as scale is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05"></a>. Selling millions more units to Chinese domestic consumers, as well as to Europeans, Australians, Southeast Asians, and Latin Americans, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14"></a>.

This may be challenging due to Huawei phones not shipping with Google products, but Huawei is undertaking influencer marketing to guide users on installing Google products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27"></a>. Every export sale not only impacts Western phone makers but also strengthens [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39"></a>. Increased chip sales lead to higher production, faster yield improvements, and enhanced profitability, allowing [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] to fund its transition to 5-nanometer more quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46"></a>.

Additionally, [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] should focus on reviewing and replicating advanced packaging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57"></a>. While phone chips prioritize thinness and heat management (using methods like Chip Scale Packaging) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03"></a>, advanced AI applications require considerations like data bandwidth, necessitating new packaging architectures such as chiplets and 2.5D die-stacking, which are not impossible for China to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09"></a>.

The Chinese Government will also need to bolster its domestic semiconductor manufacturing equipment ecosystem, aiming to replace foreign suppliers like ASML, Applied Materials, Tokyo Electron, Lam Research, and metrology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24"></a>. Foreign equipment likely contains "kill switches," making self-reliance a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36"></a>.

## What America Does Next

According to Jordan Schneider of ChinaTalk, the US Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security justified cutting off foreign support for "advanced semiconductors" (logic ICs at 16/14nm or below or using non-planar transistor architecture) due to their implications for military modernization, including weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and human rights abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01"></a>. The US government believes that China's ability to manufacture advanced logic chips has significant implications for the regional military balance of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37"></a>.

Given the progress by [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] and Huawei, if the US government views a Chinese 7-nanometer node as a national security threat, it may intensify efforts to stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49"></a>. This requires a better understanding of which semiconductor manufacturing equipment is still entering China, as [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] remains dependent on foreign equipment, with domestic suppliers still years behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03"></a>.

Currently, companies like Applied Materials, Lam Research, Tokyo Electron, and KLA can sell most of their tools (for deposition, etch, metrology, epitaxy, etc.) which can be used for 7nm and even 5nm, plausibly under the guise of 28nm production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16"></a>. These tools are being sold to entities like [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] ostensibly for lagging-edge nodes, but are almost certainly being repurposed for chips like the Kirin 9000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35"></a>.

To prevent China from developing leading-edge capacity at scale, the US government, in cooperation with allies like Japan, the Netherlands, and Germany, should consider tighter export controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47"></a>. These controls should target tools currently being repurposed, such as Argon Fluoride Immersion lithography, mask, and CMP equipment, and implement far less liberal use of licenses for firms like [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]] on the entity list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58"></a>.

## Conclusion

The emergence of the Kirin 9000s chip, enabled by [[smics_7nm_process_and_n2_node | SMIC]], is a significant moment in technology history, reminiscent of Samsung's achievement in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43"></a>. Samsung shocked Japan by closing the Korean-Japanese semiconductor gap from five years to one with their 1 megabit DRAM chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18"></a>, achieving parity two years later with a 4 megabit chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31"></a>.

The People's Republic of China is adopting a similar "Korean approach" to semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54"></a>. This strategy proved successful for South Korea and is now demonstrating results for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58"></a>.

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Immediately following [[impact_of_world_war_ii_on_japanese_economy | World War II]], Japan experienced a severe [[postwar_methamphetamine_panic_and_its_societal_effects_in_japan | methamphetamine panic]] due to widespread addiction and related crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. By 1948, an estimated 5% of Japanese males aged 16 to 25 were addicted to methamphetamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Another survey revealed that 30% of individuals aged 20 to 22 had either tried or were currently using stimulants like amphetamines and meth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Headlines frequently reported attacks by delusional meth addicts, and this stimulant abuse significantly altered the country's perception of such drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Origins of Methamphetamine in Japan

The substance now known as methamphetamine was first synthesized by a Japanese scientist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. [[dr_nagayoshi_nagai_and_the_discovery_of_methamphetamine | Dr. Nagayoshi Nagai]], one of the first Japanese scientists to train abroad, traveled to Berlin in 1871 and worked for 12 years under chemist August Wilhelm von Hoffman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. His notable discoveries in synthetic vanilla led the Japanese government to request his return to help establish a pharmaceutical industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Upon his return to Japan, Dr. Nagai began researching the herb Chinese ephedra, also known as ma Hwang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This shrub, used in traditional Chinese medicine for over 5,000 years to treat coughs, fevers, and induce sweating, grows in Mongolia and northeastern China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. In 1885, Nagai isolated one of the four forms of ephedrine from the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. In 1893, he synthesized methamphetamine, originally named M33N, as it was his 33rd extract from the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Crystal Meth Synthesis and Effects

A few decades later, in 1919, Akira Ogata, one of Nagai's students at the University of Tokyo, synthesized a more potent variant called crystal meth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Crystal meth easily crosses the blood-brain barrier, triggering a release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine (which induces feelings of well-being), norepinephrine (priming for fight-or-flight responses), and serotonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This results in a rapid rush of energy and euphoria that can last 8 to 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

However, excessive use can lead to hallucinations, delusions, and sleeplessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Withdrawal symptoms often include decreased energy, anxiety, irritability, and disrupted sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Injecting methamphetamine provides a faster high, and shared needles among users contribute to higher rates of HIV and hepatitis C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Initially, meth was used in Japan as a cough suppressant, bronchodilator for asthmatics, or to treat depression with lethargic symptoms, but it was not widely popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Wartime Use and Commercialization

In 1938, during [[impact_of_world_war_ii_on_japanese_economy | World War II]], the German Army adopted methamphetamine (Pervitin) for its stimulant effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom learned of this, leading researchers like Kenosuke Miura to advocate for its adoption in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Miura's Dai Nippon Pharmaceutical Company produced "Philopon" (or "Hedopon"), the most popular meth brand, introduced in 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The name "Philopon" literally means "loving labor" and became synonymous with stimulants for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

In 1941, the Japanese government approved the unlimited commercial sale of both amphetamine and methamphetamine, with the latter becoming more popular due to its addictiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The drugs were marketed as "Awakening drugs" or "wakeamines," advertised for "night work and other times demanding mental alertness" or "over exertion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

As [[impact_of_world_war_ii_on_japanese_economy | World War II]] progressed, the [[methamphetamine_use_in_the_japanese_military_during_world_war_ii | Japanese military adopted methamphetamine]] for the war effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>:
*   **Sentries** on night duty received "cat eye tablets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Munitions factory workers** received tablets to work through the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Kamikaze and special forces** took "storming tablets," a mix of meth and green tea powder stamped with the emperor's crest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Air pilots** reportedly received meth injections, told they were "nighttime vision hormones" imported from Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Postwar records suggest these might have been melanotropins extracted from cows and pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

The military stockpiled massive quantities of these meth drugs, referring to them as a "Mainland decisive battle weapon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## Postwar Crisis Emergence

After the war, Japan was in a [[impact_of_world_war_ii_on_japanese_economy | ruinous situation]], marked by chaos, unemployment, and severe food shortages exacerbated by millions of returning soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Many Japanese turned to alcohol and drugs to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Signs of a meth crisis appeared as early as September 1946, when Tokyo's first meth addict was hospitalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

The drugs fueling this crisis came from three main sources:
*   **Pharmaceutical companies** began dumping their massive wartime supplies into the civilian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. These 20 companies heavily advertised, believing they were helping rebuild the country and profit in a terrible economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Meth was often cheaper than alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Military drug stockpiles** leaked out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Despite efforts by American occupation forces and Japanese-American *nisei* to seize and destroy them, many caches scattered in hospitals, supply depots, and caves slipped through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Informal markets and crime gangs** diverted drugs through corrupt servicemen and street gangs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Methamphetamine, referred to as "Shabu" (meaning speed), was easily manufactured in small labs using ingredients from Hong Kong pharmacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

Many Japanese soldiers took their pills home, ignorant of the drugs' hazardous side effects, believing them harmless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. When their initial supply ran out, they bought more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Contemporary documents reflected this lack of awareness, often noting the "seeming positive upsides" of these drugs on work attitudes and stamina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Changing Public Attitudes and Early Controls

Two publicly attributed deaths helped shift public opinion against stimulants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>:
*   In October 1946, comedian Miss Wakana died of a heart attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   In January 1947, novelist Sakonosuke Oda died of a hemorrhage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
While their deaths were likely not directly due to meth overdose (Wakana was clean for two years, Oda likely died from tuberculosis), newspapers seized on their known drug habits and attributed the deaths to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

In 1949, the [[government_and_police_actions_to_control_methamphetamine_in_japan | Japanese government]] began considering controls on Philopon distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The debate in the National Diet initially focused on street orphans who lost parents to meth addiction and committed crimes to fund their own habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Over time, Diet members and Ministry of Health and Welfare staff concluded that the root cause was adult dealers and smugglers, not the children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

Many ordinary Japanese still believed meth had a positive societal role, particularly as a work productivity booster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. An editorial in the *Journal of the Japan Medical Association* noted that journalists regularly used it for productivity, excusing it as a necessity due to demanding work hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Blame often fell on "immoral people" like entertainers and novelists who "abused" the drug, while "moral people" like office workers were seen as capable of using it "healthily" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Legislative Response and Early Challenges

In October 1950, a "mass sexual assault incident" near Urawa City in Saitama led to the arrest of about 100 young people suffering from hallucinations and delusions linked to "Neo-Agotine" (a meth drug by Toyama Chemical) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Toyama Chemical was found to have produced over 10 million vials monthly, far exceeding its quota of 51,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. However, since the quota was a bureaucratic guideline rather than law, Toyama was fined only $14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

This incident underscored the need for better controls. In June 1951, Japan passed the [[government_and_police_actions_to_control_methamphetamine_in_japan | Stimulant Control Act of 1951]], criminalizing the import, manufacture, trafficking, receipt, and possession of these drugs, especially when associated with other crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. The police rapidly implemented the law, arresting 17,528 people for stimulant-related offenses in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

However, the initial law lacked teeth, with a maximum three-year prison sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. This crackdown shifted meth production from informal labs to organized crime, such as the Yakuza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Peak of the Crisis and Stricter Measures

By 1954, the epidemic worsened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. An anonymous census found that 7.5% of 127,142 respondents aged 15-30 used methamphetamine, with 75% of those injecting over five vials daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The Ministry estimated over half a million abusers nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

Meth-linked crimes were rampant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. A pivotal moment was the April 1954 violation and murder of young Kyoko Hasada in a school bathroom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. The perpetrator, 20-year-old meth addict Shikichi Sakamaki, was captured with 500 vials of meth and two needles, stating, "Even I myself cannot understand why I committed such a crime. Maybe it was hitopon that led me to do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

This murder triggered an avalanche of meth-related headlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Examples included an office worker stabbed by a stranger, and a 21-year-old addict pushing three children to their deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. In May 1954, half of the 60 reported murders were linked to meth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The media fueled the panic, with the three biggest newspapers running drug-related headlines 43 times between July and December 1954, declaring it a time of "moral decay" or "moral insanity" in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

In June 1954, Japan amended its [[government_and_police_actions_to_control_methamphetamine_in_japan | Stimulant Control Act]] to crack down harder on the drug trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Arrests skyrocketed; four months later, 6,000 people were arrested for methamphetamine offenses (46% for possession, the rest for usage or buying) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. The police reorganized, focusing on both demand and supply, conducting massive raids like one in Osaka in July 1954 involving 2,000 officers searching 800 buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Indictments surged from 43% in 1953 to 63%, and over 9,000 violators were jailed for stimulant-related offenses between 1951 and 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

## Public Awareness Campaigns

The police heavily invested in public awareness campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Case study interviews revealed common patterns: users started innocently, unaware of dangers, perhaps for studying or productivity, then unexpectedly became addicted, leading to hallucinations and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Recognizing that 50% of addicts took their first dose between ages 15 and 24, the police aimed to inform young people about the dangers of stimulants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

Over 24 million yen was spent on posters telling people to avoid stimulant drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. The police distributed 225,000 pamphlets, 470,000 leaflets, and 385,000 posters nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Posters ranged from optimistic calls to "Wipe Out the evil of stimulant drugs" to gruesome images of syringes plunged into a teenage boy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Special focus was placed on students preparing for stressful year-end examinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Lectures, roundtable discussions, and presentations were held in schools, factories, workplaces, and nightclubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:15:01]</a>. Combined with a media blitz, these efforts ensured that by 1955, only 3% of youths had never heard of Hiropon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

## Blame and Discrimination

Public blame was often directed at foreign Korean and Taiwanese populations, euphemistically called "Third Country residents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. A nationalist narrative emerged, portraying the epidemic as originating from "bad forces abroad," possibly Communists, who smuggled drugs into the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. This narrative helped shift public attitudes against methamphetamine use by painting it as a threat to Japan's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. In 1954, the Tokyo Police claimed 70% of illegal meth labs were run by Koreans, failing to note that Japanese police specifically targeted Korean villages east of Tokyo for drug raids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. This dubious data exacerbated problems for ethnic minorities who already faced discrimination and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

## Resolution and Aftermath

Sustained [[government_and_police_actions_to_control_methamphetamine_in_japan | police activity]] succeeded in reducing drug crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. By 1957, census data showed a decline in methamphetamine use among the Japanese population, and offenses and arrests began to fall year after year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. By 1962, the so-called "Heropon Panic" had largely ended, with meth-related arrests declining to 300 to 800 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

However, this did not mean addicts stopped using drugs; many young people switched to sniffing solvents, with related crimes skyrocketing to 20,000 in 1968 and 50,000 in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

The [[postwar_methamphetamine_panic_and_its_societal_effects_in_japan | postwar meth crisis]] in Japan can be attributed to abundant legal and illegal supply, a lack of awareness about the drug's addictiveness, and terrible economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. The situation was reversed by addressing the first two elements and an alleviation of the third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

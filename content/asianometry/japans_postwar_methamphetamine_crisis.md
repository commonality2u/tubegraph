From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

In the years immediately following [[World War II Japan | World War II]], Japan experienced a significant public health crisis due to widespread methamphetamine addiction, often referred to as the "heropon panic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. By 1948, an estimated 5% of Japanese males aged 16 to 25 were addicted to methamphetamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Another survey found that 30% of people aged 20 to 22 had either tried or were currently taking stimulants like amphetamines and meth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This epidemic caught the public by surprise and drastically altered [[cultural_and_societal_attitudes_towards_meth_in_postwar_japan | Japan's cultural and societal attitudes towards such drugs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Origins of Methamphetamine

Methamphetamine was first discovered by a Japanese scientist, [[dr_nagayoshi_nagai_and_the_discovery_of_methamphetamine | Dr. Nagayoshi Nagai]].
[[dr_nagayoshi_nagai_and_the_discovery_of_methamphetamine | Dr. Nagayoshi Nagai]] was among the first Japanese scientists to train abroad, studying in Berlin from 1871 for 12 years under chemist August Wilhelm von Hoffman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. His notable discoveries in synthetic vanilla led the Japanese government to ask him to return and help establish a pharmaceutical industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

In Japan, Nagai began researching the Chinese herb *ephedra*, also known as *ma Hwang*, a shrub found in Mongolia and northeastern China known for its use in traditional Chinese medicine for coughs, fevers, and inducing sweating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. In 1885, he isolated ephedrine from the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Then, in 1893, Nagai synthesized methamphetamine, originally named "m33n" as it was his 33rd extract from the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Its significance was largely overlooked at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Later, in 1919, Akira Ogata, one of Nagai's students at the University of Tokyo, synthesized a more potent variant known as crystal meth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Effects of Crystal Meth

Crystal meth easily crosses the blood-brain barrier, triggering an avalanche of neurotransmitters like dopamine (creating euphoria), norepinephrine (priming for fight or flight), and to a lesser extent, serotonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This results in a quick, long-lasting rush of energy and euphoria, typically 8 to 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. However, excessive use can lead to hallucinations, delusions, and sleeplessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Withdrawal symptoms include decreased energy, anxiety, irritability, and disrupted sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Injecting methamphetamine for a faster high often leads to shared needles and higher rates of HIV and Hepatitis C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Initially, meth was used in Japan as a cough suppressant, bronchodilator for asthmatics, or to treat depression with lethargic symptoms, but it was not widely popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## [[role_of_methamphetamine_in_world_war_ii_japan | Methamphetamine's Role in World War II Japan]]

The use of methamphetamine dramatically increased during World War II. In 1938, the German Army adopted it under the brand name Pervitin for its stimulant effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Japanese researchers, like Kenosuke Miura, encouraged their government to follow suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Miura's pharmaceutical company, Dai Nippon Pharmaceutical Company, produced the popular meth brand "Philopon" (or "Hiropon"/"Hedopon"), introduced in 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The name "Philopon" literally means "loving labor" and became synonymous with all stimulants for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

In 1941, the government approved the commercial sale of both amphetamine and methamphetamine without limitation, with the more addictive methamphetamine becoming more popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. These drugs were marketed as "Awakening drugs" or "Wakeamines," advertised for "night work and other times demanding mental alertness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

As the war progressed, the Japanese military extensively adopted methamphetamine for the war effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>:
*   **Sentries** on night duty received "cat eye tablets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Munitions factory workers** received tablets to work through the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Kamikaze and special forces** took "storming tablets," a special meth tablet mixed with green tea powder and stamped with the emperor's crest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

While primarily distributed as tablets, some air pilots reportedly received meth injections, believing them to be "nighttime vision hormones" imported from Germany, though post-war records suggest these were likely melanotropins extracted from cows and pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The military stockpiled vast amounts, calling them "Mainland decisive battle weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Post-War Crisis Eruption

Following Japan's defeat, the country was in chaos with widespread joblessness, food shortages, and millions of returning soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Many Japanese turned to alcohol and drugs to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. The first meth addict was admitted to a Tokyo hospital as early as September 1946 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

The drugs fueling this crisis came from three main sources:
1.  **Pharmaceutical Companies:** Drug makers dumped their massive wartime stockpiles into the civilian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. These 20 companies heavily advertised, believing they were helping the Japanese people overcome tiredness while rebuilding the country, and also seeking to profit in the struggling [[postwar_economic_reforms_in_japan | economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Meth was often cheaper than alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
2.  **Military Stockpiles:** Large military drug caches, intended for destruction by American occupation forces, leaked into circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
3.  **Informal Markets and Crime Gangs:** Drugs were "diverted" through corrupt servicemen and street gangs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Methamphetamine, known as "Shabu" (meaning speed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, was easily manufactured in small labs using ingredients from Hong Kong pharmacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Many returning soldiers simply took their pills home, ignorant of the side effects, and continued buying once their personal stash ran out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Public Perception and Turning Points

Initially, many Japanese, including journalists, were unfamiliar with the harmful downsides of meth, believing it to be harmless and even positive for work productivity and stamina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. An editorial in the *Journal of the Japan Medical Association* noted that journalists regularly used meth for productivity, excusing it by blaming insufficient company pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Blame often fell on "immoral people" like entertainers and novelists who "abused" the drug, while "moral people" like office workers were seen as capable of healthy use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

However, two public deaths attributed to drug abuse began to shift attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>:
*   **October 1946:** Comedian Miss Wakana died of a heart attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **January 1947:** Famous novelist Sakonosuke Oda died of a hemorrhage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

While their deaths were likely not directly due to meth overdose (Wakana was clean for two years, Oda likely died from tuberculosis), newspapers seized on their known drug habits and attributed their deaths to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

In October 1950, a mass sexual assault incident near Urawa City, Saitama, involving 100 young people suffering from hallucinations and delusions linked to "Neo-Agotine" (a meth drug by Toyama Chemical), further highlighted the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Toyama Chemical was found to have produced 10 million vials monthly against a quota of 51,000, but was only fined $14 due to the quota being a guideline, not a law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

A pivotal moment was the April 1954 violation and murder of primary school girl Kyoko Hasada in a school bathroom by 20-year-old meth addict Shikichi Sakamaki, who was captured with 500 vials of meth and two needles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. Sakamaki famously said, "Even I myself cannot understand why I committed such a crime. Maybe it was Hitopon that led me to do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. This triggered an avalanche of meth-related headlines, depicting random acts of violence like a woman being stabbed or children being pushed into water and drowning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. By May 1954, half of the 60 reported murders were linked to meth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The media fueled a panic, running drug-related headlines 43 times in the latter half of 1954, characterizing the era as one of "moral decay" or "moral insanity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

## [[public_health_response_and_legal_measures_against_meth | Public Health Response and Legal Measures]]

In 1949, the Japanese government began considering controls on Philopon distribution, spurred by the plight of street orphans who lost parents to meth addiction and committed crimes to fund their own habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The Ministry of Health and Welfare concluded that the root cause was adult dealers and smugglers, not the children themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

In June 1951, Japan passed the **Stimulant Control Act of 1951**, criminalizing the import, manufacture, trafficking, receipt, and possession of these drugs, especially when associated with other crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Police rapidly implemented the law, making 17,528 arrests for stimulant-related offenses in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. However, the law had a maximum sentence of only three years, which shifted meth production from informal labs to organized crime like the Yakuza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

By 1954, the epidemic worsened, with an anonymous census finding 7.5% of respondents aged 15-30 used methamphetamine, 75% of whom injected over five vials a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. The Ministry estimated over half a million abusers in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

In June 1954, Japan amended its Stimulant Control Act, significantly strengthening penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Arrests skyrocketed, with 6,000 arrests related to meth in the four months following the amendment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Police reorganized to target both demand and supply, conducting massive raids such as one in Osaka in July 1954 involving 2,000 officers searching 800 buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Indictments surged from 43% in 1953 to 63%, and over 9,000 violators were jailed between 1951 and 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

### Public Awareness Campaigns

The police invested heavily in public awareness campaigns, spending over 24 million yen on posters, pamphlets, and leaflets to warn against stimulant drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. These materials ranged from optimistic slogans like "Let's Wipe Out the Evil of Stimulant Drugs" to shocking images of syringes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Special focus was placed on young students preparing for examinations, a period of high stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Lectures and discussions were held at schools, factories, workplaces, and nightclubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. By 1955, a survey found that only 3% of youths had never heard of Philopon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

A nationalist narrative emerged, blaming foreign Korean and Taiwanese populations (euphemistically "Third Country residents") and claiming the epidemic was smuggled in by "bad forces abroad," possibly Communists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. In 1954, the Tokyo Police claimed 70% of illegal meth labs were run by Koreans, despite specifically targeting Korean villages for drug raids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. This dubious data exacerbated discrimination and violence against ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

## Decline of the Crisis

Sustained police activity led to a decline in drug crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. By 1957, census cards showed a decline in methamphetamine use, with offenses and arrests decreasing year after year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. By 1962, the "heropon panic" had largely ended, with meth-related arrests declining to about 300-800 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. However, this did not mean addicts stopped using drugs; many switched to sniffing solvents, with related crimes skyrocketing to 20,000 in 1968 and 50,000 in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

The causes for Japan's postwar meth crisis included abundant legal and illegal supply, a lack of awareness about the drug's addictiveness, and terrible economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Changing the first two elements and an alleviation of the third helped reverse the situation and end the heropon panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

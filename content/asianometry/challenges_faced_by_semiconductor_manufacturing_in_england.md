Northeast England, once a center for heavy industry, faced significant economic struggles following the decline of its traditional sectors [00:00:07]. In 1995, Siemens Semiconductor pledged over a billion pounds to build a semiconductor fabrication plant (fab) in North Tyneside, offering hope for a new growth industry [00:00:15]. However, the plant was closed after just 15 months of operation, marking a notable failure for semiconductor manufacturing in the region [00:00:27].

## Economic Landscape of Northeast England

Northeast England is the least populated first-level region within England, with less than 2.7 million residents [00:01:11]. In 2012, its residents had the lowest median gross annual earnings in England and the highest proportion of the population claiming income support [00:01:17]. The area has experienced a significant employment gap with the rest of the UK since at least the 1930s, with a 9.1% unemployment rate in 1995, 50% higher than the rest of the UK [00:01:30].

The region's economic [[challenges_of_working_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenges]] are rooted in historical conditions and a long-standing dependence on heavy industry and coal mining [00:01:44]. After World War II, the British government nationalized the coal and steel industries, with the Ministry of Fuel and Power advocating against introducing new male-employing manufacturing industries to maximize output and employment in these resource-based economies [00:01:53]. This policy left Northeast England overly reliant on two industries [00:02:12].

When de-industrialization began in the 1980s, residents had few alternatives [00:02:15]. Tensions escalated with the Miners' Strike of 1984-1985, where miners fought to prevent mine closures [00:02:22]. The strike's defeat led to thousands of miners losing their jobs as imported coal became cheaper than locally mined coal [00:02:32]. By the 1990s, Northeast England felt marginalized within the global economy and perceived a lack of care from London [00:02:45]. This sentiment was exacerbated by policies like the Barnett formula, which allocated substantially more public spending to Scotland, enabling it to offer more attractive investment packages to multinational companies [00:03:01].

## Siemens' Investment in the UK

Siemens, an established German company founded in 1847, had historically enjoyed a profitable and comfortable position within Germany, supported by the German government for nationalism and employment [00:03:29]. However, the trend of deregulation in the US and UK by the 1980s forced Siemens to become more competitive, leading to a decision to be more international, shareholder-friendly, and market-oriented [00:04:17].

The global semiconductor industry was booming in the mid-1990s, fueled by the release of Windows 95 and the rise of mobile phones [00:04:36]. The industry grew 29% in 1993, 32% in 1994, and 42% in 1995, with a staggering $30 billion invested in new fabs in 1995 [00:04:55]. Siemens Semiconductors, which had traditionally produced chips in-house for other Siemens divisions, began competing for its own customers in the 1990s [00:05:16]. They focused on niche markets like application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for telecommunications, mobile phones, and automobiles [00:05:27]. Sales grew 40% annually in the early 1990s, making Siemens the 12th largest semiconductor maker globally by 1994 [00:05:43].

Despite its European market share, Siemens saw significant opportunity for international growth, with only 1.9% worldwide market share [00:06:02]. In 1994, Siemens Semiconductor planned to triple chip sales and enter the industry's top 10, largely through international expansion [00:06:11]. This included establishing activities outside Germany, such as assembly and packaging plants in Malaysia and Portugal, and strategic alliances [00:06:24]. As part of this, Siemens planned four new large-scale fabrication plants [00:06:40].

In 1995, Siemens approached the Invest in Britain Bureau to discuss building a wafer fabrication facility in the UK [00:06:47]. The proposed fab would be a copy of their successful 16-megabyte DRAM facility in Dresden, costing £1.1 billion (or $785 million USD) and creating 2,000 new jobs [00:06:56]. Siemens considered Ireland, Austria, Israel, Singapore, and Vietnam as other potential locations, with Ireland and Austria being the main competitors [00:07:22].

### Why North Tyneside?

Siemens sought a location with:
*   Skilled, low-cost labor [00:07:34]
*   Excellent water and power infrastructure [00:07:36]
*   Geological stability [00:07:39]
*   Ample government support [00:07:41]

North Tyneside met all these criteria [00:07:44]. The area had skilled technician-level workers willing to work shifts, and Siemens could recruit electronics and computing graduates from local universities or nearby Scotland [00:07:48]. Salaries were 50% lower than in Austria or Germany [00:08:00]. When concerns about electricity infrastructure arose, the government offered a direct connection to the national grid, a first for a private company [00:08:05].

Local development agencies actively courted Siemens officials, offering tours, university presentations, and government support [00:08:16]. UK public support for the project totaled £64 million (or $45 million USD), though not all was used, coming in the form of tax exemptions, grants, and job training subsidies [00:08:34]. While Ireland and Austria offered more transparent and lavish support (Austria offered £120 million) [00:08:52], the investment was deemed worthwhile for the UK [00:09:04].

Attracting a globally renowned company like Siemens was a rare opportunity [00:09:10]. It would further establish the area as a semiconductor destination, building on Fujitsu's 1989 fab in the region [00:09:17]. Adding Siemens could encourage suppliers and other semiconductor companies to set up regional offices, potentially kickstarting an entire industry [00:09:30]. The UK government also saw the opportunity to transfer technology and skills to the local population and reduce semiconductor imports from Europe [00:09:40]. Siemens' commitment to the UK market, where its revenue grew 25% annually from 1985 to 1995, also played a role [00:10:06].

## Construction and Operation

Semiconductor fabs are built in phases to allow for rapid production of wafers [00:10:38]. The North Tyneside fab was planned in two phases:
*   **Phase one:** Completion by mid-1997, producing 16-megabyte DRAM memory units using a 0.35 micron process [00:10:57].
*   **Phase two:** Production of more advanced 64-megabyte memory units using a 0.25 micron process, with capacity upgraded to 20,000 wafer starts per month and meeting the full 2,000 job requirement [00:11:07].

Construction was exceptionally fast, taking just 376 days [00:11:34]. Production began in May 1997, a year and a half after breaking ground [00:11:38]. The Queen visited the facility, proclaiming it brought the country to the forefront of semiconductor manufacturing [00:11:42].

## Failure of the Siemens Fab

In 1997, Siemens delayed phase two of the Tyneside plant [00:12:02]. In July 1998, they announced the plant would close by the end of the year, less than two years after opening [00:12:06].

The North Tyneside fab was always on thin ice due to the immensely volatile DRAM market, which is prone to oversupply [00:12:20]. DRAM chips are cheap commodities that compete on price, are relatively easy to fab, and offer little differentiation from competitors [00:12:32]. Many competitors, particularly from Asia like South Korea which held 40% of the market, contributed to this environment [00:12:43]. Leading-edge technical mastery and market position are critical in this industry [00:12:52].

Siemens' decision to equip the fab with older 16-megabyte memory technology was particularly perilous, as it was already becoming outdated by 1995 [00:12:58]. German plants were already producing 64-megabyte units [00:13:09]. The intention for a cheaper location like North Tyneside was to continue producing these older memory modules profitably and maximize ROI [00:13:14]. Some sources suggested the fab was originally meant for logic chips, but this is unconfirmed [00:13:25]. In hindsight, it would have been more sensible for the Tyneside fab to produce either leading-edge 64-megabyte DRAM or logic chips similar to those from Intel and AMD [00:13:35].

The semiconductor market crashed in 1998, specifically in memory [00:13:48]. The price per megabyte plummeted from $27 to $4 by the time the Tyneside plant opened in 1997, and further to just $2 per megabyte by 1998 [00:13:51]. Chips that sold for $50 in 1995 were selling for just $1 in 1998 [00:14:04]. Semiconductor giants in South Korea, struggling with the Asian financial crisis, continued to produce as many memory wafers as possible to stay afloat, exacerbating the oversupply [00:14:11].

Industry-wide profits collapsed. Siemens Semiconductor, which made a $65 million USD profit in the year ended September 1997, incurred a stunning loss of $722 million USD by 1998 [00:14:20]. Facing significant losses, Siemens Semiconductor needed to cut costs, leading to the closure of the UK plant [00:14:56].

Economically, the North Tyneside fab lacked scale, having only a third of the capacity of Siemens' Dresden plants [00:15:02]. Furthermore, the UK plant lacked significant internal or external backers [00:15:13]. Siemens would not close its German or Austrian plants, and its joint ventures in the US, France, and Taiwan were difficult to exit [00:15:17]. Internally, the pro-British management responsible for establishing the plant, including the CEO, lost their jobs [00:15:27]. The new Siemens Semiconductor CEO, while not anti-Britain, was strongly pro-Germany and implemented drastic cost-cutting measures [00:15:35].

The exit was financially costly, with closing North Tyneside costing nearly a quarter-billion dollars, representing 45% of the division's projected loss that year [00:15:48]. Siemens also had to repay government grants, likely over £15 million [00:16:03]. In August 1999, Siemens Semiconductor was spun off into Infineon Technologies [00:16:10].

## Aftermath and Final Closure

For a few months, rumors of buyers for the facility circulated [00:16:22]. In September 2000, Atmel, a semiconductor firm producing higher-value products like flash NAND memory, radio frequency ICs, and logic products, acquired the facility for £25 million ($35 million USD) [00:16:27]. Atmel announced plans to invest £700 million ($800 million USD) to retool the plant for flash memory and microcontroller circuits, which are more stable markets than DRAM [00:16:54].

However, the dot-com crash of 2001 impacted the electronics industry [00:17:09]. Atmel lost £31 million ($45 million USD) and saw revenues decline by 23%, leading to layoffs and an interruption of its Northeast England investment plans [00:17:14]. While Atmel did not immediately rule out recommitting to the fab, in 2006, they adopted a "fab light" model, leading to the divestment of four fabs, including North Tyneside, in 2007 [00:17:30]. TSMC bought all the semiconductor production equipment, and the empty buildings were sold off, effectively ending the semiconductor dream for the site [00:17:44].

Today, the former fab facility has been transformed into the Cobalt Business Park, housing government offices, call centers, and regional offices [00:17:55]. The closure of the North Tyneside fab was not isolated; 1998 alone saw the loss of 3,400 manufacturing jobs in Northeast England, with factories belonging to Electrolux and Pringle also closing [00:18:04]. The Fujitsu fab, which opened in 1989, also eventually closed [00:18:21].

A persistent [[challenges_of_working_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenge]] for the local economy in Northeast England is its lack of native corporate leaders [00:18:28]. Many factory jobs were provided by foreign companies with little attachment to the region, leading them to favor their homelands when financial crises struck [00:18:31]. While Northeast England has yet to return to its past glory, there are "green shoots" emerging in the renewable energy sector, with companies investing in the region and a growing wind industry, exemplified by projects like the Darker Bank wind farm [00:18:52].

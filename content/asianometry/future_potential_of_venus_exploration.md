Since the 1980s, no country has attempted to land a probe on the surface of Venus, despite the [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Soviet Union's success]] in placing five landers that survived for over 30 minutes each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Space programs have largely shifted their focus to the Moon and Mars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

## Challenges for Future Landers
Venus is considered one of the most challenging places in the Solar System to land on, second only to the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The planet, often dubbed "Earth's evil twin," presents extreme conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>:
*   **Extreme Temperatures** The surface temperature reaches 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius), hotter than Mercury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Immense Pressure** The surface pressure is equivalent to being over 0.5 miles (1 kilometer) underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Corrosive Atmosphere** Venus's thick atmosphere is composed of sulfuric acid clouds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Intense Entry Heating** Atmospheric entry causes friction that can heat probes up to 11,000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

These [[challenges_of_landing_on_venus | challenges]] led to numerous failures for early Venera missions, with probes like Venera 4, 5, and 6 being crushed or succumbing to the heat before reaching the surface or lasting for long periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The [[engineering_design_of_venera_landers | engineering design of Venera landers]] had to be radically rethought to withstand these conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Current Perspectives on Venus Exploration
While no human is ever expected to set foot on Venus alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>, sending another lander to the Venusian surface is entirely possible, as engineers now understand the necessary requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. The Soviets achieved successful landings with "decades-old technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

However, the primary barrier to future lander missions is economics and cost-benefit analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Investing significant resources into a probe that survives for less than a day is deemed "insane" from a cost-benefit perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

### Alternative Exploration Methods
Due to these limitations, most recent Venus exploration proposals have focused on alternatives to traditional landers, such as:
*   **Balloons** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>
*   **High-altitude floating explorations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>

### Advancements for Long-Duration Landers
For a lander mission to be economically viable in the future, it would need to be capable of:
*   **Mobility** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>
*   **Extended Survival** Lasting for weeks on the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>

Achieving this requires advanced cooling technologies, which are currently "a few years away" from being fully developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Despite the loss of some "secret work" from the Soviet era regarding the Venera series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, ongoing developments in "extreme environment technologies" offer promise for making a return trip to Venus's surface feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

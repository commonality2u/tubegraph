The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries — Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman — are among the most water-stressed nations globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The region has historically suffered from water scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Over 65% of the world's desalination water capacity is located in the Gulf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Water Scarcity in the Gulf

Kuwait, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar possess less than 100 cubic meters of renewable freshwater per person, significantly below the average household use of 136 cubic meters per year for a family of four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Surface water sources are often undrinkable; for example, Saudi Arabia's largest surface lake, Al-Asfar, is largely fed by agricultural runoff and is contaminated with heavy metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Groundwater exploitation in GCC countries is intense, with only about 10% of extracted groundwater being recharged, leading to negative social consequences like land subsidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Adding to the challenge, the populations in these countries are rapidly increasing, more than doubling from 26.2 million in 1995 to 56.4 million in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. The GCC is also one of the most urbanized regions, with 85% of the population residing in urban areas, a figure expected to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

Water demand is further driven by agriculture, with the farming of cereals, vegetables, fruits, and fodder consuming up to 85% of the GCC countries' water resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. National security-linked self-sufficiency food requirements make it difficult to reduce this demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Given these extensive water challenges, GCC countries view desalination as the most effective means to secure a sufficient supply of renewable freshwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Desalination in the Gulf

Jeddah, a densely packed Saudi Arabian city and gateway to Mecca, receives less than 10 centimeters of rain annually but borders the Red Sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. With a booming population, Jeddah acquired its first desalination machine, the "Kendassa" (condenser), from the United Kingdom in 1907 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This machine, which evaporated and re-condensed seawater, served the area for nearly two decades before being replaced in 1928 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

The 1920s saw the emergence of many land-based industrial desalination plants, including a significant one in Curacao <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This global surge in capacity was initially driven by the booming oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, with World War II further advancing the technology, primarily led by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Post-war, Middle Eastern nations, including the GCC, were early adopters of this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. In 1957, Kuwait installed the first modern-style distillation plant by Westinghouse, capable of producing approximately 3,800 cubic meters of fresh water per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. In 1966, Saudi Arabia established a Water Desalination office, later renamed the Saline Water Conversion Corporation (SWCC), and now the Saudi Water Authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This entity is singularly responsible for 22% of the world's desalination capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

From the late 1970s, desalinated water capacity in the Middle East and North Africa, including the GCC, grew rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Today, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates produce the majority of desalinated water among GCC countries, with Saudi Arabia producing 2.9 million cubic meters and the UAE 2.2 million in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The UAE's Jebel Ali Power and Desalination Complex alone recently expanded to 2.2 million cubic meters of total desalted water capacity per day, equivalent to over 880 Olympic-sized swimming pools daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Saudi Arabia's Ras Al Khair desalination complex, a power and water cogeneration plant built for over $7 billion, can produce 1 million cubic meters of freshwater each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | Desalination Technologies]]

There are two primary categories of desalination: thermal and membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### [[desalination_technologies_msf_and_reverse_osmosis | Thermal Multi-Stage Flash (MSF)]]

Virtually all of the mega-sized water facilities in the Gulf operate using thermal-based methods, with Multi-Stage Flash (MSF) being the dominant technology since its emergence in the 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

MSF operates on the principle that the boiling point of water depends on both temperature and surrounding pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Unlike older methods that raised temperature by running hot steam through submerged pipes (which led to "salt scaling" or "scale deposits" that hurt efficiency and required lengthy cleaning processes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, MSF lowers pressure to induce flashing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

An MSF plant consists of many modular stages, each with a low-pressure flash chamber and a condenser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Heated seawater enters the flash chamber, where low pressure causes a portion to instantly flash into steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The steam is de-misted to remove pure water vapor, and the now-saltier brine moves to the next stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The pure water vapor is condensed into freshwater by condenser tubes filled with brine or incoming seawater, recovering heat and improving efficiency by 30-35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. More stages increase efficiency, with the biggest plants having up to 40 stages and evaporating 85% of intake water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

To prevent salt scaling, operators maintain a top brine temperature of 90-120 degrees Celsius, pre-treat seawater with de-carbonation, add scale inhibitor chemicals like phosphates, and perform limited washing using sponge balls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

#### MSF Advantages and Disadvantages

MSF is widely used in the GCC due to its simplicity and ability to process vast amounts of seawater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. It has few moving parts (besides pumps) and connecting pipes, minimizing leaks and corrosion, making it robust and reliable, often outlasting its 20-year design lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Its modular stages allow for easy capacity adjustment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Additionally, extensive pre-treatment is not essential, as MSF can handle poor quality seawater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

The main drawback of MSF is its massive [[Energy Sources for Desalination | energy consumption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Estimates range from 10 to 25 kilowatt hours or higher per cubic meter of desalted water, primarily heat energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. While pairing plants with existing power stations to use byproduct heat can cut energy consumption by about 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, the energy requirements remain daunting. In 2014, Saudi Arabia's cogeneration plants consumed 1.5 million barrels of oil daily, or 15% of its oil production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Without the GCC countries' large energy reserves and generous subsidies, these massive MSF plants would likely not be economical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### [[desalination_technologies_msf_and_reverse_osmosis | Reverse Osmosis (RO)]]

Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) is the dominant membrane-based [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | desalination method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. It works by using pressure to push salty water through a semi-permeable filter, trapping the salt and yielding clean water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

SWRO is significantly less [[Energy Sources for Desalination | energy-intensive]] than MSF, requiring about 4 to 5 kilowatt hours per cubic meter of water, which is a third or quarter of MSF's requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. As energy is the most significant [[Economic Considerations of Desalination | cost factor]] for desalination, countries outside the GCC have largely opted for RO processes since 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Although MSF plants are the world's largest, RO holds over 60% of the world's installed desalination capacity due to its lower [[Energy Sources for Desalination | energy requirements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

Additional advantages of SWRO include its compatibility with cheap [[Energy Sources for Desalination | renewable energy sources]] like solar and a smaller economical system size, encouraging localized water sources and reducing the need for expensive pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

A major downside for large-scale RO operations is the necessity for extensive pre-treatment of seawater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Silt, algae, jellyfish, salts, and decomposed organic matter (Humics) can foul membranes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Pre-treatment, which includes screens, sand filters, and chemical additions like chlorine or anti-coagulants, can add up to 25% to the final cost of desalted water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

#### RO in the GCC

Among GCC countries, Bahrain has the highest usage rate of RO due to its more brackish source water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Saudi Arabia built its first RO plant in Jeddah in 1978, primarily as a demonstration unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. While MSF methods will continue to dominate the region due to significant existing investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, increasing [[Economic Considerations of Desalination | cost]] and [[Environmental and economic impacts of desalination | environmental pressures]] are leading GCC countries to explore more RO-only and hybrid RO-thermal systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. In 2022, the Saudi Water and Electricity Company commissioned Shuqaiq 3 on the Red Sea, one of its first large RO plants with a capacity of 450,000 cubic meters per day, costing $600 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Saudi Arabia's recent privatization moves in its freshwater supply industry are expected to further these [[trends_in_desalination_and_energy_consumption | trends towards more sustainable desalination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

## Brine Disposal: An [[Environmental and economic impacts of desalination | Environmental and Economic Challenge]]

A significant [[Environmental and economic impacts of desalination | environmental concern]] common to both thermal and membrane desalination processes is brine disposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. For every two cubic meters of freshwater produced, one cubic meter of brine is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. For instance, 2.2 million cubic meters of freshwater production necessitates disposing of 1.1 million cubic meters of brine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

The remaining brine is typically hot and 40% to 80% saltier than seawater, often containing heavy metals, acids, chlorine, and anti-scalant chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Brine disposal is challenging and represents one of the most significant [[Economic Considerations of Desalination | cost factors]] in desalination, potentially adding 5-30% to the final cost of freshwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

Options for brine disposal are limited. Burying it underground can foul groundwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Dumping it at the shoreline or deep underwater, even with substantial dilution, harms the local ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Extracting and selling salt from brine is not yet economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. These [[Environmental and economic impacts of desalination | environmental issues]] are inherent to both SWRO and MSF methods and are expected to worsen as the GCC countries' water demands grow and more desalination mega-facilities are constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Conclusion and [[Challenges and future directions in desalination | Future Directions]]

While the vast MSF desalination plants in the Middle East are impressive, their current form is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Abolishing desalination is impractical, as these countries consume 8 to 30 times more freshwater than they naturally possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Desalination is a necessity.

However, there is an urgent need to break down the intense centralization of GCC countries' water systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. For example, 50% of Saudi Arabia's desalination capacity is concentrated in just five plants, and 60% of the UAE's capacity in four plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. This centralization is uneconomical, [[Environmental and economic impacts of desalination | environmentally dangerous]], and poses a national security threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. A [[trends_in_desalination_and_energy_consumption | technology transition]] away from MSF towards SWRO can encourage decentralization, bringing water supplies closer to consumers, which is beneficial for communities, nations, and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL) recently unveiled their first generation [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] for commercial use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While scientists initially developed [[development_history_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] alongside [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]], lithium gained dominance, causing sodium to fall by the wayside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. However, [[development_history_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] are now seeing renewed interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Battery Structure and Advantages

[[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | Sodium-ion batteries]] share a similar structure with [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]], featuring a cathode, an anode, a porous separator, and an electrolyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. During use, ions migrate between the cathode and anode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The main distinction lies in their components being made of different compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. A key advantage is that [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | commercial sodium-ion batteries]] can leverage the same engineering and production methods as [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The most significant advantage of [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] over [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] is the availability of raw materials and the associated [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | cost]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. While most of the world's lithium comes from Australia, Chile, China, and Argentina, and its extraction is not environmentally friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, the global supply of sodium is virtually unlimited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The Earth's crust contains over 1,000 times more sodium than lithium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This translates to a raw ingredient [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | cost]] of $150 per ton for sodium, compared to $5,000 for lithium, a 30-times decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Another factor for renewed interest in [[development_history_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion battery]] technologies is the extensive number of [[the_influence_of_patents_on_lfp_battery_development | patents]] filed around [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion technologies]], which makes it difficult for new companies to operate without infringing on existing intellectual property rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. [[development_history_of_sodiumion_batteries | Sodium-ion battery]] technologies, by contrast, offer a far larger "green field" for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## CATL's First Generation Details

CATL's first generation [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion battery]] incorporates several key [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development | technologies]]:
*   **Anode** The anode is made of hard carbon, a common choice in [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development | sodium-ion battery development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. CATL states that their hard carbon anode features a unique porous structure, which extends its cycle lifetime and facilitates greater sodium ion movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Cathode** For the cathode, CATL utilizes a substance called Prussian white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Prussian white is an analog of the pigment Prussian blue, first synthesized over 300 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. It is cheap, easily made, non-toxic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, and was identified in the early 2010s as suitable for [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development | sodium-ion battery]] cathodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Prussian white cathodes exhibit good discharge rates and can maintain capacity over many charge cycles, with some tests showing 95% retention even after 10,000 cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. A drawback, however, is their significant capacity loss in the presence of moisture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **Energy Density** CATL's first generation [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion battery]] can achieve energy densities of up to 160 watt-hours per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This is comparable to current [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | lithium-ion phosphate batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. CATL aims for over 200 watt-hours per kilogram in their second generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. It is important to note that sodium has a lower ionization potential than lithium, meaning [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] will generally have lower energy densities and operating voltages than their lithium counterparts, and it is unclear if they can ever fully catch up to top-line [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Commercial Strategy and Market Impact

Given the similarities in engineering and manufacturing processes between sodium and [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]], CATL plans to tightly integrate its [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion offering]] into its existing [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion]] infrastructure and product ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

While the manufacturing overlap means [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | sodium-ion battery costs]] won't be drastically lower than [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]], most savings will come from cheaper raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. One estimate suggests end-users could see 10% to 30% [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | price savings]] with [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

CATL also highlighted battery system integration capabilities, allowing the mixing of sodium and [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] into a single system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. In such systems, [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]], which currently offer higher energy densities, would be automatically utilized when [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion]] falls short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

## Potential [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage | Applications]]

[[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | Sodium-ion batteries]] are unlikely to replace [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] in devices like mobile phones due to their lower energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. However, they show significant potential in:
*   Short-range [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage | electric vehicles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>
*   [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage | Stationary power systems]], where space is less of a constraint, thus mitigating the impact of lower energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
    *   This includes [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage | energy storage]] for large-scale solar and wind renewables, where [[price_trends_and_factors_affecting_battery_costs | cost savings]] are highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

As the world's largest battery company, CATL is expected to invest substantial resources, leveraging its size, manufacturing prowess, and R&D expertise to advance [[commercialization_and_potential_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion technology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

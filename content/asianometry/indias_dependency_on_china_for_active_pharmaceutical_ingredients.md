Despite the [[global_export_strategy_of_indian_generic_drugs | export success]] of the [[growth_of_indias_pharmaceutical_industry | Indian pharmaceutical industry]], a significant concern is its concurrent reliance on China for active ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are the most crucial raw materials for manufacturing finished drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. For example, acetaminophen is the active ingredient in Tylenol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

## Current Dependency
India currently depends on China for 70% of its active pharmaceutical ingredient imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Imports of Chinese APIs, especially antibiotics, have tripled since 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

## Historical Context
India previously produced these ingredients domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. However, it lost this market in the 1990s when Chinese products entered at prices 40% cheaper than what Indian manufacturers could offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Even today, despite higher Chinese labor costs, a price gap of about 20% remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

## Recent Challenges
This industrial vulnerability became particularly evident in 2020 when China implemented lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Chinese vendors experienced stock shortages and restricted the export of certain ingredients essential for making virus medicines to India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Additionally, ongoing geopolitical tensions between China and India pose a real risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

## Path Forward
The [[growth_of_indias_pharmaceutical_industry | Indian pharmaceutical industry]] is encouraged to collaborate with the government to address these shortcomings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. This involves implementing new import substitution policies for these active ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

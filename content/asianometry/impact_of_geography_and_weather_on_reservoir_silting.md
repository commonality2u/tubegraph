Reservoir silting, or sedimentation, is a significant issue that reduces a dam's capacity to store drinking water, generate power, and provide flood protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This problem affects reservoirs globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The extent and rate of reservoir silting are heavily influenced by local geography and weather patterns.

## Understanding Sediment Yield

Rivers naturally carry two types of sediment: coarse sediment (sands and gravels from the riverbed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> and fine-grained sediment (smaller particles, around two millimeters wide, from the riverbed, clay, or silt washed down by rain or human activity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The total amount of sediment carried by rivers is measured as "sediment yield," expressed in units like tons per year per square kilometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

When a river is dammed, its natural sediment transport flow is interrupted, causing sediments to settle within the reservoir, eventually filling it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The storage capacity lost due to this accumulation is known as "dead storage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Geographical and Weather Influences on Silting

While all reservoirs are eventually affected by silting, some regions experience a more pronounced impact due to specific geographical and weather conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Taiwan's Mountainous Terrain and Typhoons

Taiwan's reservoirs are particularly susceptible to silting due to its geography and weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Geography**: The island is heavily mountainous with many loose soils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Weather**: Taiwan experiences frequent typhoon storms with prolonged rainstorms that can last for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. These heavy rains sweep loose soils into rivers, significantly increasing sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

For example, Typhoon Morakot in 2009, which dropped 277 millimeters of rain across the island, deposited an estimated 90 million cubic meters of sediment into Taiwan's largest reservoir, the Zengwen Reservoir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This massive sediment load, combined with torrential rain, raised concerns about the reservoir spilling over and causing downstream damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Australia's Flood and Drought Cycles

Australia's economy relies heavily on surface irrigation from dams and reservoirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Until the 1970s, engineers underestimated the rates of reservoir sedimentation, assuming low sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This proved incorrect, as over 20 dams in Australia became fully silted between 1890 and 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

The highest rates of siltation in Australia occurred during large floods that followed significant droughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Dams were often ill-equipped to manage the massive influx of muddy floodwaters under these conditions, leading to [[consequences_of_reservoir_silting | significant consequences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Despite the challenges posed by geography and weather, land conservation methods and new farming techniques introduced after the 1950s led to declining siltation rates in Australia due to lower river sediment yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

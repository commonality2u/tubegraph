Undersea cables are the unheralded backbones of the global communications network, carrying gigabits of information and supporting a hyper-connected, ultra-high-tech world [00:00:02]. Despite their critical role, these seemingly low-tech cables navigate a dangerous environment [00:00:10].

## Human-Related Hazards
Humans are responsible for a significant portion of cable breaks, particularly in shallower waters.

### Fishermen and Shipping
Two-thirds of all cable breaks in depths under 200 meters are caused by human activities, specifically ship anchors and fishermen's nets [00:09:40].

*   **Anchors**: When a boat drops or retrieves an anchor, it drags along the seabed. If the anchor hits and slides along a cable, it can cut its external armor and internal core [00:09:47].
*   **Nets**:
    *   **Otter-trawl nets**: These are large, cone-shaped nets towed by boats to catch bottom fish [00:10:02]. They use 1-ton hardwood boards, reinforced with steel, called "otterboards" to keep the net's mouth open [00:10:08]. These boards can snag and damage unburied cables [00:10:14].
    *   **Beam trawls**: A cone-shaped net with a bag at the end, typically 10 meters wide and weighing 4-5 tons [00:10:21]. It has sliders or shoes on the bottom that scrape the ocean floor [00:10:31]. If a cable is exposed, the shoe can cut it [00:10:37]. In 2009, beam trawls were modified with a wing gear that floats over the seabed, but this still sliced cable insulation, exposing it to the elements, even if it didn't cut the cable entirely [00:10:43].

The 1884 Cable Convention, the most widely known international law on cables, stipulates that if a fisherman's anchors or nets get caught in a cable, they must sacrifice the equipment and report the incident to the cable owner [00:10:56]. In return, fishermen are entitled to indemnity for their sacrificed equipment, though the claim process is not entirely clear [00:11:11].

### Sabotage
While most cable breaks are accidental, intentional cable cuts do occur [00:11:43].

*   **Theft**: Many incidents are thefts for financial gain [00:11:51]. A notable event in March 2007 involved two vessels, one from Vietnam, removing 79 and 98 kilometers of cable from two Southeast Asian networks to sell the copper, damaging Vietnam's internet for three months [00:11:56]. Similar incidents have occurred in Jamaica, Indonesia, and Egypt [00:12:10].
    *   Cables within a country's exclusive economic zone (200 miles from shore) are relatively safe, but outside this zone, laws become murkier, and perpetrators may face low fines or no punishment [00:12:14].
*   **Asymmetrical Warfare**: Cable cuts are a critical focus of war planning because they can interrupt communications for extended periods [00:12:28].
    *   During World War I, British control of the subsea cable network cut off the Central Powers from their overseas possessions [00:12:41].
    *   In World War II, this forced Axis powers to communicate via encrypted radio, which opened the door to interception and decryption [00:12:48].
    *   More recently, reports of cable cuts in the Red Sea have affected internet speed [00:12:57].
    *   Cutting a subsea cable can be as simple as dropping an anchor and dragging it across the sea floor [00:13:04]. Given the high cost of repair, such an attack is effective in asymmetrical warfare, being easy to execute and easy to deny deliberate intent [00:13:14].

## Protection Against Human-Related Threats
[[challenges_in_laying_and_protecting_undersea_cables | Protecting undersea cables]] from human threats is a significant challenge.

### Burying Cables
The most effective way to protect a cable is to dig a deep trench, lay the cable inside, and cover it [00:13:22].
*   This process is challenging underwater as traditional excavation equipment cannot be used [00:13:27].
*   Modern methods involve high-pressure water jets or sophisticated underwater trenching machines [00:13:32].
*   The depth of burial depends on seabed conditions [00:13:44]. The general rule of thumb is no more than 2 meters deep, but softer seabeds require deeper burial to withstand anchor damage [00:13:47].
*   In the late 1990s, a "Burial Protection Index" was developed by fiber optic operators to determine burial depth for thousands of miles of cable, but it is now considered outdated, with risk assessment left to the integrator [00:13:57].

### Alternative Protections
If the ground is too hard to cut through, alternatives exist:
*   **Riprap (Rock Armor)**: This method, often used to protect beaches from erosion, involves laying smaller rocks on top of the cable, followed by larger rocks [00:14:20]. Riprap works best in calm water currents to prevent the rocks from being disturbed [00:14:32].
*   **Cover Plates or Casing Pipes**: These are shells that encase the cable [00:14:38]. Additional protections like riprap can be layered on top if necessary [00:14:44].

### Overall Protection Strategy
While the engineering for protecting cables from [[natural_and_environmental_hazards_to_undersea_cables | natural hazards]] is robust, a determined attacker can still easily cut a cable [00:15:04]. Consequently, reliance is often placed on security through obscuration, depth, and the physical protections offered by trenches, riprap, and other methods [00:15:15].

Despite the growth of satellite services like SpaceX's StarLink, undersea cables continue to carry the majority of the world's internet and telephone traffic, making their protection critical [00:15:28].

In March 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake caused a massive tsunami that disabled the cooling systems of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Without proper cooling, the plant's nuclear fuel melted down, resulting in several hydrogen explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The plant's owner, TEPCO, and the Japanese government have since committed billions of dollars to the site's safe and efficient decommissioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. To minimize human safety risk, TEPCO has developed and deployed a series of advanced radiation-hardened robots to perform critical tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Accident

The Fukushima Daiichi plant has six units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Units Four, Five, and Six:** These units were not operating when the accident occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Units five and six, separated from units one through four, suffered minor damage from the tsunami but largely survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Unit four was damaged by the tsunami and experienced a hydrogen explosion due to exhaust spillover from the neighboring unit three <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. However, because its reactor was shut down, the fuel rods suffered little damage, leading to a tolerable radiation dosage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Units One, Two, and Three:** These units suffered the worst damage, as they were in operation when the tsunami hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. All three reactors experienced meltdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Units one and three also had hydrogen explosions that released radioactive materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Robots in Nuclear Disaster Response: A Historical Context

### Three Mile Island (1979)
The first nuclear response robots were developed by the United States after the accident at Three Mile Island in 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Two robots were used for site inspection in high-radiation areas inaccessible to people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>:
*   **Surveillance and In-Service Inspection Robot:** First deployed in August 1982, three years after the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. It was a crawler that took photographs, collected samples, and made radiation readings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Fred:** Introduced the year after the first robot, Fred was equipped with a high-pressure water spray for decontamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
To de-fuel the Three Mile Island reactor core, which was flooded with radioactive water, three remote reconnaissance vehicles were built and deployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. These practical, tethered robots were small, built with familiar technologies, and successfully flushed, scraped, and cleaned walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Chernobyl (1986)
After Chernobyl, the Soviet Union initially relied on hundreds of thousands of human "liquidators" (biorobots) to clean up rubble and debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This was partly because radiation levels were so high that available robots failed, and partly due to bureaucratic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Eventually, robots were brought in, notably the Specialized Transport Robot (STR-1), a wirelessly controlled bulldozer adapted from an unmanned lunar vehicle for removing debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Early [[development_and_deployment_of_fukushima_robots | Robot Deployment at Fukushima]]

The first robot arrived at Fukushima in April 2011, three weeks after the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### American Robots
Four military multipurpose robots from the Pakbot series, made by American company iRobot Corporation, were brought in to enter the damaged and irradiated Unit 1, 2, and 3 reactor buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Pakbot, first used in 2000 for detecting and diffusing improvised explosive devices in Iraq and Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, is small and lightweight (around 30 kilograms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. After brief training, they entered Unit 2, measured radiation dosage, atmospheric temperatures, and oxygen concentrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

A larger iRobot, nicknamed Warrior, was later brought in for additional cleaning work throughout the second half of 2011, vacuuming and clearing obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Other cleaner robots included Bobcat and the Swedish-built Brokk 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
The T-Hawk, a small unmanned aerial vehicle from Honeywell, flew over Units 1 through 4 from April 10th to July 24th to review the situation and collect dust samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The use of American robots sparked mild controversy regarding Japan's own robotics technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Japanese Robot Initial Response
After a criticality accident in September 1999, three Japanese technology centers developed nuclear disaster robots, including the Remote Surveillance Squad (Rescue robots) built by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. However, these robots received few upgrades after their completion in 2001, reportedly due to a lack of budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Consequently, when the Fukushima disaster occurred ten years later, they were not ready; many critical components were out of stock, and there were no trained operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

Over several months, JAEA re-engineered the Rescue robot into the JAEA-3, grafting parts from Brokk robots on site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. It finally started its missions in September 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

TEPCO also turned to a series of search and rescue robots developed by the Neito Project at the Chiba Institute of Technology, named Kinsei <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Kinsei, a robot with continuous tracks, was developed to be waterproof and highly mobile across difficult terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. TEPCO requested modifications, primarily to harden the robots against radioactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. In June 2011, the modified Kinsei entered the reactor buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. In October 2011, after five successful missions, a broken communications link forced the team to abandon a Kinsei robot on the third floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Kinsei 2 and 3 were redesigned to fix this flaw and deployed in February 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Radiation Hardening for Robots

Nuclear accidents release various forms of radiation, including alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, x-rays, and neutron particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. When radiation particles interact with semiconductor material, two main effects can occur:
*   **Displacement Effect:** Particles like neutrons and alpha particles collide with semiconductors, displacing atoms and shifting their structural arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This alters the device's properties, leading to higher current leakage or decreased lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Ionization Effect:** Electrons, protons, and x-rays pass through semiconductors, creating electron-hole pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This can cause permanent glitches and erratic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

These effects can disable a system instantly or accumulate over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Damage occurs at device, circuit, and system levels, so radiation hardening must be performed at all these levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Device Level:** Modifying transistor layouts, adding insulating substrates (e.g., silicon on insulator), or making devices larger (e.g., bigger gate sizes for higher current capacities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Circuit Level:** Duplicating critical circuits or adding monitoring circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. These protections are generally hardware-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **System Level:** Introducing software benefits, such as preventive scrubbing algorithms to correct errors, in addition to physical radiation armor and redundancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Kinsei, made from conventional electronics, required testing for radiation resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Subsequent gamma ray testing of its components (including 180-nanometer CPU, motherboard, and motor driver boards) found that its essential components could survive a dose of about 200 grays (20,000 rads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Initial measurements during the disaster response were around 100 grays, leading the team to conclude Kinsei could operate for over 100 hours with a 10% chance of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

## Decommissioning and Cleanup Efforts

After the immediate emergency, the Japanese government's goals are to gradually decommission the plant and rebuild the surrounding area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This multi-step process is overseen by both TEPCO and the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning (IRID) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Rubble Removal
The hydrogen explosions scattered rubble across the site, which needs to be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Astaco Sora:** Developed by Hitachi, this heavy-duty robot uses two arms to put rubble into a recycling bin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Raccoon and Arounder:** Smaller cleaner bots that spray down the ground around Reactor Unit 2 or other areas with high-pressure water jets or dry ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Meister:** A heavy-duty robot capable of drilling for samples or vacuuming up particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

### [[nuclear_fuel_removal_and_cleanup_at_fukushima | Spent Fuel Removal]]
Each unit has a spent fuel assembly for storing fuel no longer useful for energy generation, which must be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Unit 4:** In December 2014, TEPCO announced the successful removal of 1,535 spent fuel rods from the damaged Unit 4 reactor pool, which were then placed in a cooling pool in Unit 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Unit 3:** In 2019, TEPCO began removing 566 spent fuel rods from Unit 3, completing the process in February 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Units 1 and 2:** Removal of spent fuel rods from these units is scheduled to begin in 2023 or beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### [[nuclear_fuel_removal_and_cleanup_at_fukushima | Nuclear Fuel Debris (Corium) Inspection and Removal]]
In Units 1 through 3, the fuel melted down, burning through its original location in the reactor pressure vessel (RPV) and the concrete pedestal it sits on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. It eventually reached the primary containment vessel (PCV) before emergency efforts cooled it with water, causing it to resolidify into nuclear fuel debris, officially named corium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This corium must be inspected and eventually removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Due to the unique circumstances of each reactor, IRID uses different robots for investigation.

#### Unit 1 Inspection
Unit 1's nuclear reactor PCV is flooded to a depth of 2 meters, likely containing corium at its bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
*   In 2012, TEPCO punched a small hole into the PCV to run a wired camera and conduct water tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   In 2014, IRID developed a "morphing robot" (P-Morph) designed to squeeze through a 100-millimeter hole and then transform into a U-shape to travel around a lead plate used for radiation shielding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The first P-Morph encountered an unexpected obstacle and had to be abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>, but improvements led to mission completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. The next step is to build a robot to collect the pebble-like nuclear fuel debris scattered inside the pedestal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

#### Unit 2 Inspection
Unit 2 suffered a meltdown but no hydrogen explosion, leaving its building structure largely intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   TEPCO produced a "scorpion-like" robot called Scorpion, which could crawl through a small hole and reconfigure itself for better mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Deployed in 2017 after significant clearing work, Scorpion's left tread failed for unknown reasons, and it was left inside the reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   The team eventually photographed the entire inside of the reactor using a camera on what looked like a fishing rod, stitching multiple shots into a panorama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

#### Unit 3 Inspection
The corium inside Unit 3 was the last to be photographed because the PCV is almost entirely flooded to a depth of about 6 meters, necessitating new approaches and equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. The entrance approach used for Unit 2 was not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, and the best way in was only 14 centimeters across <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   It took two years to build a suitable robot for this task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This tiny robot, just 13 centimeters across and 30 centimeters long, was nicknamed the "Mini Manbo" (little sunfish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   In 2017, the Mini Manbo successfully recorded video of the nuclear debris, making international news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

#### Future Plans for Removal
Now that the relevant pieces of nuclear fuel debris have been found, work can begin on their removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. IRID and TEPCO have decided to start collecting and removing nuclear fuel debris from Unit 2 first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. A massive stainless steel robotic arm, sitting outside the PCV, will reach through a hole to pick up the debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. As of this writing, the project start will be delayed into 2023 due to the need to improve the arm's capabilities and add several attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. IRID expects it will take at least 10 years to remove all nuclear fuel debris from the Fukushima site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, with more years needed for cleaning and decontamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

## Progress and Future Outlook

Despite the ongoing challenges, conditions have improved to the point that the Japanese government has allowed local residents to return to their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. In April 2019, the government lifted the evacuation order for Kuma, the town closest to the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. However, only a small percentage of the town's residents have returned, indicating that significant work remains for both people and robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

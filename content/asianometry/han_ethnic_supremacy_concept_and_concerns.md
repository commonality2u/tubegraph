From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Han ethnic supremacy is an emerging point of concern on China's internet and in cultural discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While some might dismiss these views as fringe, they are expressions of real people and should not be overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Defining "Han"

The definition of "Han" is a complex question, similar to defining "white" in America, which has changed over time to include groups like Italians and Irish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Han ethnicity is subject to the times and whims of the current era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It refers not to a distinct nationality, ethnicity, or race, but to a constructed bundle of different items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. There is no single criterion that unconditionally qualifies someone as Han; it's often a "I know it when I see it" situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The existence of ethnic groups like the Hakka and Cantonese serves as proof of this nuanced reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Han Supremacist Ideology

Han supremacists disregard this nuance, viewing "Han-ness" as a single, mono-race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. According to one such site's constitution, "Han people are the core race in China," and "the interests of the Han race are one and one with those of China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. They describe the Han as having "five thousand years of direct racial inheritance" and their blood as "one of the purest in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Historical Counterarguments

Genetically, Han people are a deeply intermixed group, having migrated and mixed for generations across China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. China has been ruled longer by foreigners than by Han people over the past 1,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

[[historical_context_of_han_supremacy_in_china | Han nationalism]] did play a role in toppling the Qing Dynasty and establishing both the Republic of China (ROC) and the People's Republic of China (PRC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Centuries of ethnic minority Manchu rule grated against the Han majority, leading elites to rail against the "furry and horned" Manchu people and attempt to unite the "pure Han race" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

However, when the ROC came to power, Sun Yat-sen recognized that continued feelings of Han supremacy would divide the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Observing the splitting of other World War I-era empires like Russia and Austria-Hungary, Sun wanted China to avoid a similar fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. He and other Kuomintang founders promoted racial harmony as a core tenet, symbolized by the five-colored flag and the principle of "Five Races Under One Union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Despite this, Han ethnocentrism remained a lingering issue for governance and the suppression of ethnic minorities, posing a major social problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) drew support from China's ethnic minorities who were disillusioned with the ROC, making them a critical constituency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Mao Zedong personally held strong views on the value of China's ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. In an April 1956 speech, he stated that "all through the ages the reactionary rulers chiefly from the Han nationality sowed feelings of estrangement among our various nationalities and bullied the minority peoples" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. He emphasized the need for extensive and sustained efforts to educate cadres and the masses on the proletarian nationality policy and to frequently review relationships between Han and minority nationalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## [[government_policies_and_ethnic_minority_dynamics_in_china | Government Policies and Ethnic Minority Dynamics in China]]

The PRC pays significant attention to ethnic minority and racial harmony issues for both ideological and practical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. While not known for gender equality, the CCP has done an admirable job of promoting high-performing cadres from ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

The CCP itself helped create and codify China's ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. In the 1950s, teams were sent to locate, classify, and protect non-Han ethnic cultures, resulting in the creation of 56 separate nationalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The People's Congress then crafted affirmative action policies and preferential treatment to help China's minorities achieve an even level with the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

These benefits include:
*   Regional ethnic autonomous states within China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   Dedicated museums, parks, schools, and events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   Preferential treatment in China's national testing exam (Gaokao), where minorities in western China, for example, might need 200 points compared to 500 for Han people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   An exception to the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

Some of these policies are also reflected in Taiwan, where recognized aboriginal tribes receive similar benefits in their college exams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. These affirmative action policies were introduced due to significant existing gaps between ethnic minorities and the Han, similar to income, wealth, and employment gaps between white and black Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Han Resentment and [[han_cultural_movements_and_their_implications | Han Cultural Movements]]

Despite the policies, generational gaps persist, and the policies have largely succeeded in cultivating resentment from the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Han people perceive themselves as the crucial driver of the Chinese nation and its history, yet feel they are not treated equally to ethnic minorities and are seen as part of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

Such views have found strong adherence in dark corners of the Chinese internet, with dozens of Han culture forums and websites emerging in China, Taiwan, and the overseas Chinese diaspora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. A famous example was "Han Net," now closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

These movements advocate for the revitalization of certain aspects of Han Chinese culture while rejecting others for their non-Han origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. For example, they cringe at the idea of China encouraging Qing-era clothing like the Manchu *chi pao* or *makwa* (horse jacket) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Instead, they advocate for *hanfu* clothing, worn before what they call "alien rule" by the Manchu conquest of the Ming Dynasty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The *hanfu* movement went mainstream because the clothes were perceived as "cute," and for many, it remained just "nice cosplay" or a way to connect with culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. However, the *hanfu* movement and other Han culture sites eventually served as a "gateway drug" for harder versions of Han supremacism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Historical Revisionism

Han ethnocentrists hold a special dislike for the Manchu people, vigorously fighting to revise views of the Qing and Yuan dynasties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. They paint the Qing Dynasty and its Manchu leaders as bloodthirsty, claiming they rolled back Ming Dynasty advancements, stole Han wealth, butchered them, and made China a backward country, thus allowing the West to advance and invade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. They view the Manchu as colonists, "same as the British in India" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. They cite historical records of deaths related to the Qing conquest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

<div class="callout is-info">
The Qing conquest was a long, complicated series of wars often involving Han battling Han <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. To simplify it to "bad Manchu victimizing innocent Han" is to hijack history for their own purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This historical revisionism, which often defies logic, aims to reject 300 years of China's history and pin its decline on a foreign race, absolving Han blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Specific Grievances with Affirmative Action

The CCP's affirmative action policies receive legitimate criticism online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Han netizens view it as a "quiet deal" where ethnic minorities receive special privileges in exchange for not seeking independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The two most aggravating policies are the national examination benefits and the exemption from the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

The one-child policy exemption has seen the proportion of ethnic minorities in China rise from 3% in 1949 to 8% today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. To Han supremacists, this means the Han people are "the only country in the world with the people conducting their own self-destruction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Coupled with easier national exam thresholds, this creates a perception that "there are more ethnic minorities running around and they are dumber" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

Incidents of ethnic violence also fuel Han supremacist sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. For example, the late 2000s riots in Urumqi triggered a massive upsurge in anti-minority sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. The complaint is that ethnic minorities can attack Han people or rob them, and authorities will seemingly allow it in the name of national unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## [[comparisons_between_han_supremacy_and_other_ethnocentric_ideologies | Parallels and Government Response]]

Racial issues are a challenge for any government with minority and majority populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. China, often seen as a single-race monolith, faces significant ethnic minority problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

There are strong parallels to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. The US founding fathers created a nation binding different races and creeds under concepts of freedom and pursuit of happiness, though the reality of the age fell short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Over decades, Americans have tried to be more inclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. However, there's a darker school of thought believing America's success is built on exclusively Christian values, and another arguing for American white ethnocentrism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

The Chinese nation faces its own version of this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>:
*   **Inclusiveness**: One school of thought advocates for acceptance into Chinese society and even the Han race if one practices Confucian values and rites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This view promotes China as a nation of many races united <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Han Supremacy**: A darker school of thought advocates for an inherent gap between Han people and "barbarians"—a label with deep historical significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. They believe other races are "born barbarians" with barbarian blood, and assimilation attempts would be a "fool's errand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

These sites promoting Han supremacy are present in America, Hong Kong, China, Taiwan, and anywhere Chinese people live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. The problem is most troubling in areas with significant Han majorities, such as China and Singapore, the only Han-majority countries with substantial minority populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

In China, the government has attempted to address these concerns and foster cross-ethnic unity by creating a feeling of "us of China versus them of the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. By portraying all Westerners as foreigners and encouraging an acceptable level of anti-foreign sentiment, it aims to suppress feelings of Han supremacism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. While this tactic might work, its long-term health is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

Han supremacism is a serious and widespread problem, often dismissed as a niche group or internet keyboard warriors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. It's easy for some, including those in government who are Han themselves, to be seduced by the creed of a supreme race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

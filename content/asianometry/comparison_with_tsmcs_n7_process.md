Recent news from TechInsights and SemiAnalysis revealed that SMIC has begun producing chips using their "own" 7-nanometer process node, referred to as N+2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This development prompts a comparison with [[TSMCs technological advancements | TSMC's]] N7 process node, which has been a benchmark in the semiconductor industry.

## Defining "7 Nanometer"
The term "7 nanometer" and other process node numbers are primarily marketing devices designed to convey improvements in chip power, performance, or area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>. They do not correspond to any literal physical dimension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>. Instead, a "7 nanometer" designation typically indicates a 70% improvement over the preceding 10-nanometer generation, which in turn was 70% better than 14-nanometer chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. [[TSMCs technological advancements | TSMC]], to avoid controversy, refers to its 7-nanometer node simply as N7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:01">[01:52:01]</a>.

## SMIC's N+2 Node
SMIC's N+2 node is a successor to their N+1 process, which was first "taped out" in October 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:01">[02:04:01]</a>. Both N+1 and N+2 utilize DUV (Deep Ultraviolet) immersion lithography combined with multi-patterning techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:01">[02:07:01]</a>. Although [[SMICs 7nm process and semiconductor manufacturing | SMIC's N+2]] is technically capable of using EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) technology, the United States has imposed an export ban, blocking [[SMICs 7nm process and semiconductor manufacturing | SMIC's]] ability to acquire such devices from ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:01">[02:20:01]</a>.

## Technological Similarities and Lag
According to SemiAnalysis via TechInsights, [[SMICs 7nm process and semiconductor manufacturing | SMIC's N+2]] is remarkably similar to [[TSMCs N2 process node and new fab locations | TSMC's]] N7, being "99% the same" in terms of physical measurements of transistors (finFETs) and their placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:01">[02:32:01]</a>.

[[TSMCs N2 process node and new fab locations | TSMC]] began shipping N7 chips in high volume in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:01">[02:50:01]</a>. This means that a high-volume N7-equivalent node from [[SMICs 7nm process and semiconductor manufacturing | SMIC]] would place them approximately four to six years behind the leading edge of semiconductor technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:01">[02:56:01]</a>.

## Economic Viability and Market Position
While [[SMICs 7nm process and semiconductor manufacturing | SMIC's N+2]] is one of the most advanced processes offered by any foundry to its customers, its economic competitiveness without EUV technology is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:01">[03:02:01]</a>. Advanced nodes, even beyond N7, can technically be fabricated using 193 nanometer immersion technology with multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:01">[03:16:01]</a>. Dr. Burn Lin, the "father of 193 nanometer immersion lithography" and a former [[TSMCs technological advancements | TSMC]] R&D director, stated in January 2022 that [[SMICs 7nm process and semiconductor manufacturing | SMIC]] could even fabricate N5-equivalent chips with only multi-patterning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:01">[03:28:01]</a>.

However, the key challenge is whether these nodes can yield in meaningful quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:01">[03:47:01]</a>. [[Impact on TSMC and Samsung | Samsung]], despite advanced nodes, has struggled with chip yields, and Intel famously faced difficulties transitioning from their 10-nanometer to 7-nanometer equivalent nodes without EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:01">[03:54:01]</a>. In contrast, [[TSMCs N2 process node and new fab locations | TSMC]] successfully ramped up N7 without significant reported issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:01">[04:14:01]</a>. Given that [[SMICs 7nm process and semiconductor manufacturing | SMIC's N+2]] is very similar to [[TSMCs N2 process node and new fab locations | TSMC's]] N7, it is anticipated to follow a similar yield optimization curve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:01">[04:19:01]</a>.

In an open market, [[SMICs 7nm process and semiconductor manufacturing | SMIC's N+2]] is likely not economically competitive, especially with [[TSMCs N2 process node and new fab locations | TSMC's]] N6, an EUV-equipped evolution of their N7, offering better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:01">[04:53:01]</a>.

## Trade Secrets and Market Strategy
The close resemblance of [[SMICs 7nm process and semiconductor manufacturing | SMIC's N+2]] to [[TSMCs N2 process node and new fab locations | TSMC's]] N7 raises concerns about potential intrusion on trade secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:01">[05:18:01]</a>. In 2002 and 2006, [[TSMCs N2 process node and new fab locations | TSMC]] successfully obtained product import bans on [[SMICs 7nm process and semiconductor manufacturing | SMIC]] products in the U.S. that were made with [[TSMCs technological advancements | TSMC]] trade secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:01">[05:24:01]</a>. If this occurs again, it could eliminate [[SMICs 7nm process and semiconductor manufacturing | SMIC's N+2]] as an export product, limiting its use to domestic Chinese products and exports to allied countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:01">[05:34:01]</a>.

It is possible that [[SMICs 7nm process and semiconductor manufacturing | SMIC]] already anticipates N+2 to be a China-only product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:01">[05:10:01]</a>. The Chinese chip design industry, particularly Huawei's HiSilicon, has matured significantly since the mid-2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:01">[06:00:01]</a>. HiSilicon, a former flagship customer of [[TSMCs N2 process node and new fab locations | TSMC]] (fabricating Kirin 980, 985, and 990 series chips on N7), would likely be keen to use [[SMICs 7nm process and semiconductor manufacturing | N+2]] for high-performing mobile processors and server chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:01">[06:13:01]</a>. This partnership could bring the serious production volumes that foundries rely on to scale and optimize their process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:01">[07:01:01]</a>.

## Impact of Export Controls
The United States government has been pushing the Netherlands (ASML) and Japan (Nikon) to prevent the export of immersion DUV lithography machines to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:01">[09:01:01]</a>. This timing likely coincides with [[SMICs 7nm chip production | SMIC's N+2]] shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:01">[09:10:01]</a>. While EUV machine exports to China have long been blocked, extending this to immersion lithography represents a new step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:01">[09:20:01]</a>.

An export ban on 193 nanometer immersion lithography technology, without a ban on older dry ARF technology (which seems unfeasible), is estimated to add four to six years to [[SMICs 7nm process and semiconductor manufacturing | SMIC's]] progress towards the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:01">[11:13:01]</a>. Such a ban would also likely stimulate substantial investment in Chinese-made lithography equipment, first for maintaining existing immersion equipment, and second for facilitating the dry-to-immersion transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:01">[11:30:01]</a>. Whether Chinese companies can ultimately ship complete systems on par with ASML or Nikon is debatable, but "nothing is insurmountable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:01">[11:51:01]</a>.

A legitimate 7-nanometer node achieving high volume and good yield is a significant triumph for China's advanced manufacturing industry, as only three other companies have reached this level of scale and sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:01">[12:06:01]</a>.

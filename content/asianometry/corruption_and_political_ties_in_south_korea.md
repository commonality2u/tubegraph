[[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence | South Korea's]] greatest economic strengths, its massive business groups like Samsung, Hyundai, and LG, are also its biggest economic weaknesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These groups, while powering the export economy and dominating daily life, also manipulate the Korean economy to their advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. They have historically paid millions to maintain corrupt ties with the highest levels of power in Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Historical Roots of Corruption

Corruption in Korea predates the modern state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The Japanese colonial state, with its agricultural economy, was characterized by corruption and inequality, where large landlords exploited farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. While this administration ended with World War II, many of its legacies were passed on to the new South Korean government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

The first president, Syngman Rhee, recreated the *chaebol* to raise funds for the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. From 1946 through the 1950s, his government sold off assets seized from the Japanese state and other state-owned entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Prices for these privatized public assets were determined by private negotiation rather than public auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, leading to "a steal by any value investing metric" for companies like Tong Yang Beers (now Oriental Brewery), De Haan Textile, and Tong Yang Cement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The purchasers of these assets would eventually become the *chaebol* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Park Chung-hee Era and Crony Capitalism

In 1961, Park Chung-hee led a military coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Immediately after the coup, Park arrested *chaebol* heads for corruptly accumulating wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. However, his government quickly negotiated a [[crony_capitalism_in_indonesia | crony capitalism]] deal with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Park sought to emulate Japan's industrialization and needed the companies' help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The agreement involved the *chaebol* supporting Park's policies for import substitution and later exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. In return, the Korean government lent the *chaebol* foreign currency loans at below-market interest rates to acquire foreign technologies and build capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Additionally, the *chaebol* contributed funds for Park's presidential election campaigns, often in the form of 10-15% loan commissions, or kickbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Companies realized that being "good friends with the president" was the best way to acquire cheap capital and get rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Park Chung-hee maintained close personal ties with leaders like Chung Ju-yung of Hyundai and Kim Woo-jung of Daewoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

These kickbacks grew significantly; the top five *chaebol* contributed over 800 million won annually to the Park government before 1972, which increased to 1.5 billion won after 1972 (adjusted to 1990 prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

For the next 20 years, the government and the *chaebol* ran Korean society as dominant actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Companies funded political campaigns and helped grow the economy, while the government granted privileges and imposed the costs of *chaebol* excesses onto society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For example, in 1971, when the *chaebol* were over-leveraged, the government converted their private market loans to five-year public ones and froze private interest rates, harming small lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Shifting Power and Growing Inequality

As Korea entered the turbulent 1980s, the military dictatorship's grip on power weakened, and the partnership with the *chaebol* became shaky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. By the mid-1980s, the balance of power had shifted decisively in the *chaebol's* favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The top five *chaebol* accounted for nearly 20% of the country's GDP and 45% of its mining/manufacturing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The top ten *chaebol* owned an average of 8.6 manufacturing businesses, totaling 20 to 40 businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

[[south_koreas_economic_strategies_for_shipping_industry | South Korea's]] *chaebol*-centric strategy suffocated the country's small and medium-sized business sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. From 1966 to 1976, manufacturing firms grew by only 10% in number but exploded in size by 176% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. In contrast, Taiwan, with a less cozy state-business relationship, saw its number of manufacturing firms grow by 150% and firm size by 29% over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

This vast imbalance between the *chaebol* and the rest of the country became a major issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. As the people of South Korea became richer, they desired more than just higher wages; they wanted better environmental regulations, working conditions, and a better life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The government, increasingly democratic, had to respond by shifting from support to regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Despite this, political leaders continued to rely on the *chaebol's* financial contributions to stay in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. After Park Chung-hee's assassination, Chun Doo-hwan's administration received 15-22 billion won from the *chaebol* for high-level political campaigns, and the subsequent administration of President Roh Tae-woo received 21-25 billion won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This corrupt relationship persisted partly due to the weakness of Korea's political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. When the country democratized in 1987, the lack of suitable campaigning norms and above-board financing systems left parties vulnerable to corruption, allowing *chaebol* to continue receiving government aid, favorable regulations, and protection from competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Asian Financial Crisis and Reforms

The Asian Financial Crisis demonstrated the consequences of Korea's inability to rein in its big businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. In the decade following democratization in 1987, the *chaebol* gained substantial political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. For example, in 1988, Daewoo Group influenced the National Assembly to amend the law to bail out its ailing shipbuilding corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. They also pushed for rapid liberalization reforms to aid their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

One such reform allowed *chaebol* easier access to foreign capital financing, leading to a massive debt boom that culminated in the Asian Financial Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Another reform permitted limited ownership stakes in non-bank financial companies, encouraging complex cross-ownership structures that obscured their true size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. For instance, the Lee family, controlling Samsung Group, exercised operating control over almost all affiliated companies with only a minority shareholding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. These complex structures meant nobody knew which subsidiaries were profitable, leading to profitable companies propping up weak ones and causing market inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The crisis in 1997 vastly curtailed the power of the *chaebol*, creating an opportunity for [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun administrations imposed various reforms to prevent another financial crisis by limiting debt capacity and cross-shareholder structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. These [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | reforms]] had consequences, such as forcing Hanjin Shipping to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio, leading to the sale of ships and increased operating costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The Korean car industry, which had five independent companies in 1997, consolidated to just one, Hyundai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. The *chaebol* also reduced their affiliates and separated them, with 819 affiliates in 1997 shrinking to 544 three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Dividends to minority shareholders increased significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

The crisis also helped create the Korean export juggernaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Faced with an unfriendly domestic environment, the biggest *chaebol* embraced free trade agreements in the 2000s and turned outwards, becoming wildly successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. By 2013, 86% of Samsung's revenue came from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This success drove Korea's top-line economic recovery, with an average growth rate of 5% from 1998 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

## Social Inequality and Recent Political Responses

Despite impressive GDP growth, this period hid troubling [[social_inequality_and_the_role_of_big_business_in_south_korea | social issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. The benefits of growth were concentrated among a small cohort, leading to a significant gap between the "haves" and "have-nots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. In 2013, *chaebol* accounted for over 50% of revenue and value-add in manufacturing but employed less than 20% of the sector's employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. As part of post-1997 reform negotiations, the government allowed *chaebol* to lay off workers more easily to improve profitability, leading to hundreds of thousands losing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Many never found regular salaried work, resulting in irregular employment and elder poverty reaching four times the OECD average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. The income share for the top 1% of Korean society rose from 7% before 1997 to 12% in the mid-2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

Recognizing this inequality, the Korean people voted for change in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. President Lee Myung-bak, a conservative former businessman and CEO of Hyundai Construction, campaigned on economic recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. He promised to raise GDP growth to 7%, achieve a per capita income of $40,000, and make Korea the seventh-largest economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. He won with the highest margin in years, but record low voter participation indicated a loss of faith in the government's ability to curb social inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Lee's policies favored big business, lowering corporate tax rates, raising investment ceilings for non-bank financial institutions, and amnestying executives convicted after the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. However, his administration failed to deliver the promised growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. In 2018, Lee was arrested for bribery, embezzlement, and tax fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

In 2012, conservative Park Geun-hye campaigned with a mix of nostalgia for past "glory years" and a stronger emphasis on welfare, though notably not advocating for a higher capital gains tax, which was key to the accelerating wealth gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

Modern corruption by the *chaebol* focuses on maximizing wealth and market power through tax manipulations and regulatory capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. The consequences of these actions became starkly apparent with the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking, which claimed 304 lives, mostly high school students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. The high death rate was largely due to ignored safety and rescue regulations, enabled by a close working relationship between the regulatory agency and the ferry company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. This status quo included the rotation of government employees into the industry and the ferry company's monopoly privilege on the lucrative Incheon-Jeju ferry route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

[[political_and_financial_environment_in_south_korea | South Korea's]] struggle with its biggest companies continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. President Park Geun-hye's administration ended in corruption scandals and impeachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Her successor, President Moon Jae-in, implemented business reforms and higher tax rates, leading to some improvement in public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. However, the South Korean economy is highly dependent on its powerful global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, and substantial reform risks weakening their global market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. This issue, along with North Korea, remains a furiously debated topic in South Korean presidential politics due to increasing societal polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

A [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)]] is an integrated circuit that can be reprogrammed after manufacture to emulate a digital circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. These devices are useful for prototyping new functionalities before mass production or for rare use cases that do not make a custom chip economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. While [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | FPGAs]] were not the first with this capability, they are the most commercially successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Early Needs and Challenges
Before [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGAs]], engineers had limited options for prototyping logic functions on hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. They could use TTL chips, which were limited by board size and power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The other option was to get a custom chip, known today as an [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This involved substantial upfront costs, paying for a photo mask, and waiting months for fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Mistakes in design were costly, as they could not be easily corrected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The need for a reprogrammable circuit became more compelling as integrated circuits became more widely adopted after the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

The first integrated circuits capable of programmable logic were Programmable Read-Only Memories (PROMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. In 1970, Harris Semiconductor introduced PROMs that could implement an array of programmable logic gates with a fixed AND set and a programmable OR set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Programming involved burning fusible metal links, making them one-time use only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. However, using PROMs for programmable logic was inefficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

In 1975, Signetics introduced the [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | Programmable Logic Array (PLA)]], which allowed both the AND and OR logic gate sets to be programmable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. While this offered greater flexibility, it required a much larger and more expensive chip, costing around $25 in 1975 ($140 today), and still involved burning fuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | PLAs]] never really caught on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

In 1977, Monolithic Memories created the [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | Programmable Array Logic (PAL)]] by modifying the [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | PLA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | PAL]] traded some configurability for better performance and cost, keeping the programmable AND set but making the OR set fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | PAL]] design also included sequential logic circuits via macrocells, making them more practical for everyday use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. By the early 1980s, new technologies allowed these circuits to be reprogrammable, such as using ultraviolet light to erase them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | PALs]] found some success and were widely adopted, especially by memory makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## Emergence of Key Players: Altera and Xilinx

Despite the success of [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | PALs]], their structure did not scale well with [[impact_of_moores_law_on_fpga_growth_and_capabilities | Moore's Law]], leading to performance slowdowns as the AND gate set grew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This opened the door for new companies.

### Altera's Innovation
In 1980, engineers from Intel, Signetics, and Intersil founded Altera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Their experience with [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | ASIC]] chip makers led them to pursue their own field-programmable hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. In July 1984, Altera released the EP300, a simple programmable logic device made with a CMOS EEPROM process that was erasable and reprogrammable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Altera pioneered the [[early_challenges_and_developments_in_fpga_technology | Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD)]] by connecting smaller [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | PALs]] with crossbar connections, making them more scalable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Altera's use of CMOS, sourcing it from Ricoh in Japan, was also impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Altera's success heralded the beginning of the fabless design model that now drives the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Xilinx and the First FPGA
In the mid-1980s, Ross Freeman at Zilog envisioned making a piece of silicon that could meet everyone's needs as transistors became cheaper due to [[impact_of_moores_law_on_fpga_growth_and_capabilities | Moore's Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. He founded Xilinx in February 1984 with co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Xilinx partnered with Seiko Corporation to produce their new chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Bill Carter, a young designer, was hired to design the product with guidance only from Freeman's patent application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

The result was the Xilinx XC2064, the first true [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGA]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Unlike [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | PALs]], [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGAs]] removed the large AND gate set and instead featured an array of configurable logic blocks connected by programmable switches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Each logic block contained lookup tables, allowing the [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGA]] to implement arbitrary logic functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. The interconnects between blocks were also programmable, enabling flexible routing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Early [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGAs]] required external memory to store programming when power was off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

The XC2064 was a large chip for its time, with 85,000 transistors arranged into 64 configurable logic blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Its sheer size strained Seiko's manufacturing capabilities, resulting in extremely low yields; out of 25 wafers, only one worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and FPGA Dominance

Initially, [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGAs]] competed directly with [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | PALs]], but they were far more expensive due to their large die size and low yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | PALs]] were cheaper as their structure resembled memory chips, allowing memory makers to churn them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Additionally, the newness of the [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGA]] made it harder to use, requiring complex Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software from Xilinx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

Despite these [[early_challenges_and_developments_in_fpga_technology | early challenges]], the [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGA]] thrived for several reasons:

*   **[[impact_of_moores_law_on_fpga_growth_and_capabilities | Moore's Law]]**: The launch of [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGAs]] coincided with maturing lithography technologies, which accelerated classical scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Since [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGAs]] could scale while [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | PALs]] could not, [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGAs]] directly benefited from crashing transistor costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. The advent of chemical mechanical polishing also drastically reduced the cost of making [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGA]] interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Fabless Design Model**: The early 1990s saw the rise of independent foundries, with Altera and Xilinx pioneering the fabless startup model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. This allowed design groups to raise money and approach foundries without needing to master semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Foundries, in turn, found [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGAs]] with their large dies useful for honing their processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. This led to a blossoming [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGA]] market with many new startups, whose innovations and patents were often absorbed by Xilinx and Altera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.
*   **Software Control**: A critical differentiator was software. While [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | PAL]] EDA software was simple and widely available through third parties, this meant [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | PAL]] manufacturers did not control the software and thus had limited agency over their hardware's capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. This led to [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | PAL]] makers producing similar hardware, driving the market to the lowest common denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. In contrast, [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGA]] companies like Xilinx and Altera controlled their own EDA, allowing them to dictate their future by crafting software to enable more features and automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

## Major Acquisitions and Current Landscape
Xilinx and Altera continued to hold the majority share of the multi-billion dollar [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGA]] industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. However, both companies are no longer independent:
*   Intel acquired Altera in 2015 for approximately $16.7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
*   AMD acquired Xilinx for an estimated $50 billion, with the deal closing in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

Today, [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGAs]] are widely used across various industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. As [[differences_between_fpga_pal_pla_and_asic | ASICs]] become increasingly expensive to design and fabricate, [[history_and_evolution_of_field_programmable_gate_arrays_fpga | FPGAs]] have filled a valuable market gap, particularly in aerospace, military, and telecom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. They continue to gain new functionalities and are expanding into areas such as [[the_ai_and_ai_chip_boom_landscape | AI processing]] and data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

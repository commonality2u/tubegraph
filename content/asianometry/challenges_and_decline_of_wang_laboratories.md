The story of Wang Laboratories, founded by An Wang, illustrates the [[rise_and_fall_of_wang_laboratories | rise and fall of a computing pioneer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. An Wang, an incredible engineer and brilliant businessman, built the company on his ability to innovate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. However, despite early success, the company faced significant challenges that ultimately led to its downfall.

## An Wang's Leadership and Succession Issues

An Wang was a highly intelligent and consumed by his work, meticulously reviewing even the company's mail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. He was a micromanager who demanded a lot from his employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. A critical aspect of his vision was that the company was his to control and eventually pass to his son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This [[impact_of_family_dynamics_on_wang_laboratories | impact of family dynamics]] would prove detrimental to the company's future.

By 1980, An Wang, then 60, began to slow down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. In 1982, he started spending less time at the office and formally retired in 1983, appointing John A. Cunningham, a respected sales employee, as president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. An Wang, however, remained Chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

Despite his retirement, An Wang continued to be deeply involved, particularly in product development, spending an estimated 65% of his time there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. His decision to put his son, Fred Wang, in charge of the critical R&D department in 1980, proved to be a disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. Fred, though smart, lacked his father's touch in managing the powerful egos within the R&D division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.

## Product Development Setbacks

The company's turning point largely stemmed from product issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. In October 1983, Wang Labs announced 14 new products, including the Wang Professional Image Computer, with the aim of competing with IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. While the market initially reacted positively, causing the stock to soar and An Wang's personal wealth to peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>, the products came out very late, in some cases years late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Fred had rushed the announcements, severely damaging his credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

### Missing the PC Revolution

This period of product delays coincided with the rise of the IBM PC, released two years prior, which rapidly gained market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. These personal computers, equipped with word processing and spreadsheet software, began to erode Wang's specialized word processors and 2200 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

An Wang stubbornly resisted the PC, viewing it as a "future dead end commodity," similar to the calculator market he had exited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. Although Fred eventually pushed the company to build its own PC, it lacked compatibility with the IBM PC's vast software ecosystem, making it "Dead on Arrival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

## Financial Decline and Leadership Turmoil

The botched 1983 product announcement marked a point from which the company never truly recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>. Cunningham, the company president, came to believe Fred could not manage R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. In October 1984, An Wang moved Fred to run manufacturing, replacing an excellent executive, overriding Cunningham's objections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. The R&D department continued to produce failures, and debt piled up as the company recklessly expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>.

An Wang's loyalty to his family jeopardized the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. He rejected potential mergers that could have shored up the company's debt position, fearing it would take control away from the Wang family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.

In April 1985, Wang Labs announced a stunning 66% quarterly profit decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. In July 1985, Cunningham resigned, selling all his stock, marking the beginning of the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. An Wang briefly took over, but in 1987, he made Fred the company president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. The company experienced unsteady profits, laying off thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. The board repeatedly asked to bring in a professional manager to work with Fred, but An Wang famously refused, stating, "He is my son, and he can do it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

Losses mounted throughout 1988, poisoning relations with banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. In July 1989, Wang posted a staggering $424 million annual loss, suspending dividends and laying off more staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. The stock crashed from $43 to just $5 a share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

## Final Chapter and Bankruptcy

In 1989, An Wang was diagnosed with esophageal cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. In August 1989, he was forced to fire his own son, Fred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. Richard Miller, a turnaround expert, was appointed president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. Miller oversaw massive asset sales and further layoffs but the company still reported a $715.9 million loss in 1990, despite $2.5 billion in revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

An Wang's illness progressed, and he lost his ability to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>. He died on March 24, 1990, at age 70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>. In his last conversation with Miller, he asked him to try and save Wang Labs and preserve its name as a company founded by an immigrant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.

Despite efforts, including an alliance with IBM, Wang Laboratories filed for bankruptcy in 1992, two years after its founder's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. It was acquired in 1999 by the Dutch company Getronics and renamed Getronics North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

### Key Factors in Decline

The failure of Wang Laboratories can be attributed to several critical factors:
*   An Wang's resistance to the PC revolution and the power of office software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
*   The company's inability to find a new hit product after its initial successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>.
*   The severe turmoil over the company's succession plan, specifically the [[impact_of_family_dynamics_on_wang_laboratories | elevation of Fred Wang]] to leadership roles for which he was not prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.

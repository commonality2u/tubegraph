The hard disk drive (HDD) industry, despite producing a "wondrous piece of technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, became a "graveyard for profits for years on end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> due in part to the significant influence of venture capital (VC) investment. This influx of funding fueled a rapid expansion of firms, accelerating the commoditization and eventual bust of the market.

## The Enabling Environment for Venture Capital

The emergence of venture capital as a dominant force in the tech industry was facilitated by significant shifts in the late 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Changes to capital gains tax rates and pension fund investment regulations created an environment where VCs could raise large funds and deploy capital into promising new sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

## Seagate's IPO and the VC Blueprint

[[key_innovations_and_technological_advancements_in_hard_disk_drives | Seagate Technology]], founded by Alan Shugart to adapt the IBM Winchester drive for microcomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, played a pivotal role in demonstrating the lucrative potential of VC investment in the HDD space. [[key_innovations_and_technological_advancements_in_hard_disk_drives | Seagate]] announced their ST506 hard drive in 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, and despite a price tag over $1,000, it was an immediate success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

[[key_innovations_and_technological_advancements_in_hard_disk_drives | Seagate]] went public in September 1981, just over a year after launching their HDD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. The company raised $26 million and was assigned a favorable market multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. This success translated into significant returns for its venture capitalists; a $1 million investment became worth over $32 million after the IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. This outcome established a blueprint for how VCs would invest and cash out their investments in subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

## The "Piling In" Effect

The success of companies like [[key_innovations_and_technological_advancements_in_hard_disk_drives | Seagate]] ignited a "hot" market, leading VCs to raise large funds and pour money into the disk drive industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. They actively recruited smart individuals from established companies to found new startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

By mid-1983, there were 12 VC-backed HDD manufacturers publicly traded on the stock market, with a combined market capitalization of $5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Between 1977 and 1984, 43 different disk drive manufacturers collectively raised $400 million in funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. The years 1983 and 1984 alone saw 21 startups raise over $270 million across 51 rounds of funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. In total, approximately seventy firms were active in the market by this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

## Consequences for the Industry

The rapid influx of VC money and the resulting "Zerg rush of entrants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a> drastically changed the HDD market. This oversupply, coupled with a pullback in the PC market in 1983 and 1984, triggered a massive shakeout, leading to the failure of many startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

In 1978, the "old vertically integrated HDD companies" held 84.8% of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Just over ten years later, these established players had seen their market share plummet to a mere 7.9%, effectively being driven out of the market by the new, VC-backed entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

This intense competition, fueled by venture capital, led to significant [[factors_leading_to_the_commoditization_and_eventual_bust_of_the_hdd_market | commoditization]] and consolidation within the industry. The number of HDD firms peaked at 66 in 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>, but over the next four years, this number was halved to 33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. By 1998, only 16 firms remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

The rise of venture capital played a crucial role in shaping the [[history_and_evolution_of_hard_disk_drives | history and evolution of hard disk drives]], driving rapid innovation and expansion, but ultimately contributing to the volatile boom and bust cycles that characterized the industry for decades.

At the start of the 1960s, the [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet Union]] was the world's second-largest oil producer, trailing only the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Its production nearly matched that of the entire Middle East, and many European countries relied on [[soviet_energy_trade_relationships_with_eastern_bloc_and_western_europe | Soviet oil]], which the Communist Party leveraged to its advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The foundation for this "Titanic Soviet oil apparatus" was laid during the Russian Empire in the late 1880s and further developed following World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Russian Empire: The Rise of Baku

The origins of Russia's significant oil production began in the late 1820s when the Russian Empire annexed the city of Baku from the Iranians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Throughout the 19th century, Baku grew to become one of the world's leading oil production sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. By its peak in the 1880s, Baku's oil production reached one-third of America's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. By 1914, 90% of Russia's oil originated from Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

The Czar owned all the oil fields, and his government generated a quarter of its total revenues through indirect taxes on oil production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Over 20 private companies, including the prominent Nobel Brothers (Branobel), managed the fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The Nobel Brothers, known for their long-standing ties to the Russian Empire as arms dealers, were foreign pioneers in Baku's oil industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. In 1873, Robert Nobel purchased an oil refinery, leading him and his brother Ludwig to establish the Nobel Brothers oil production company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. At its peak, Nobel Brothers was one of the largest oil companies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Russia's modern oil industry traces its roots to the systems and practices introduced by the Nobels, including oil pipelines and tankers, which allowed for more economical oil transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This thriving private oil industry in Baku was partly due to a more corporate-friendly shift in Russian tsarist policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Industrialists aimed to export their millions of barrels and challenge the global Standard Oil monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. However, a lack of funds and internal divisions prevented this opportunity from materializing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

By 1916, the Baku oil industry had begun to stagnate, with overall production declining from a peak of 11.5 million metric tons in 1901 to 9.4 million metric tons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. After 1904, Russia never managed to export more than a million tons of its production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## Bolshevik Takeover and the New Economic Policy

With the collapse of the Russian Empire, foreign oil companies like Shell and other British firms attempted to annex Russia's oil regions, but the British government refused military backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Consequently, Western oil companies suffered massive financial losses when the Soviets nationalized all their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Shell, for example, lost about 171.4 million Rubles of British capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

During the Russian Civil War, the non-Russian ethnic peoples of Baku attempted to establish the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. However, Lenin and the Bolsheviks desperately needed Baku's oil for their armies and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. In December 1920, the Red Army reconquered the area, but they found a "wasteland" where production was just a third of pre-war numbers due to natural decline and war damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

In 1921, facing a Soviet economy in shambles, Lenin initiated a reversal from central planning with the New Economic Policy (NEP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. A controversial aspect of the NEP was the potential resumption of concessions to foreign capitalists to exploit natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Despite opposition from figures like Alexei Rykov, Mikhail Tomsky, and Joseph Stalin, Lenin advocated for this policy, arguing it was necessary to receive the benefits of advanced modern capitalist technology for industrial development, particularly in petroleum extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. He believed that without foreign technology, the foundations for large-scale industry could not be built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

Reports from Baku indicated broken transportation links, supply shortages, and saltwater intrusions into the oil fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. In April 1921, workers in Baku struck due to chronic shortages and poor working conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. These conditions led to recommendations that the Soviets engage with global oil syndicates as soon as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Failed Foreign Concessions and Renewed Domestic Efforts

After nationalization, Nobel Brothers strategically sold half of their Russian oil assets to Standard Oil of New Jersey (forerunner of ExxonMobil) for $7-9 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Standard Oil, Shell, and Anglo-Persian Oil Company entered negotiations for vast concession tracks in Baku and Grozny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. A deal almost materialized for Standard and Anglo-Persian to control half of Grozny and build a pipeline to the Black Sea, but Standard eventually passed under pressure from the Warren G. Harding Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

Despite Lenin's push, the vast foreign concessions deal never fully materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. For example, Sinclair Oil Corporation offered a $250 million loan for a near-complete 25-year monopoly on Grozny's richest oil areas, which the Soviets declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Sinclair was granted a concession to Sakhalin Island, but the Japanese prevented drilling, and the company later pulled out due to the Teapot Dome scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The U.S. government, seeing the Soviet regime as illegitimate due to repudiated debts, nationalized property, and advocacy for overthrowing the American government, discouraged trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This, combined with Lenin's illnesses, closed the window for significant foreign capitalism in the [[economic_challenges_of_early_soviet_union | early Soviet Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

However, this was not a significant loss as the Soviets began to drill again on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Oil production surged from 4.2 million metric tons in 1921 to 6.3 million in 1924 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This recovery was aided by British equipment, particularly from Vickers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Vickers, despite significant losses from Soviet nationalization, opted to engage with the Soviets, selling them turbines for the national electrification plan (GOELRO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. In 1924, Vickers demonstrated modern oil drilling equipment to a Soviet delegation, leading to its deployment in Baku and Grozny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

To pay for this equipment, the Soviets turned to oil exports, as grain exports were impractical due to difficult relations with the peasantry (the "scissors crisis") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Over two years, Vickers delivered millions of pounds worth of oil equipment in exchange for a percentage of Soviet foreign oil sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. By 1926, oil became one of the country's few profitable export sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Underfunding and Strategic Oversight

Despite oil becoming a profitable export, the Soviets initially did not prioritize its domestic use, focusing instead on hydropower, electrification, and coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This was a curious attitude given that Soviet energy consumption grew over 13% annually throughout the 1920s and 30s, and domestic gasoline needs, driven by the Red Army's mechanization, reached 3 million tons a year by 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

Several Soviet geologists, including Ivan Gubkin, insisted on the existence of large oil deposits in the Volga-Ural basin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. However, despite some wells being drilled, the Soviets declined to invest significantly in exploiting these reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This reluctance stemmed from a belief that the world had a finite amount of oil, making it too expensive and rare to compete with alternatives like coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Instead, they invested heavily in coal liquefaction, seeing it as more sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Consequently, on the eve of World War II, the Soviet oil industry was stagnant and underfunded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## World War II and the "Second Baku"

The Nazi German invasion in June 1941, Operation Barbarossa, drastically changed the Soviet approach to oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Germany, lacking a reliable oil supply and relying on Romanian oil and its own coal liquefaction industry, launched Case Blue in 1942, aiming to capture the oil-rich cities of the Caucasus, including Baku and Grozny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. However, logistical issues and winter conditions halted German forces far short of their oil field objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

Expect the Germans to arrive at Baku, the Red Army rapidly evacuated personnel and machinery from the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. Drilling equipment, pipelines, and entire refineries were disassembled and relocated to the Volga-Ural area, which became known as the "Second Baku" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. As a result, oil production in the Caucasus was devastated, dropping by over 50% in a single year to levels not seen since the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Azerbaijani historians note that production rates did not return to 1941 levels until after the [[collapse_of_the_soviet_union_linked_to_oil_and_gas_industry_challenges | Soviet Union dissolved]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

The Soviets scrambled to increase production in the Volga-Ural fields, despite challenges with high-sulfur crude oils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. They mixed Baku and Volga-Ural oils and received aid from the Americans, who sent six refineries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Stalin himself stressed the importance of petroleum, calling it the "soul of military equipment" and hailing oilmen as "Warriors at the oil front" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. However, [[soviet_industrial_growth_and_technological_lag | Soviet technology]] and time constraints meant Volga-Ural production never fully replaced the lost output from Baku during the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. For more on [[soviet_oil_strategy_during_world_war_ii | Soviet oil strategy during World War II]], this period marked a critical turning point.

## Post-War Expansion

The war instilled in the Soviets the critical importance of oil and petroleum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. After it ended, they aimed to control as much oil as possible, reflected in their occupation of Romania and temporary control of Austria's oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. The Soviet Union depended on imported oil from these countries until the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. To revitalize production, the Red Army confiscated oil technologies, much of it originally from the West, and sent it home as war booty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

Throughout the 1950s, the Soviets significantly invested in [[development_of_oil_and_gas_infrastructure_in_west_siberia | developing the oil fields]] of the Volga-Ural Basin, shifting priority away from Baku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. This bet paid off, and by the end of the 1950s, fields like Romashkino, spanning 4,200 square kilometers (six times the size of Singapore), produced more oil than all other regions combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The Volga-Urals Basin remains a significant oil production area today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. This success was just a taste of the future [[rise_of_the_soviet_union_as_an_energy_superpower | Soviet energy superpower]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

From almost the very beginning, the [[economic_and_environmental_impacts_of_soviet_oil_production | Soviet Union]] utilized its vast natural resources for survival and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Oil and gas helped Lenin industrialize the country and fueled the Red Army's victory over Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. As production expanded, the Soviets began exporting energy, initially to earn foreign currency for goods like wheat, meat, or advanced technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. Over time, these energy exports became a tool for flexing political muscles and maintaining leverage over satellite states and allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. This tributary arrangement would ultimately contribute to the [[collapse_of_the_soviet_union_linked_to_oil_and_gas_industry_challenges | Soviet Union's downfall]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

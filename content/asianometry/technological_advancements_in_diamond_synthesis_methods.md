The price of natural diamonds has historically been unrelated to their extraction cost, primarily due to various supply cartels throughout history that carefully managed supply to maintain high prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. For centuries, market entities manipulated prices upwards, with examples dating back to ancient India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. In the 1500s, a half-carat diamond could cost the equivalent of 30,000 days of an average laborer's wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The discovery of diamonds in Brazil in 1725 caused prices to drop significantly until the Portuguese Crown limited supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The most famous cartel, De Beers, emerged after the discovery of large diamond deposits in South Africa in 1866 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. De Beers consolidated the mining industry by 1888, imposing production limits to stabilize prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Under Ernst Oppenheimer, De Beers established the Central Selling Organization (CSO), which purchased all raw production from producers at a fixed profit-guaranteeing price and then resold them to jewelry cutting factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The CSO also pioneered a marketing campaign in 1938, famously tying diamonds to romance with the slogan "A diamond is forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Early Attempts at Diamond Synthesis

The desire to create diamonds artificially has existed for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. In 1797, Smithson Tennant demonstrated that diamonds are a form of carbon by burning them in oxygen to produce carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Scientists recognized that diamonds were denser than other forms of carbon like charcoal, leading to early attempts to create them by subjecting carbon to high pressure and heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Notable scientists, James Hannay and Nobel Prize-winner Ferdinand Frederick Henry Moissan, claimed success in the late 1800s, but their results could not be replicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The technology of their era was simply not capable of achieving the necessary conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Scientific Roadmap for Diamond Creation

A more scientific approach was needed for [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds_and_their_impact_on_the_market | diamond synthesis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. A significant breakthrough occurred in 1915 when Gilbert Lewis and Merle Randall showed that diamond and graphite were in equilibrium at 10,000 atmospheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This work allowed scientists to map out the state of carbon under various temperatures and pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. The "road map" revealed that creating diamond not only requires 2000 degrees Celsius but also over a million pounds per square inch of pressure, potentially less if a metal catalyst or solvent is used to accelerate the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## High-Pressure, High-Temperature (HPHT) Method

### ASEA's First Synthetic Diamond

In February 1953, researchers at the General Swedish Electrical Limited Company (ASEA) produced the first synthetic diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. They developed a complex device: a sealed hollow cube with a core surrounded by six anvils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Hydraulic force pushed the anvils together, applying pressure to the core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Heat was generated by igniting thermite with an electric filament, heating an inner graphite core to 2000 degrees Celsius for about 1.5 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Initial attempts failed until they added iron as a solvent inside the core, inserting a mixture of cementite and graphite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This process, under conditions of about 80,000 bar (1.2 million PSI) and 2000 degrees Celsius, yielded small diamond crystals about 0.1 millimeters across <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. ASEA did not immediately publicize or patent their work, which allowed GE to later overshadow their achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### GE's Contributions to HPHT

In 1951, General Electric (GE) formed a group to produce synthetic diamonds, driven by supply chain concerns as they were a major diamond consumer for industrial grit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Collaborating with physicist P.W. Bridgman, GE modified one of his designs to create a "belt apparatus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This device used two cone-shaped anvils to press down on a small pressure chamber, capable of exerting three million PSI at 3400 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. At these extreme conditions, carbon (graphite) could transition directly into diamond without an additional solvent or catalyst, resulting in small crystals, about one millimeter wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Initially, these small synthetic diamonds were not seen as a threat to De Beers, which dealt in much larger gemstone diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Researchers later discovered that by using a small seed diamond and tightly controlling heat and pressure, they could grow diamonds as large as three carats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. However, these diamonds were typically dark-colored, low-quality, and exhibited an undesirable onion-like structure, making them more suitable for industrial use than jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

By 1970, scientists achieved a significant breakthrough: creating a large, gem-quality crystal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The key was a prolonged growth time; a one-carat diamond (about five millimeters across) takes about a week to grow, as attempts to speed up the process introduce flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. However, this "long cook time" made the process economically infeasible, and the resulting crystals were often yellow, easily distinguishable from natural diamonds using UV fluorescence or absorption spectroscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The HPHT method, while effective, proved costly and had significant limitations for producing gem-quality stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) Method

Researchers began to explore alternative methods, wondering if diamonds could be grown in a low-pressure environment without expensive HPHT equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

### Early CVD Experiments

From 1952 to 1953, William Eversole of Union Carbide conducted experiments where he heated a carbon-containing gas in the presence of a seed diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The carbon atoms from the gas attached to the diamond surface, increasing its mass without requiring high pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. This method, known as [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), is heavily used in the [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Eversole's work was largely overlooked for a period as the industry favored the HPHT method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

### Atomic Hydrogen Breakthroughs

In 1963, Dr. John Angus of Case Western Reserve University formed a team to replicate and continue Eversole's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. They discovered that atomic hydrogen was key to successfully growing pure, gem-quality diamonds with CVD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. During the CVD process, not all carbon attaches as diamond; a significant portion forms graphite, an impurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Initially, Angus's team used alternating growth and cleaning cycles, with sulfuric acid to etch off the unwanted graphite, a method similar to those in [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | semiconductor manufacturing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. A PhD student suggested using an atomic hydrogen stream from a tungsten filament for cleaning, which performed much better and allowed both growth and cleaning steps to occur in the same chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

In 1971, Angus presented his work in the Soviet Union, mentioning his use of atomic hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. A Soviet team then pioneered a second critical breakthrough: using atomic hydrogen not only during the cleaning phase but also throughout the growth phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This innovation helped suppress graphite formation and converted any graphite that did form into a gas, removing it from the diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

Their findings influenced a team at the National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials in Japan during the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This Japanese team used a hot filament or microwaves to activate a mixture of hydrogen and methane, accelerating growth to a few micrometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

## Impact on the Diamond Market

One by one, the CVD industry overcame its limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. By the 1990s, the industry was capable of making single-crystal synthetic diamonds in various colors, and these gem-quality synthetics began appearing in the jewelry market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

In response, De Beers invested in new ways to detect synthetic diamonds, utilizing UV fluorescence, X-rays, and advanced spectroscopy tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. While effective for a time, synthetics rapidly eliminated these detectable weaknesses, reaching a point where they can only be identified in a lab with very advanced tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

This technological advancement coincided with significant changes in the diamond industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. The fall of the Soviet Union and new deposits in Australia led to new competitors, disrupting the old cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. In 2000, De Beers restructured to become more of a traditional luxury company, shifting its marketing and partnering with brands like Louis Vuitton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

In 2020, De Beers announced that they would begin producing and selling their own synthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This move reflects an embrace of the [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds_and_their_impact_on_the_market | synthetic diamond industry's technological advances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. The shift is compared to the pearl market transition in the 1910s, where Japanese cultured pearl farming led to consumers preferring synthetic pearls due to their rounder, better look, environmental friendliness, and lower exploitation of workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Today, virtually every pearl sold in jewelry shops is cultured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

Modern gem-quality CVD synthetic diamonds are described as more beautiful, ideal-looking, better for the environment, produced with less worker exploitation, and far cheaper than natural diamonds, making them an "all-around better product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. While [[comparison_of_synthetic_and_natural_diamonds_in_the_jewelry_industry | synthetic diamonds]] are indeed breaking the diamond market, it's not in a way that devalues the stone itself, but rather shifts the premium from the scarcity of the stone to the scarcity of a luxury brand like De Beers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

South Korea's economy is largely defined by its massive business groups, known as Chaebol, which include globally recognized names such as Samsung, Hyundai, and LG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. While these groups are a significant strength, powering the export economy and dominating daily life, they also represent a major economic weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. They have been known to manipulate the Korean economy to their advantage and maintain [[corruption_and_political_ties_in_south_korea | corrupt ties]] with the highest levels of power through significant financial contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Historical Roots and Formation of Chaebol

[[corruption_and_political_ties_in_south_korea | Corruption]] in Korea predates the modern state, with the Japanese colonial administration and its agricultural economy being both corrupt and unequal, characterized by landlords exploiting farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. While this administration ended with World War II, many of its legacies were passed on to the new South Korean government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee, initiated the creation of the Chaebol to raise funds for the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Starting in 1946 and peaking in the 1950s, his government privatized many assets seized from the old Japanese state and other state-owned entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. These privatizations were conducted through private negotiations rather than public auctions, leading to favorable deals for purchasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Valuable companies like Tong Yang Beers (now Oriental Breweries), Daehan Textile, and Tong Yang Cement became part of groups like the Tongyang Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Much like the [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan | Zaibatsu of Japan]], the purchasers of these assets would eventually become the Chaebol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## The Era of Crony Capitalism under Park Chung-hee

In 1961, Park Chung-hee led a military coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Initially, Park arrested Chaebol heads for corrupt wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. However, his government quickly negotiated a "crony capitalism" deal with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Park sought to emulate Japan's industrialization and needed the companies' cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The Chaebol agreed to support Park's policies for import substitution and later exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. In return, the government provided foreign currency loans at below-market interest rates, enabling them to acquire foreign technologies and build industrial capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. These loans also came with commissions (kickbacks) of 10% to 15%, contributing funds to Park's presidential campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This established a pattern where companies realized that close ties with the president were the best way to secure cheap capital and grow rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Park Chung-hee maintained close personal relationships with figures like Chung Ju-yung of Hyundai and Kim Woo-jung of [[history_and_rise_of_daewoo_group | Daewoo]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Kickbacks to the government increased significantly over the years; adjusted to 1990 prices, the top five Chaebol contributed over 800 million won annually before 1972, which grew to 1.5 billion won after 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. For two decades, the government and Chaebol largely ran Korean society as dominant actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Companies funded political campaigns and helped grow the economy, while the government granted privileges and imposed the costs of Chaebol excesses onto society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. An example of this was a bailout in 1971 when the Chaebol were over-leveraged; the government converted their private market loans to five-year public ones and froze private interest rates, negatively impacting small lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Growing Imbalance and Social Discontent

As Korea entered the 1980s, the military dictatorship's grip on power weakened, and the balance of power began to shift decisively in the Chaebol's favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. By the mid-1980s, the top five Chaebol accounted for nearly 20% of the country's GDP and 45% of its mining and manufacturing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This Chaebol-centric strategy suffocated South Korea's small and medium-sized business sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. From 1966 to 1976, while the number of manufacturing firms grew only 10%, their size exploded by 176% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. In contrast, Taiwan, which pursued a less cozy state-business relationship, saw its number of manufacturing firms grow by 150% and firm size by 29% over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

The vast imbalance between the Chaebol and the rest of the country became a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. As the people of South Korea became wealthier, they increasingly disapproved of the outsized power of these big business groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. They demanded more than just higher wages, seeking better environmental regulations, working conditions, and a better overall quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The government, becoming more democratic, had to shift from a stance of support to one of regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

However, political leaders remained reliant on the Chaebol's financial contributions to stay in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. After Park Chung-hee's assassination, Chun Doo-hwan's administration received 15 to 22 billion won from the Chaebol for political campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. The subsequent administration of President Roh Tae-woo received 21 to 25 billion won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This [[corruption_and_political_ties_in_south_korea | corrupt deal]] persisted partly due to the weakness of Korea's political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Even after democratization in 1987, the lack of established political campaigning norms and above-board financing systems left parties vulnerable to [[corruption_and_political_ties_in_south_korea | corruption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Consequently, the Chaebol continued to receive government aid in the form of plentiful capital, favorable regulations, and protection from competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Asian Financial Crisis and Subsequent Reforms

The [[political_and_financial_environment_in_south_korea | Asian Financial Crisis]] would expose the consequences of Korea's inability to control its big businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. In the decade following democratization in 1987, the Chaebol gained substantial political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. For instance, in 1988, [[history_and_rise_of_daewoo_group | Daewoo Group]] successfully lobbied the national assembly to amend the law to allow a government bailout for the struggling Daewoo Shipbuilding Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. They also pushed for rapid liberalization reforms to aid their growth, including easier access to foreign capital financing, which contributed to a massive debt boom culminating in the [[political_and_financial_environment_in_south_korea | Asian Financial Crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

Another reform allowed Chaebol to take limited ownership stakes in non-bank financial companies, leading to complicated cross-ownership structures that obscured their true size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. For example, the Lee family, controlling Samsung Group, could exercise operating control over almost all affiliated companies despite owning only a minority of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. These increasingly complex structures made it difficult to discern which subsidiaries were profitable and which were losing money, leading to profitable companies propping up weaker ones, causing market inefficiencies and oversupply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The crisis in 1997 significantly reduced the power of the Chaebol, opening the door for [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | reforms]] aimed at "common prosperity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Both the Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun administrations imposed various [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | reforms]] on the ailing Chaebol, with goals to prevent future financial crises by limiting debt capacity and cross-shareholder structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. These [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | reforms]] had wide-ranging consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. For instance, Hanjin Shipping was forced to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio below 200%, leading it to sell ships and lease others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The Korean car industry saw a drastic consolidation, from five independent companies in 1997 to essentially just Hyundai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. The Chaebol also reduced their affiliates and separated them further, with a sample showing 819 affiliates in 1997 dropping to 544 three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Dividends to minority shareholders, who had been stiffed by cross-holdings, significantly increased from 2.2 trillion won in 2001 to 10.8 trillion by 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Export Success and Deepening [[social_inequality_and_the_role_of_big_business_in_south_korea | Social Inequality]]

The crisis inadvertently helped create the Korean export juggernaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Recognizing the challenging domestic environment, the biggest Chaebol embraced free trade agreements in the 2000s and focused on overseas markets, achieving wild success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. By 2013, 86% of Samsung's revenue came from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This success drove the Korean economy's recovery, with an average growth rate of 5% from 1998 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

However, this impressive growth masked troubling [[social_inequality_and_the_role_of_big_business_in_south_korea | social issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. The benefits of this growth were concentrated among a small cohort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. By 2013, the Chaebol brought in over 50% of revenue and value-add in the manufacturing sector but employed less than 20% of its workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. As part of post-1997 [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | reforms]], the government allowed the Chaebol to lay off workers more easily to improve profitability and service debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Hundreds of thousands lost their jobs, many struggling to find regular salaried work since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Elder poverty in Korea has since reached four times the OECD average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, and the income share for the top 1% of Korean society rose from 7% before 1997 to 12% by the mid-2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This perceived [[social_inequality_and_the_role_of_big_business_in_south_korea | inequality]] led the Korean people to demand a change of direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## Political Responses and Ongoing Challenges

In 2007, President Lee Myung-bak, a former businessman and CEO of Hyundai Construction, won the presidency with a campaign emphasizing economic recovery after what he called a "lost decade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Despite the 5% annual GDP growth during that period, Lee promised a "747 promise" — 7% GDP growth, $40,000 per capita income, and making Korea the seventh-largest economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Lee's business policies indicated a belief that the previous decade had hindered the Chaebol's global competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. He lowered the corporate tax rate, raised the ceiling on non-bank financial investment, and amnestied convicted executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. He also continued market-oriented [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | reforms]], giving more decision-making power to industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. However, unlike Park Chung-hee, Lee did not force Chaebol to invest profits into new or risky industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. The Lee administration ultimately failed to deliver the promised growth, and GDP growth continued to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. In 2018, Lee was arrested on charges of bribery, embezzlement, and tax fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

In 2012, Park Geun-hye campaigned with a platform that combined nostalgia for the "glory years" with a stronger emphasis on welfare, though notably not advocating for a higher capital gains tax, which was key to the accelerating Korean wealth gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

Modern [[corruption_and_political_ties_in_south_korea | corruption]] by the Chaebol focuses on maximizing their wealth and market power through tax manipulations, legislation, and regulatory capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. The consequences of these actions became starkly apparent with the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking, which claimed 304 lives, mostly high school students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. While the ferry was old and overloaded, the most proximate reason for the high death rate was that safety and rescue regulations had been ignored for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. The regulatory agency and the ferry company had worked closely to overlook violations, maintaining a profitable status quo that included the "revolving door" of government employees entering the industry and the ferry company's monopoly on the lucrative Incheon-Jeju route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

South Korea's struggle with its largest companies continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. Park Geun-hye's administration ended in [[corruption_and_political_ties_in_south_korea | corruption]] scandals and impeachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Her successor, President Moon Jae-in, implemented business [[reforms_and_challenges_in_south_koreas_economic_landscape | reforms]] and higher tax rates, which seemed to improve public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. However, the South Korean economy is heavily dependent on its handful of powerful global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Substantial reform risks weakening their competitive position in the global marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. Chaebol reform remains a furiously debated and highly polarized issue in South Korean presidential politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

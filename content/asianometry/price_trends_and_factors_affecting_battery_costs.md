In 2024, lithium-ion battery pack prices experienced a significant drop, falling 20% to $115 per kilowatt-hour, marking the largest price cut since 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This reduction has made purchasing Chinese batteries cheaper, even with tariffs of 25%, 35%, or potentially 120% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. A key driver of this trend is the price and technology developments within [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Once considered cheap and low-end due to fundamental chemistry weaknesses, LFP technology has been significantly advanced by [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Battery Chemistries and Cost Implications

Lithium-ion batteries consist of two electrodes: a cathode and an anode, with the anode typically being graphite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The cathode is the most expensive component, accounting for over 70% of a battery's value, and it defines the battery's chemistry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

There are three major chemistries in the industry:
*   **Ternary Batteries:** These include Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC) and Nickel Cobalt Aluminum (NCA), named for the three materials mixed in their cathodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. They offer higher energy densities, allowing for lighter battery packs and longer EV ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. However, they are more expensive due to the use of rarer materials like nickel and cobalt, which constitute 70% of raw material costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Higher energy densities also increase thermal risks, potentially leading to thermal runaway (fire) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. NCA ranges from 230-260 watt-hours per kilogram, while NMC is the highest at 250-320 watt-hours per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | **LFP Batteries**]]: These use an iron phosphate cathode, eliminating cobalt and nickel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Since iron and phosphorus are more common, LFPs have a significant cost advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. They also retain their initial energy capacity better over many charge cycles and have lower risks of thermal runaway due to their lower energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. LFPs typically range from 90 to 160 watt-hours per kilogram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LCO) Batteries:** These older chemistries used a high amount of cobalt (0.95 kg per kilogram-hour of energy capacity), primarily sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The unsustainable nature of this usage led to the traction of ternary chemistries, which used significantly less cobalt (e.g., NCA at 0.14 kg, NMC at 0.4 kg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

In essence, batteries involve a trade-off between performance (energy density), cost, and safety. LFPs excel in cost and safety but have historically lagged in performance, while NMC and NCA offer performance at higher costs and safety risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Historical Context: China's Role in LFP Development

In the early 2010s, while Western EV pioneers like Chevrolet, Nissan, and Tesla utilized ternary battery chemistries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | China's first EV makers]] adopted LFPs for their new energy vehicles, particularly buses <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This was influenced by early government industrial policies like the "Thousands of Vehicles, Tens of Cities" (TVTC) policy, launched in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. TVTC provided subsidies to municipal governments to purchase public service fleets, aiming to address urban air pollution, energy security, and foster Chinese EV development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

Companies like BYD became early pioneers in LFP due to its cost and safety advantages, leading to LFP chemistries dominating the Chinese EV industry for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

However, in late 2016, the Chinese government shifted its subsidy policies to encourage the production of more consumer-attractive EVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Subsidies became linked to factors like higher energy density, longer driving ranges, and faster charging rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This policy favored ternary battery chemistries, which could achieve higher energy densities and unlock larger subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Consequently, even LFP loyalists like BYD adopted ternary batteries for their models by 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. By mid-2019, ternary batteries held about 70% of installed capacity, while LFP's market share dropped to 30% or lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Factors Revitalizing LFP and Driving Down Costs

Two major developments reversed this trend and revitalized LFP batteries:

### 1. Withdrawal of Subsidies

Starting in June 2019, the Chinese government began a gradual withdrawal of EV cash subsidy policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. While expected, the scale and schedule of the withdrawal surprised the industry, with a 50% reduction in mid-2019 followed by further cuts in subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This aggressive sunsetting leveled the cost playing field, prompting EV makers to switch back to LFP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### 2. Manufacturing Innovations

Simultaneously, LFP makers introduced new technologies to address their fundamental weaknesses:

*   **BYD Blade Battery and Cell-to-Pack (CTP):** In March 2020, BYD introduced the Blade battery, debuting in their Han sedan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Traditional EV battery manufacturing involves three levels: cells, modules, and packs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. BYD's Blade battery entirely skipped the module stage, integrating prismatic cells directly into the battery pack (Cell-to-Pack or CTP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This innovation maximized the pack's volume to compensate for LFP's lower energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. The Blade battery, named for its long, ultra-thin prismatic cell shape that spans the width of the pack, was a game-changer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. The 2020 Han EV with the Extended Range Blade battery achieved a range of 605 kilometers (NEDC), comparable to premium ternary battery EVs but at a significantly lower cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. CTP gives LFP battery packs about 85% of a conventional NMC battery's energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Other Chinese battery makers, like CATL with their Qilin battery pack, soon adopted CTP technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. By 2023, LFPs accounted for nearly 70% of EV installations in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **New LFP Production Methods:** To further differentiate and improve performance, LFP makers are exploring new methods:
    *   **LMFP (Lithium Manganese Iron Phosphate):** Adding manganese to LFP increases energy density <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
    *   **"Double Firing" (二烧) Process:** This method involves partially firing cathode precursors at a lower temperature, then milling and carbon coating them before a second firing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This results in more uniform particles and better conductivity, leading to improved, consistent performance ideal for long-range, fast-charging EVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

### 3. [[the_influence_of_patents_on_lfp_battery_development | Patent Expiration]]

A crucial factor was the expiration of key patents related to LFP technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. While the original LFP cathode was pioneered by Dr. John Goodenough, it faced commercial challenges due to poor electrical conductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Later innovations in carbon coating and process technologies, patented by researchers in Canada and Europe, made LFP commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

An agreement in the 2000s or 2010s allowed Chinese battery makers to use these LFP battery patents for free within their local markets, while others had to pay licensing fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. This "patent shield" allowed [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | China]] to extensively develop [[lithium_iron_phosphate_lfp_battery_chemistry_and_technology | LFP proficiency]] and build immense supply chain expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. When these patents finally expired in 2022, foreign battery makers could access the technology without licensing fees, but they were significantly behind in [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | LFP supply chain proficiency]], [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage | cell-to-pack innovations]], economies of scale, and talent pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

### 4. Competition

Until 2021, BYD practiced vertical integration, only producing batteries for its own cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. However, in 2021, BYD began selling its Blade batteries to third parties like Toyota and Ford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. This introduced a major new Tier 1 battery supplier, triggering a price war in an already highly competitive Chinese EV market, where a new EV model is reportedly launched every two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

## Raw Materials Price Crash

A significant factor in the lithium-ion battery price crash after 2022 was a concurrent crash in raw materials prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Raw materials account for 70-80% of a battery cell's cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. For LFP, iron phosphate and lithium alone make up 80% of the material cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

*   **Lithium:** New lithium sources came online in Australia, Chile, and Argentina in 2023, rapidly reversing a 2022 lithium shortage and causing prices to crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Iron Ore:** Iron prices also reversed from their 2022 highs due to [[chinas_role_and_strategies_in_the_lfp_battery_market | China's]] real estate crisis, which mothballed crude steel production and caused iron ore prices to fall 15% in 2024 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

These material cost reductions enable Chinese EV battery makers to cut battery prices while remaining profitable, despite the intense competitive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. For example, CATL's revenues declined in 2024, but their gross profit margins rose from 19.2% to 24.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

## Spillover Effects: Utility-Scale Energy Storage

The crashing prices of LFP batteries have had significant [[impact_of_battery_technology_on_electric_vehicles_and_energy_storage | spillover effects]] beyond EVs into other industries, particularly utility-scale stationary energy storage systems, or Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

LFP batteries were already favored for BESS due to their cheaper material costs and resistance to thermal runaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. The Chinese EV boom after 2021 has further propelled BESS adoption, making alternative storage methods like "power to gas" uncompetitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. While BESS may not match pumped storage in sheer capacity (providing 1-2 hours of power versus 4-12 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>, they are incredibly cheap and simple to build, often housed in standard-sized containers for easy deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. Billions of dollars are being invested in BESS projects across the United States, particularly in California and Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Chinese EV and stationary battery industries continue to drive forward, with market analysts expecting LFP prices to keep falling, albeit at a slower pace than in previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

Looking ahead, [[materials_and_technologies_in_sodiumion_battery_development | sodium-ion battery technology]] is an interesting development to watch, with companies like CATL, BYD, and Huawei pursuing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. While [[comparison_of_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] currently suffer from fundamental energy density shortcomings compared to lithium-ion, sodium is far more accessible than lithium, appears to charge faster, and its energy density numbers are improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. The question remains whether sodium-ion will be as impactful, given the highly optimized LFP supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

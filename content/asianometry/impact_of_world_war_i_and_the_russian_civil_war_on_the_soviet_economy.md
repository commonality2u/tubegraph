The [[rise_and_decline_of_the_Soviet_economy | rise and decline of the Soviet economy]] is a complex topic, influenced significantly by the early 20th-century conflicts that reshaped the Russian Empire into the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

## The Russian Empire on the Eve of War

In 1913, the Russian Empire was the world's largest country by landmass and ranked third globally in population, following China and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>. Despite its size, most of its population was poor and agrarian, reflecting the global average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:12">[01:36:12]</a>. Incomes were comparable to those in Japan and Latin America, surpassing levels in Africa, India, and China, but significantly lagging behind the rest of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:17">[01:40:17]</a>.

## World War I and its Economic Devastation

World War I emerged as an "all-consuming total war" that severely strained even Europe's wealthiest empires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:09">[01:49:09]</a>. Nations like the United Kingdom, France, and Germany dedicated significant portions of their GDP to the war effort, spending 40%, 50%, and 60% respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:21">[01:54:21]</a>. Governments extensively intervened to control resources and output, ensuring supplies for the war effort, a system described as a precursor to the "command economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:07">[02:01:07]</a>.

The war devastated the Russian Empire, causing its national income to plummet by 80% from pre-war levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:15">[02:15:15]</a>. The government faced immense challenges in feeding its 9 million soldiers, as the drafting of men and horses diverted essential labor from farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:06">[02:20:06]</a>. Widespread shortages compelled Russia to borrow foreign currency and print money to import necessary supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:16">[02:29:16]</a>. This imbalance between real production and a growing money supply led to [[hyperinflation_and_economic_challenges_during_the_soviet_war_communism | inflation]], which reached 6% per month between 1916 and 1917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:13">[02:34:13]</a>. By the time of the Bolshevik takeover in 1917, Russia's economic situation, while dire, was not notably worse than that of other nations embroiled in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:06">[02:49:06]</a>.

## The Russian Civil War and its Lasting Scars

Following the Bolshevik assumption of power in 1917, the new government attempted to establish a command economy in line with their ideological goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:15">[03:00:15]</a>. This included the confiscation of surplus food, nationalization of industry, and seizure of Church and aristocratic estates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:16">[03:04:16]</a>.

However, in the latter half of 1918, anti-revolutionary forces, known as the Whites, launched an uprising against the Bolshevik government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:17">[03:13:17]</a>. The ensuing Russian Civil War, exacerbated by foreign interventions on both sides, lasted over five years and resulted in millions of deaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.

This brutal conflict, coming so soon after World War I, annihilated crucial infrastructure, transportation networks, and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. National incomes plummeted to pre-modern levels, estimated at around $600 in contemporary dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>. The period was marked by widespread famine and governmental failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. The [[economic_impact_of_war_and_revolution_on_the_soviet_union | economic impact of war and revolution on the Soviet Union]] left the country in a state of severe disarray.

## The New Economic Policy (NEP) and Recovery

In 1921, Lenin introduced the New Economic Policy (NEP) as a measure to restore farmers' incentives to produce agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This policy shifted from seizing all surplus goods to implementing a progressive tax, essentially stepping back from the immediate attempt to create a full command economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

While the initial implementation of the NEP was bumpy, marked by another harvest failure and famine, the policy eventually spurred recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. After a year, farms resumed production, and small businesses and markets began to emerge in the countryside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. The economy gradually began to recover from the devastating effects of the Great War and the Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

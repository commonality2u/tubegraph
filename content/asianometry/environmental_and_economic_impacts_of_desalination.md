[[Desalination Technologies and Processes | Desalination]] plays a critical role in addressing water scarcity, particularly in regions like the Gulf, where over 65% of the world's desalination water capacity is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While vital, these processes carry significant [[Environmental Impact and Safety of Nuclear Desalination | environmental]] and [[Economic Considerations of Desalination | economic costs]].

## Economic Considerations
[[Economic Considerations of Desalination | Desalination plants]] represent substantial investments and require significant energy input, impacting their overall economic viability.

### High Capital and Operating Costs
Mega-scale [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | desalination]] complexes involve enormous capital outlays. For instance, Saudi Arabia's Ras Al Khair desalination complex, a power and water cogeneration plant, cost over $7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

Energy consumption is the single most significant cost factor for water [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | desalination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>.

*   **Thermal Desalination (MSF)**: Multi-Stage Flash (MSF) plants, dominant in the Gulf region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>, are massively energy-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. Estimates for producing one cubic meter of desalted water range from 10 to 25 kilowatt-hours or higher, primarily consumed as heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.
    *   Pairing a [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | desalination plant]] with an existing power station and utilizing its byproduct heat can cut energy consumption by approximately 50% compared to a single-purpose plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.
    *   Despite this, energy requirements can be daunting; in 2014, Saudi Arabia's cogeneration plants consumed 1.5 million barrels of oil daily, accounting for 15% of its oil production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. The economic viability of these large MSF plants is often dependent on the [[Energy Sources for Desalination | GCC countries']] extensive energy reserves and generous subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
*   **Reverse Osmosis (SWRO)**: Seawater Reverse Osmosis (SWRO) is a less energy-intensive method, requiring about 4 to 5 kilowatt-hours per cubic meter of water, roughly one-third to one-quarter that of MSF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. This lower energy demand has led to SWRO dominating the global market share, with over 60% of installed capacity, compared to MSF's less than 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.
    *   However, SWRO requires extensive pre-treatment of seawater to prevent membrane fouling, which can add up to 25% to the final cost of desalted water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.

### Infrastructure and Legacy
Despite the advantages of SWRO, MSF methods continue to dominate in the Gulf region due to billions of dollars already invested in these installations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. While Saudi Arabia is exploring more RO-only and hybrid RO-thermal systems, such as the Shuqaiq 3 plant which cost $600 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>, the transition away from MSF is gradual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.

### Brine Disposal Costs
Brine disposal is another significant cost factor, potentially adding between 5-30% to the final cost of freshwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>. While extracting and selling salt from brine is possible, it is not yet economically viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>.

## Environmental Impacts
Both thermal and membrane [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | desalination processes]] generate highly concentrated brine, posing substantial [[Environmental Impact and Safety of Nuclear Desalination | environmental risks]].

### Brine Discharge
For every two cubic meters of freshwater produced, one cubic meter of brine is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. This brine is typically very hot and 40% to 80% saltier than seawater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:58:00">[14:58:00]</a>. It often contains other substances such as heavy metals, acids, chlorine, and anti-scalant chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>.

*   **Impact on Ecosystems**: Dumping brine at the shoreline or deep underwater can harm local ecosystems, even with substantial dilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>. The anti-scalant chemicals added to MSF plants, while preventing salt scaling, have consequences for brine disposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.
*   **Groundwater Contamination**: Burying brine underground risks fouling groundwater resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.

### Centralization and Vulnerability
The intense centralization of water systems in GCC countries, with 50% of Saudi Arabia's [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | desalination]] capacity in just five plants and 60% of the UAE's in four <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>, is not only uneconomical and environmentally dangerous, but also a national security threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>. A shift towards SWRO can encourage decentralization, bringing water supplies closer to consumers, which is beneficial for communities, nations, and the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.

While [[Desalination Technologies and Processes | desalination]] is an impractical necessity for water-stressed regions that consume 8 to 30 times the amount of freshwater they naturally possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>, the associated environmental and economic challenges will continue to worsen as water demands expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:52:00">[15:52:00]</a>.

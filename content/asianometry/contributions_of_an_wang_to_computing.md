[[history_and_rise_of_wang_labs | The story of Wang Labs]] begins and ends with the singular genius of its founder, An Wang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. An incredible engineer and brilliant businessman, Wang Labs rose on the back of his ability to create the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Early Life and Education
An Wang was born in Shanghai in 1920 to an upper-middle-class family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Despite starting schooling two years younger than his classmates, he excelled brilliantly in math and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. His unusual but quiet confidence in his abilities would drive him throughout his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. At age 16, Wang won a scholarship to Chaotong University, then considered China's MIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. He graduated first in his class in 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

In 1945, Wang arrived in the United States and entered Harvard to study Applied Physics, finding the work easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. He received a PhD in just 13 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Innovation in Data Storage: Magnetic Core Memory
After earning his PhD, Wang joined the Harvard Computation Lab, working on the Mark 1, one of the world's most powerful computers at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. He pondered the problem of storing and reading large amounts of information without clumsy mechanical steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. Existing methods using magnetic tapes demagnetized the tape upon reading, destroying the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

Wang realized that destroying information during reading didn't matter if it could be rewritten immediately afterward without sacrificing speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. This concept was incorporated into magnetic core memory, or core memory, which became the successor to the magnetic drum and the ancestor of RAM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. In 1949, Wang applied for a patent for this concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Though Harvard did not reserve patent rights for such inventions at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>, his application angered colleagues who believed such knowledge should be public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

## Founding Wang Laboratories and Early Products
In 1950, as Harvard began moving away from fields with commercial applications like computers, Wang decided to strike out on his own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. Despite challenges like racism, difficulties with English, and lack of money, he possessed unshakable confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. Wang Laboratories was founded on June 30, 1951, with just $600 in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. Wang began by producing and selling core memories for about $4 each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

In 1952, he approached IBM about licensing his pending patent on core memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. In 1955, IBM paid Wang between $400,000 and $500,000 (roughly $4.4 to $5.5 million today) for his patent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. This money freed Wang to shift from consulting toward developing products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

## Calculator Innovations
In the early 1960s, Wang partnered with Compugraphic to design and produce the Linasec, a machine that justified lines of text for publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. This collaboration highlighted the need for full control over product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

Wang's first fully controlled hit came in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. The calculator industry was moving from mechanical to solid-state electronics, and Wang aimed to produce a calculator as capable as a mainframe but much smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.

### LOCI (Logarithmic Calculating Instrument)
Wang and a colleague developed a patented transistor logic that could derive the natural logarithmic value of any number using just six pre-stored natural logarithmic values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. This innovation led to the **LOCI**, debuting in January 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. The LOCI was small and powerful, capable of advanced logarithms using fewer than 300 logic transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.

### Wang 300 Calculator
Recognizing the LOCI's difficulty of use, Wang developed the **Wang 300 calculator**, introduced in 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. The 300 was easy to use and more affordable, becoming an immediate hit with scientists, researchers, stockbrokers, and insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. It gained legendary status for revealing a calculation error in a bond trading table that had been in use for three decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

## Transition to Computers and Word Processing
By 1971, Wang made the strategic decision to pull out of the calculator market, anticipating that microprocessors would drive prices down significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. He believed the future was in computers and pursued a two-pronged strategy: general-purpose computers and word processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>.

### Wang 3300 BASIC and 2200 Computer
The **Wang 3300 BASIC**, a general-purpose computer, reached the market in 1970 but was not successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>. Its successor, the **Wang 2200**, released in May 1973, proved to be a capable small business computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>. The 2200 used BASIC for easy programmability and stored program information on Intel's ROM chips, enabling instant wake capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:00">[16:19:00]</a>. It sold extremely well for a decade and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>.

### Wang Word Processing System (WPS)
The first word processing product, the Wang 1200, faced reliability issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>. Learning from this, Wang tasked Harold Koplow and David Morris in 1975 to redesign the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>. The resulting **Wang Word Processing System (WPS)**, introduced in 1976, was a powerful, upgradable, and radically easy-to-use system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>. It utilized a network of machines, each with its own Intel 8080 microprocessor, capable of independent work while sharing texts or sending documents to a central storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. Critically, it ditched IBM's Selectric typewriter, relying instead on a CRT screen to display words, and simplified user interaction with built-in prompts and a menu system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>. The WPS was an immediate hit, leading to massive growth for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>.

### VS Minicomputer
In 1977, Wang introduced its third major product, the **VS minicomputer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>. Smaller and cheaper than IBM's mainframes, it was powerful enough to run commercial applications like spreadsheets without requiring a large team of technicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>. Competing against Digital Equipment Corporation's VAX line, the VS held its own, modeled after an IBM 360 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>. These three products, the 2200, WPS, and VS, generated billions in revenue for Wang Laboratories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>.

## [[legacy_and_impact_of_an_wang_and_wang_labs | Legacy and Impact]]
By the late 1970s, Wang Laboratories was the world's largest supplier of CRT-based word processing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>. Under An Wang's leadership, the company aggressively advertised to position itself as a leading computer maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>. Sales reached $1 billion in 1982 and $2 billion in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a>.

Wang's technological vision and business acumen were instrumental in the company's rise. He was intimately involved in crafting Wang's most successful products, spending an estimated 65% of his time on product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>. He was not only incredibly technical but also an extraordinary manager of the company's sprawling R&D operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:00">[21:00:00]</a>.

However, An Wang's resistance to the personal computer (PC) revolution proved to be a critical misstep, as he viewed it as a "future dead end commodity" like the calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>. This decision, along with internal management challenges, contributed to [[the_decline_and_fall_of_wang_labs | Wang Labs' decline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:00">[24:28:00]</a>. Wang passed away in 1990, and Wang Laboratories entered bankruptcy in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>. Despite the eventual decline of his company, An Wang's contributions to computing, particularly in data storage and word processing systems, left a significant mark on the industry.

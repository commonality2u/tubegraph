From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence|Daewoo Group]] reached its peak as Korea's fourth-largest business conglomerate, alongside Hyundai, Samsung, and LG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Its rapid ascent was fueled by a favorable [[political_and_financial_environment_in_south_korea|political environment]] and significant debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. However, within a two-year period, the entire group disintegrated due to its overwhelming liabilities, a severe recession, and widespread fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The collapse of Daewoo severely tarnished the legacy of its founder and chairman, Kim Woo-Choong, who had to flee the country until he received a pardon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Founding and Early Success

Kim Woo-Choong, born in 1936, was the fourth of six children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. His father, a school principal and later governor of Jeju Island, was abducted during the Korean War and never returned, leaving the family to fend for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. After the war, Kim Woo-Choong moved to Seoul and studied economics at Yonsei University, graduating in 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. He then worked for six years at a relative's textile trade and export company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

In 1967, at age 30, Kim founded his own textiles trading company, Daewoo Industrial, starting with just $18,000 and four employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The name "Daewoo" literally means "great universe," symbolizing Kim's grand ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Textile Gambit

In 1970, Kim persuaded major American department stores like Sears, JCPenney, and Montgomery Ward to sell his textiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. A crucial turning point came when his American customers informed him of the U.S. government's plan to impose textile import quotas, with foreign suppliers receiving a percentage based on current market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Daewoo made a "ballsy gambit," sacrificing both profits and product quality to gain as much market share as possible before the quota was imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This strategy paid off: in 1972, Daewoo was awarded 30% of the quota, instantly propelling the company forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. By its fourth year, Daewoo exported over $4 million in textile goods, becoming Korea's second-largest exporter and securing the cash flow for future expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Rapid Expansion and Business Strategy

During the 1960s, President Park Chung-hee's administration focused on building exports and capacity in strategic industries, offering favorable loans and funding to companies that aligned with this vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Daewoo was one such company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

In 1973, Daewoo expanded into diverse new industries, including machinery, shipbuilding, construction, and automobiles, primarily through acquisitions and joint ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The company excelled at turnarounds, demonstrating relentless perseverance and an appetite for risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. For example, Daewoo acquired the struggling Hankook Machinery in 1976, renamed it Daewoo Heavy Industries, and saw it turn a profit in its second year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Similarly, the acquisition of Okpo Shipbuilding in 1978 led to profitability five years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

Daewoo's business playbook, derived from its textile success, focused on market share over profits, with high volume and low prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. They rarely prioritized upgrading technologies or moving into more valuable market segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Aligned with government preferences, Daewoo heavily focused on exports, with Kim Woo-Choong traveling extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Their goods were primarily sold in emerging countries in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Government Ties and Debt Accumulation

Daewoo's rapid rise was inextricably linked to its strong relationship with the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Founder Kim Woo-Choong had personal ties to Park Chung-hee (Kim's father was Park's primary school principal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The company also regularly hired government elites and retired state bankers for executive positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

These close ties allowed Daewoo to secure "absurdly favorable loans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. While annual inflation reached 40% and private banks charged high interest rates, Daewoo's loans were in the 6-9% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. In return for these preferential loans, monopoly protections, favorable labor laws, and silent backing, the [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence|chaebol]] contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to presidential slush funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

Publicly, Chairman Kim was lauded as a world-famous businessman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. He was profiled in international magazines and elected chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. His 1989 autobiography, *Every Street is Paved with Gold*, became a bestseller, selling over 2 million copies and translated into 21 languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Ownership Structure and Control

Initially, Daewoo's core holding company was privately owned by the founder and his family, a common practice for many Korean [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence|chaebol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. In the 1970s, the Korean government mandated that [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence|chaebol]] take their holding companies public to provide liquidity to the stock markets and allow the public to participate in economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

To maintain control despite public offerings, the family established a complex cross-ownership structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. By 1997, Kim and his family owned, on average, only 6.1% of shares in Daewoo Group companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. However, with subsidiaries owning about 30% of each other, Kim controlled an average of 38.3% of the votes, making him unchallengeable, even as his decision-making became erratic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This complicated structure and interlocking dependencies (Daewoo companies primarily used each other's services) made it difficult to determine profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, a problem often ignored due to the expectation of government bailouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Entry into the Car Business and Shifting Tides

By 1979, Daewoo Group owned 41 companies and was South Korea's largest exporter, just 12 years after its founding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. That year marked two significant events:

1.  **Entry into the Car Business:** In 1978, Daewoo partnered with GM Korea to acquire 50% of Sehan Motor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. By 1992, they acquired full control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Daewoo Motors applied the same playbook as its other products: low prices and low quality, with minimal focus on R&D and technical upgrading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This strategy strained the company's finances due to cut-throat pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
2.  **Assassination of Park Chung-hee:** The president's death in 1979 led to major shifts in Korea's regulatory and economic climate, putting Daewoo on unstable ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Subsequent governments opened markets to foreign competition, and cheap government loans began to dry up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

The 1980s introduced new challenges for Daewoo's low-price, low-quality strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>:
*   The South Korean Won appreciated, making exports more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   South Korean labor wages rose, making cheap goods production less viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   Countries adopted protective trade barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   China began opening up, with its exporters adopting similar low-cost strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

Despite recognizing the need to adapt and attempts to improve product quality and R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>, these initiatives never gained traction due to a "moral hazard" mindset stemming from past bailouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

## Near-Bankruptcy and The 1989 Bailout

In 1988, Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery, carrying $1.8 billion in debt, suffered a near-bankruptcy event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Daewoo sought a government bailout, arguing they took on the shipyard at Park Chung-hee's request and that the Korea Development Bank had not provided promised equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Shipyard employees also expected a bailout, negotiating significant wage increases even amidst struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

The government ultimately bailed out Daewoo Shipbuilding in 1989, providing 200 billion Korean Won in preferential loans and injecting another 50 billion Won directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This generous rescue reaffirmed Daewoo's close government ties, even after Park's assassination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Automotive Obsession and Mounting Debts

Despite the bailout, Kim Woo-Choong reverted to his "most intoxicating and costly obsession" — cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. In 1992, Daewoo Group acquired full control of its motor subsidiary, which was unprofitable, losing $200 million that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Nevertheless, Daewoo Motors embarked on a massive buying spree to become a global automotive leader, likely using funds from the 1989 shipbuilding bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

Between 1994 and 1996, Daewoo Motors acquired a technical center in the UK, started a joint venture in Romania, spent $1.8 billion on a Polish car company and truck factory, and opened an $800 million car plant in Uzbekistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. They also bought a Czech truck manufacturer and entered Ukraine and India via joint ventures, totaling 14 car factory purchases in 13 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Many of these ventures failed (e.g., losing $30 million annually in India, selling only 423 cars in Vietnam in 1998) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. In January 1998, at the peak of the Asian Financial Crisis, Daewoo took a majority stake in the troubled Ssangyong Motor company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

### Structural Vulnerability

Like all [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence|chaebol]], Daewoo relied heavily on debt, with an average debt-to-equity ratio of 400% throughout the 1980s and 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. However, Daewoo carried the most debt, over $11 billion into the 1990s, and was uniquely vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Unlike other [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence|chaebol]] structured around a cash-cow core company (like Samsung Electronics), Daewoo's core company, Daewoo Corporation, was a trading and financial entity that prioritized revenues over profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. It funded its subsidiaries through borrowings, leaving the entire group on "thin ice" without a profitable anchor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

The market had long suspected issues; in April 1997, on the eve of the Asian Financial Crisis, Daewoo had the lowest price-to-book ratio among Korea's top [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence|chaebol]] (1.12, compared to Samsung's 6 and Hyundai's 3.66) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

## The Final Collapse

The [[political_and_financial_environment in_south_korea|Asian Financial Crisis]], beginning in 1997, triggered a two-year chain of events that led to Daewoo's insolvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. The Korean Won plunged from 901 to 1961 against the U.S. dollar, and Korea received a controversial international bailout, with the economy shrinking nearly 7% the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

While other [[south_koreas_chaebol_and_economic_influence|chaebol]] pulled back, Daewoo recklessly plunged ahead, continuing its strategy of discounting products and acquiring new companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. This included the acquisition of Ssangyong Motor in January 1998, adding further debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Throughout 1998, Daewoo raised another $14.1 billion despite considerable existing debts, becoming the nation's single most indebted company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Investors likely believed the government would eventually intervene with another bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

Daewoo had been in discussions with the government since June 1998, but Chairman Kim resisted austerity measures, as he was an "empire builder" unwilling to accept shrinkage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. In late 1998, the Korean government, realizing the contagion risk of a Daewoo debt default, instructed financial institutions to limit their holdings in Daewoo group debt to 5% of their portfolio, effectively cutting off Daewoo's credit lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Without new borrowings, the company could not stay afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

In December 1998, Daewoo finally agreed to downsize, consolidating 51 operating companies into 10 and aiming to reduce its debt ratio from 500% over 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. However, this "restructuring" lacked teeth; creditor banks failed to withdraw funding when Daewoo missed quarterly debt reduction targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. Rumors of last-minute saviors, such as a Daewoo-Samsung Motors swap or a Saudi prince, helped maintain a delusion that Daewoo would survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

### Accounting Fraud

By mid-1999, it became clear that Daewoo was heading towards default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. In reality, Daewoo was already bankrupt by the end of 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Despite reporting 25% higher sales and a half-trillion Korean Won profit loss for 1998, management claimed the loss was due to one-off situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. However, these reported profits were generated through a massive scheme of fictitious overseas asset sales between sister subsidiaries at inflated prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. For example, subsidiary A would "sell" an asset like a tractor to subsidiary B at an absurd price, with B paying in stock or another asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. This allowed A to record false profits and revalue all its other similar assets to the new, inflated price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

Removing these fraudulent practices revealed that Daewoo's true loss was not half a trillion Won, but four trillion Won—eight times higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. Other estimates suggest the fraud in 1997 and 1998 was as high as 23 trillion Won (about $19 billion), making it Korea's largest accounting fraud at that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. Regardless of the exact scale, Daewoo was undeniably insolvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

## Aftermath and Legacy

In July 1999, Kim Woo-Choong made a final, "ballsy gambit," publicly offering his personal wealth as collateral and resigning all positions except Daewoo Motors, promising to make it profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. In return, he requested creditors inject another 4 trillion Won ($3.4 billion), while Daewoo would find another $9 billion in collateral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

On August 1999, Kim was removed from his companies, and the subsidiaries were placed into bankruptcy to be sold off in chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. At its end, Daewoo owed over $50 billion in debt to 140 banks in more than 100 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.

Kim fled the country in November 1999 and lived in exile for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. Upon his return, he was put on trial, received a large fine, and a ten-year prison sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. Less than a year later, he received a presidential pardon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. He died in 2019 at the age of 82 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

The [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices|collapse of Daewoo]] had significant repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>:
*   Banks and insurance companies lost trillions of Won from Daewoo debt, requiring the Korean government to inject public money to prevent their collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.
*   It led to extensive [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices|reforms]] in investor transparency and banking oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>.
*   Accountants who failed to sound alarms received fines and had their licenses suspended, leading to [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices|reforms in the Korean accounting industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.
*   Between $750 million and $4 billion remains missing from the company's coffers, possibly used for personal expenses (e.g., a $2.5 million donation to Harvard for Kim's son) or government bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

Today, the former Daewoo companies operate independently, though some still bear the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. Few companies have grown as fast as Daewoo, and hopefully, few will implode as spectacularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>.

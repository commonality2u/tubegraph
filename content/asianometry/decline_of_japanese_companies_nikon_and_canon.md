In the mid-1990s, two Japanese companies, Nikon and Canon, dominated the photolithography market, together holding a three-quarter share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. However, a Dutch company named ASML rose to overtake them, relegating them to minor players in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Today, Nikon and Canon no longer compete at the cutting edge, while ASML has become Europe's most valuable technology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## What is Photolithography?

A photolithography stepper or scanner acts as a nanoscale printer, transferring integrated circuit patterns onto a wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. A single wafer can contain hundreds of dies, which are the components found in chips like Apple's M1 or A13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The process involves several steps:
1.  **Coating**: A silicon wafer is coated with a chemical called a photoresist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  **Projection**: The stepper or scanner projects the integrated circuit design onto the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
3.  **Etching**: Areas not exposed by the baked photoresist are etched away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
This process repeats to achieve the desired level of sophistication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While not the only machine used, the photolithography machine is one of the most critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## The Rise of Japanese Dominance

During the 1960s and 1970s, the United States, primarily through companies like Perkin Elmer and Geophysics Corporation of America (GCA), dominated the photolithography tools market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This alarmed the Japanese government, particularly the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which reorganized the country's computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. MITI compelled Japan's top optical manufacturers to catch up to the American leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This initiative became known as the VLSI research project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

By 1980, Nikon introduced its first commercial stepper, swiftly followed by Canon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Their products offered superior performance at lower prices, enabling the two Japanese companies to overthrow American dominance and rule the market in less than a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. At this point, Japan's technical lead in lithography tools seemed insurmountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## ASML's Emergence and Ascent

ASML was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between Dutch firms ASM International and Philips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The semiconductor supplier industry faced significant challenges during this period of economic volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. ASML incurred losses for its first six years, leading ASM to sell its shares to Philips and two banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. In 1990, ASML became an independent company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, though it maintained strong ties with Philips, which remained a major shareholder and was located nearby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This backing from Philips, alongside Carl Zeiss, helped ASML persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

By its IPO in 1995, ASML had secured 25% of the market share, tying with Canon for third place and trailing Nikon's 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Three major industry events in the following years allowed ASML to seize market leadership from Canon and Nikon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Key Technological Breakthroughs

#### Twinscan System (2001)
In 2001, ASML released its first Twinscan system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This system processes wafers in two stages: a measurement stage and an exposure stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The measurement stage gathers information about the wafer's position, which is then used in the exposure stage where the wafer is exposed to ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This dual-wielding approach significantly increased wafer processing per hour but added substantial complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Nikon and Canon were unable to replicate this technology quickly enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. ASML rapidly iterated on its success, achieving 50% market share by 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

#### Immersion Lithography (2003)
The second breakthrough was a generational shift to immersion lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Previous techniques had an air gap between the wafer and the stepper; immersion lithography replaced this with water, shooting ultraviolet light through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Although this technique had been used in optical microscopes and appeared in textbooks, the industry largely overlooked it until Taiwanese scientist Burn Lin demonstrated its viability for reaching a 45-nanometer process node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. ASML was the first to commercialize it with the Twinscan AT1150i in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The Twinscan XT1700i, released three years later, became the first volume immersion product, cementing ASML's dominant position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

#### EUV Lithography
The semiconductor industry recognized that immersion lithography was a temporary solution, anticipating that current optical wavelengths would eventually be insufficient for printing next-generation semiconductors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. After debating options like particle-based and X-ray-based solutions, the industry ultimately chose EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) as the next-generation technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Major chipmakers collaborated with ASML to commercialize EUV, which required significant effort, as practical systems were delayed by a decade and went significantly over budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Canon "never had a chance" with EUV, and Nikon largely halted progress after 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This cemented the massive technical gap between ASML and its Japanese competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Theories Behind Japan's Decline

While ASML's innovations explain its rise, the reasons for Japan's significant decline are complex and multi-faceted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Software Capabilities
ASML's machines have become incredibly complex over the years, with a dramatic increase in CPUs and sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This hardware requires extensive software:
*   ASML's 1989 stepper, the PAS 5000, had 200 million lines of source code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   Their 2003 Twinscan had 1.25 billion lines, a six-fold growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   A single Twinscan contained 12.5 million lines of embedded device code to orchestrate its components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
ASML successfully managed this complexity, being one of the first companies to use Unified Modeling Language (UML) to visualize and develop software modules at an abstract level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. In contrast, Canon and Nikon were "never that great" at software and only recently began adopting these abstraction-heavy software practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### Loss of Core Market
Canon and Nikon's market share rise coincided with Japan's semiconductor industry gaining traction in the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. In the 1980s, Japanese companies like NEC, Mitsubishi Electric, Hitachi, and Toshiba dominated chipmaking, particularly memory, holding 90% of the 256k DRAM market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. These companies formed the core market for Canon and Nikon's lithography tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

However, in the 1990s, low-cost Japanese exports became a political issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Japanese companies had built massive overcapacity and dumped products overseas at below cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The American semiconductor industry successfully lobbied for limits on Japanese competitors, and this, combined with the appreciation of the yen, led Japan to pull back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. With this retreat, a significant portion of Nikon and Canon's business was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. While another Japanese semiconductor tool supplier, Tokyo Electron, largely succeeded in looking abroad for business, Nikon and Canon were not as successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This situation reflects a broader pattern of [[effects_of_international_competition_and_policies_on_japans_software_market | effects of international competition and policies on Japan's software market]] in other industries.

### Focus on Optics vs. System Optimization
Canon and Nikon began as optics systems companies, and while they developed their entire lithography tool stack, the core of their work always revolved around lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. As semiconductor engineering approached physical limits, engineers needed to find other avenues for gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. ASML, by outsourcing its optics R&D to Zeiss, was able to look beyond mere optics and optimize other aspects of their tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This resulted in a superior product that better met customer needs, for instance, by better utilizing new chemicals in photoresists and photomasks, and through innovations like the two-stage wafer swap process that led to the Twinscan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

### R&D and Industry Collaboration
Collaboration in R&D played a crucial role in ASML's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The ASML-Philips-Zeiss block benefited from close ties to IMEC, a semi-governmental non-profit in Belgium that works closely with industry and academia to develop new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. IMEC facilitates cross-industry collaboration, helping different companies within the semiconductor industry work together on new standards and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This exposure helped ASML understand how customers used their tools and how these tools interacted with equipment from other vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. ASML also demonstrated its collaborative nature through numerous joint papers published with chipmakers, toolmakers, and chemical makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

In contrast, Canon and Nikon lacked a similar collaborative body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. A review of Nikon's published papers showed that most were self-published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. While Japanese companies did exchange information with long-term partners, these exchanges were often limited, with customers only approaching toolmakers for serious problems, not for ideas on improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. It is notable that Nikon and Canon achieved their leading position in the 1980s partly due to a similar sharing of resources through the government-mandated VLSI project, which compelled competitors to work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. No equally effective collaborative framework has taken its place since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

The weakness in industry-academia ties in Japan also had direct consequences, notably affecting the immersion lithography breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. While Burn Lin discovered the theoretical pathway, the practical commercial system breakthroughs came from an American researcher at MIT who conducted experiments under industry-standard conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Such collaboration between researchers and industry professionals is less common in Japan, where industry professionals are wary of disclosing trade secrets, and university professors focus more on basic science without strong incentives for industrial application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. Japanese universities began reforming this in the mid-2000s, establishing technology licensing organizations similar to those at MIT, Stanford, and Berkeley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## Conclusion

ASML's rise was intertwined with the decline in competitiveness of the Japanese companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Nikon and Canon held the advantage but lost it, though the precise reasons remain complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. A key lesson is the importance of paying close attention during "generational shifts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Events like immersion and EUV represented moments when the industry's landscape shifted, transforming winners into losers and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

Despite the high-profile decline of Canon and Nikon, Japan's semiconductor industry still retains many "hidden industry champions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. These companies, with legacies and proficiencies built in earlier years, made the right decisions, adapted to new times, and survived the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. While less flashy than ASML or Applied Materials, they remain crucial to the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

Germany-based Carl Zeiss AG creates optics systems essential for multi-million dollar photolithography machines made by [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. These optics systems enable high-energy UV light to etch patterns as fine as a small virus onto wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Without Carl Zeiss's contributions, [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]] would not have machines for companies like TSMC, Samsung, or Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Carl Zeiss SMT, the semiconductor manufacturing division, is a joint venture where Carl Zeiss AG holds the majority share, and [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]] holds a 24.9% stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) Lithography

Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) lithography utilizes ultraviolet light rays in the 193 nanometer or 248 nanometer range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. DUV techniques currently power the majority of processed nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

Carl Zeiss has a long history with UV imaging:
*   The company has been constructing deep ultraviolet imaging systems for nearly 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   Carl Abbe, a physicist recruited by Carl Zeiss, first proposed the possibility of a microscope using ultraviolet light as early as 1874 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   By 1899, Carl Zeiss developed a quartz lens suitable for UV microscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   In the 1960s, the company leveraged its microscope techniques to build the first-ever lenses for microlithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Challenges and Innovations in DUV

Microlithography demands precise control of light distortions across a relatively large area to ensure accurate transfer of IC designs onto silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   A single lens proved insufficient, so Carl Zeiss combined multiple smaller lenses into massive optics systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   These systems often feature a "double bulge" or "funny looking bulge and waist structure" to reduce field curvature, an optical problem that prevents an entire frame from being in sharp focus simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Field curvature can lead to inaccuracies when projecting designs across large areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Carl Zeiss incorporated new techniques from its microscope work to accommodate industry changes and enhance the resolution of IC design projection onto wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Immersion Lithography

The early 2000s saw a breakthrough with immersion lithography, a technique allowing for improved resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   Traditional lithography techniques involved an air gap between the wafer and the stepper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   Immersion lithography replaces this air gap with water, through which ultraviolet light is directed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   First proposed and validated for semiconductor use by Taiwanese scientist Bern Lin, this technique enabled foundries to etch structures as small as 40 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   Carl Zeiss's leading products for this technique are the Starlith 1900 series, including the 1900i, which are among the company's top-selling products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The company invested over 450 million euros into a new factory and overcame significant engineering challenges to build these optics systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

## Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography

[[extreme_ultraviolet_lithography_and_its_challenges | Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUV)]] is the next advancement in the semiconductor fabrication roadmap, a disruptive technology used in cutting-edge process nodes today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   The use of a new wavelength in [[extreme_ultraviolet_lithography_and_its_challenges | EUV]] necessitated radical changes to the optics system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   A key challenge is that all available materials, including air, absorb high-energy UV light, rendering traditional lenses unusable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   Consequently, Carl Zeiss had to design an optics system composed entirely of multi-layer mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

### [[historical_context_and_industry_efforts_in_euv_advancement | Development of EUV Optics]]

Carl Zeiss initiated work on its [[extreme_ultraviolet_lithography_and_its_challenges | EUV]] optic system in 1995 with a micro exposure tool, a smaller version of the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   Collaborating with Lawrence Livermore National Lab and Berkeley Lab in California, the first prototype was delivered in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   The design was refined five times over the subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   In 2015, the Starlith 3100, the first full-field [[extreme_ultraviolet_lithography_and_its_challenges | EUV]] optic system, was delivered for [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | ASML]]'s ADT (Alpha Demo Tool) nxe 3100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

The Starlith is a multi-component system comprising:
1.  **Collector Optics**: Collects light from the [[euv_light_source_development_and_laserproduced_plasma | EUV light source]] and projects it through the aperture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
2.  **Aperture Illumination Optics**: Spreads out the light evenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
3.  **Reticle**: Contains the IC chip designs, off which the uniformly illuminated light reflects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
4.  **Projection Optics**: Finally projects the design onto the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

The Starlith 3100 established the core mechanics of the optical system, which were subsequently refined in later releases like the Starlith 3300 and 3400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Today, this technology forms a critical part of [[impact_of_euv_technology_on_semiconductor_fabrication | EUV-based process nodes]] at 7 nanometers or lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

Carl Zeiss's semiconductor division generated 1.8 billion euros in revenue in 2020, growing 12% year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. It contributes 30% of the group's business and holds critical strategic importance in German industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Unlike [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]]'s competitors, Japan-based Nikon and Canon, which make their own optics systems, the collaboration between [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]] and Carl Zeiss has proven more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. The complexity of these artisan optics systems makes it incredibly difficult for other companies to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

Data centers, which are essential for powering the digital world, have a significant impact on both water and energy resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The current artificial intelligence (AI) boom is leading to the construction of more large data centers globally, increasing their demand for these resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## [[water_consumption_in_data_centers | Water Consumption in Data Centers]]

A data center with 15 megawatts of IT capacity is estimated to use between 80 and 130 million gallons of water annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This amount of water is comparable to the annual consumption of three hospitals or two 18-hole golf courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Direct Water Use

Direct water use in data centers primarily occurs in [[cooling_systems_in_data_centers | cooling systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Almost all consumed electricity in a data center is converted into heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. To prevent long-term damage, electronic equipment must be kept cool, typically hard disk drives at around 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit) and solid-state chips at up to 85 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Most data centers use air cooling systems as part of a raised-floor setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Cold air from Computer Room Air Conditioners (CRACs) is directed into cold aisles, where it absorbs heat from servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This hot air then rises and is sent to fluid heat exchangers for transfer out of the room, often using a two-fluid loop system (process and condenser loops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Cooling towers are used to cool the water in the final loop by evaporation, where hot water flows down, and some evaporates, releasing energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Approximately 1% of the water evaporates for every 10 degrees Fahrenheit (5.6 degrees Celsius) of cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This evaporated water must be replaced with new, make-up water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Indirect Water Use (Energy Generation)

The indirect water use by data centers, primarily for power generation, is often much larger than direct consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Water is withdrawn to generate certain types of power, particularly thermoelectric sources like coal, natural gas, or nuclear, which boil water to spin turbines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. In 2021, 73% of the US's power came from thermoelectric means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Studies suggest that water usage for energy generation can be 2-3 times greater than that consumed directly by cooling systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## [[energy_efficiency_in_data_centers | Energy Efficiency in Data Centers]]

In 2022, data centers accounted for about 1% to 1.3% of the world's electricity consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The ongoing AI boom is projected to propel data center energy consumption to 4.5% of global energy generation by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

Data center [[energy_efficiency_in_data_centers | energy efficiency]] is measured by Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), calculated by dividing the total energy delivered by the total energy going to the ICT equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. A PUE of 1.0 indicates 100% efficiency, meaning all energy goes to ICT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Larger data centers generally have lower PUEs; hyperscale facilities from Google and Microsoft claim PUEs of 1.1 or 1.2, while smaller "closet data centers" might have PUEs around 2.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This difference is largely due to the more efficient [[cooling_systems_in_data_centers | cooling systems]] affordable by hyperscale centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Types of Data Centers

Data centers vary widely in size and function, from small closet-sized setups to massive custom-built facilities spanning entire football fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. They are classified by floor space, number of servers, or power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The largest facilities are called "hyperscale," typically having around 5,000 servers and being 10,000 square meters large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These facilities, built by global operators like Google or Meta, support global-scale applications such as Gmail or Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Cloud providers also build distributed cloud data centers for security, latency, and reliability reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Corporate Water Usage Examples

*   **Google**: Used approximately 4.3 billion gallons of water for cooling in 2022, with 25% of that being reclaimed wastewater or seawater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Digital Realty**: A real estate investment trust with over 300 facilities, reported that about 36% of their water comes from municipal non-drinkable sources. Roughly half of their 2022 water consumption was in areas experiencing water strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **AWS**: Their 2022 Sustainability Report noted that 20 of their global data centers use recycled water for cooling, with 16 in Virginia, 2 in California, and 2 in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Microsoft**: Their 2022 sustainability report discusses commitments to becoming water positive, including sponsoring projects that replenish more water than they consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Microsoft's water consumption jumped 34% from 2021 to 2022, likely due to ChatGPT and other generative AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

## Water Sources and Location Challenges

For many large tech companies, the majority of water directly withdrawn for cooling is drinkable water from local municipal supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. This is a concern as 40-50% of the global population lives in areas with water scarcity, and many data centers need to be near large population centers <a class="yt>00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

Arizona, a leading state for data center development, is sunny and business-friendly but experiences drought conditions and relies heavily on the Colorado River for water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Meta, for instance, plans to fund projects to restore water in the Colorado River and Salt River basins and use long-term storage credits to avoid drawing from municipal water supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## [[technological_advancements_and_sustainability_in_data_centers | Technological Advancements and Sustainability in Data Centers]]

Companies are exploring various methods to reduce water and energy consumption:

### Free Cooling

"Free cooling" involves utilizing the natural environment to cool data centers, reducing the need for extensive HVAC systems or large amounts of evaporated water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

*   **Direct Free Cooling**: Leaving windows open is the simplest method, but outside air often requires dehumidification, filtration, and cleaning to protect electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Despite these needs, studies in Europe found average energy savings of 5.4-7.9%, and in Australia, up to 60% in southern capital cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:10:04]</a>. Cold climates offer significant advantages, which is why Nordic governments are attracting data center investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Meta plans to leverage direct free cooling to cut water usage by 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Waterside Free Cooling**: Data centers located near cold water sources can use that water for cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Google's Hamina data center in Finland uses fresh seawater from the Baltic Sea, with the two-loop cooling system preventing direct mixing of seawater with the internal cooling fluid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Microsoft's "Project Natick" also experimented with submerging a data center underwater for cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### Heat Recapture

Another strategy is to recover and reuse the heat generated by data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Recaptured heat can be used for various purposes, such as [[trends_in_desalination_and_energy_consumption | desalinating water]], pre-heating water in thermoelectric plants, direct power generation, or district heating for homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

Heat from air-cooled data centers can reach 35 to 45 degrees Celsius, suitable for space and water heating, which accounts for about 6% of America's total energy consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:12:03]</a>. However, heat cannot be efficiently moved as far as electricity, requiring demand sources (households) to be relatively close to the data center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The lack of existing district heating infrastructure in many cities also poses a challenge, although Nordic countries have made significant progress in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Adopting liquid cooling solutions can further improve heat recapture efficiency as liquid is more effective at capturing and transferring heat than air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

### Optimizing Temperature Ranges

The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends a temperature range of 15 to 32 degrees Celsius for data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Some operators run cooler, but raising a data center's temperature by even 1-2 degrees can yield significant financial benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Google has conducted tests showing their data centers can operate at higher temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

## Conclusion

The future of compute and AI will require substantially more electricity and, consequently, water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. This demand extends from the semiconductor fabrication stage (e.g., TSMC's energy consumption in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>) to the operation of data centers themselves, which generate heat requiring further energy to manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. To address the growing [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources | impact of infrastructure on water resources]] and energy consumption, future data centers will need to rapidly adopt a combination of free-cooling, waste heat recovery, and renewable energy sources like solar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. This transition is crucial for both environmental sustainability and financial viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

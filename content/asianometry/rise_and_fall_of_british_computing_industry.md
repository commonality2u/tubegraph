In 1968, the British government orchestrated the creation of International Computers Limited (ICL) by merging three existing computer manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The government envisioned ICL as the United Kingdom's answer to IBM, a national champion in the computing sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Despite the UK's pioneering role in computing technology, ICL struggled to compete against American and East Asian rivals and was eventually sold to Fujitsu by 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Origins in Punch Card Technology

The foundation of modern computing can be traced back to the 1880s when American inventor Hermann Hollerith developed an electromechanical tabulating machine for punched cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This machine was initially designed for the 1890 U.S. Census <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, revolutionizing data processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Hollerith established the Tabulating Machine Company (TMC) to market his invention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, which was later sold to a conglomerate called Computing Tabulating Recording Company (CTR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. In 1924, CTR rebranded itself as International Business Machines, or IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Punch card machines used cards for data input, output, and storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. By the 1920s, these machines could perform basic mathematical operations like multiplication and division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, proving immensely useful for businesses, such as managing magazine subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Despite advantages like relative durability, punch cards had limitations, including bending, breaking, and limited storage space (a two-inch stack of IBM cards held about 640 bytes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Fundamentally, these were calculating machines, not programmable computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### The British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM)

In 1907, Hollerith's British acquaintances, R.P. Porter and Sir Raleigh Philpotts, licensed his technology to found the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Hollerith granted BTM an exclusive license to his punch card technology throughout the British Empire (excluding Canada) in exchange for 25% of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This high royalty rate was agreed upon because Porter and Philpotts couldn't raise an initial £20,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. IBM later inherited this license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

The first BTM automatic tabulator, available in 1908, processed 150 cards per minute and quickly found buyers in large organizations like railways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. By 1911, the Registrar General used punch card technology for a population census in England and Wales, significantly popularizing its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

In the 1920s, IBM and BTM allied against their main rival, Power-Samas, a French-American conglomerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Despite BTM's access to IBM's superior products, R&D, and manufacturing, its sales lagged significantly behind its American counterpart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. IBM generated 20 times the revenue from a territory only twice as large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. IBM dominated the U.S. market with 90% share, but the British Empire market was evenly split between Power-Samas and BTM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. IBM executive Thomas Watson attributed BTM's underperformance to "sales incompetence," describing their style as "low-key and typically British," prioritizing leisure over business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. BTM, conversely, blamed the burdensome 25% royalty rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

In the 1930s, both Power-Samas and BTM expanded beyond simple import and sales, with BTM beginning to design its own machines due to a "Buy British" movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. By the outbreak of World War II, BTM had around 1,200 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## The Post-War Shift to Electronics

During World War II, British punch card firms ceased R&D, converting their facilities to produce precision military equipment like bomber aircraft frames and gun aimers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. After the war, while they rebuilt sales, it became clear that the industry was poised for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. The war had accelerated the development of electronics and the stored-program computer, signaling the obsolescence of the punch card industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

At the time, computers were seen as expensive, niche devices for governments and very large businesses, costing over a million dollars and being the size of a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Companies like IBM, BTM, and Power-Samas preferred selling smaller, lower-cost calculating machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Their approach was cautious, seeking "evolution not revolution" by adopting electronic aspects into existing product lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. IBM's first electronic calculator, the IBM 603 (1946), sold hundreds of units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The IBM 604 (1948) added limited programming capabilities and sold extremely well, with over 400 units still in use by 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### BTM's Breakup with IBM

1949 was a pivotal year for the British computing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. IBM and BTM mutually dissolved their decades-long sales agreement, agreeing to compete openly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. While BTM lost access to IBM's product lineup and R&D, it also eliminated the 25% royalty rate, tripling its operating profit for investment in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This decision, seemingly audacious given BTM's £5 million revenue compared to IBM's $400 million USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, was made without knowledge of the coming computer revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The original license had no end date and provided BTM access to all IBM products, including computers, at cost plus 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, keeping IBM out of British territories for half a century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### Government Intervention and Early British Computer Firms

Concerned about the UK's ability to capitalize on its scientific innovations, the Labour government founded the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. The NRDC aimed to develop public research and secure rights to inventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Lord Halsbury, NRDC's first general manager, visited IBM in 1949 and became convinced that electronic data processing computers were the future, famously predicting that punch cards would be in the British Museum within ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. (He was off by a few years, as the U.S. Social Security Administration used punch cards into the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.) Halsbury also believed the existing British computing industry couldn't compete with the American giant and urged British businesses to enter the computing sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

Several British companies ventured into computing:
*   **Ferranti**: An electronics manufacturer (est. 1883) that partnered with Manchester University to build a commercial computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Their Ferranti Mark One was installed in February 1951, just four months before UNIVAC I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.
*   **Elliott Brothers**: Another historic British firm (est. 1800s) that produced a stored-program computer in 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. In 1953, they became the second British firm to install a commercial computer, though it was low-powered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. They later focused on niche process computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   **English Electric**: A diversified manufacturer (est. post-WWI) that expanded into computers, collaborating with the National Physical Laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

Ferranti and Elliott were the most active in commercial computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>, but neither they nor American giants like GE, RCA, and Honeywell fully recognized the commercial potential of computers until the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### IBM's Dominance and British Consolidation

In 1955, IBM introduced the IBM 650, the world's first mass-produced computer and the first to turn a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Despite its success, only two IBM 650s were shipped to the UK in the 1950s, leaving an opening for domestic players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

BTM, despite having developed its own computer (HEC One) with the University of London, showed little interest in the computing space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Even with the release of the HEC4 in 1956, 90% of BTM's revenue still came from profitable punch card machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a> (IBM also derived 20% of its 1950s revenue from selling cards alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>).

By the late 1950s, IBM began challenging BTM in major export markets like Australia, South Africa, and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Power-Samas weakened, prompting BTM to merge with them in 1959, forming International Computers and Tabulators Limited (ICT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. This merger created a significant "headache" for BTM management, as integrating Power-Samas's mechanically-focused R&D department cost the new company years of progress that could have been spent on electronic computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. ICT, with 17,000 employees, committed half its R&D budget to computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

However, in 1959, IBM introduced the IBM 1401, a revolutionary computer using transistors instead of vacuum tubes, making it cheaper, faster, and more reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. The 1401, with its ecosystem of enterprise hardware and software, directly targeted the core use case of the punch card industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. It sold over 10,000 units, exceeding IBM's own expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a> and effectively obsoleting all first-generation vacuum tube computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

This forced British companies to either significantly increase their capacity to challenge IBM or withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. English Electric stayed, while Elliott Automation retreated to niche markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. Ferranti and GEC dropped out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. ICT and English Electric capitalized by acquiring the computing assets and employees of these dropouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>:
*   **ICT acquired**: GEC Computers (1961) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, Electrical and Musical Industries (EMI) computing interests (1962) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>, and Ferranti's computing interests (1963), which notably included the Canadian-made Ferranti Packard 6000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.
*   **English Electric acquired**: Leo Computers (1963) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a> and Marconi (1964) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

By 1964, the British computing industry largely consisted of English Electric and ICT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. This wave of consolidation, while sometimes beneficial (like [[rise_and_fall_of_australian_automobile_industry | Japan's successful intervention in its fragmented automobile industry]] during the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>), resulted in a "massive mess" for the British firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. Each merged company had different engineering approaches, techniques, and system administrations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. ICT, for example, made too many incompatible computer products, none of which were competitive except for the Ferranti Packard 6000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. This created a significant technology gap.

## The Software Crisis and IBM System/360

The transistor revolution led to a "software crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Each time hardware was upgraded, new software had to be written, causing software costs to surpass hardware costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. In response, IBM invested $500 million to develop the System/360, a range of computers (6 processors, 40 peripherals) designed to replace all previous IBM products with a single, scalable architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. This allowed customers to upgrade hardware without rewriting software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. The System/360, considered the third generation of computer systems, caught the entire industry off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

ICT had planned a family of computers for 1968 but accelerated development after IBM's System/360 launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. They reworked the Ferranti Packard 6000 into the ICT 1900 series, which sold well due to an IBM production delay in the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. English Electric licensed RCA's computer architecture, compatible with IBM System/360, and released their System 4 in 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. While successful with prestige customers, this deeply linked a top UK computer company to U.S. R&D, causing political unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

## The Birth of ICL and Its Challenges

In October 1964, the Harold Wilson government established the Ministry of Technology (MinTech), with the British computer industry as its top priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. Facing competition from American giants, the UK (and France) were concerned about America's widening technology gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. For example, General Electric purchased a controlling share of France's largest computer manufacturer, Bull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. Additionally, the USA denied export licenses for American computers to France to prevent its development of an H-bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. These concerns spurred the Concorde project and led France to launch Plan Calcul, a $100 million effort to create a French national computer champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. However, like many similar initiatives across Europe, Plan Calcul ultimately failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>, as no European company could compete with IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>.

The UK was one of the last European strongholds where IBM did not have dominant market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. MinTech sought to consolidate the industry by merging English Electric and ICT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Initial merger talks in 1964 failed, but after the Wilson government's re-election in 1966, they offered £30 million as an incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. By this time, ICT was doing well, but English Electric struggled with System 4 development costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. Though they agreed to merge in 1967, delays and a worsening UK economy led MinTech to reduce the dowry to £13.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.

The merger finalized in July 1968, creating ICL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. ICL generated £100 million in annual revenue, employed 34,000 people, and was the world's largest non-American computer manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>.

ICL's mission was to rationalize its computer range, boost R&D, and compete with IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. It inherited two incompatible mainframe product families: the 1900 series from ICT and System 4 from English Electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. While ICL initially wanted to phase out the outdated 1900 series, political pressure from the Labour government, which favored British-made products, prevented it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

ICL focused on selling high-end mainframe computers to prestige clients like Oxford University <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. This political interference kept ICL primarily as a mainframe manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>, ironically hastening its decline as it missed the mini-computer boom of the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

### Economic Downturns and Shifting Government Support

The computer industry's first recession in 1968 led General Electric and RCA to exit the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. ICL sought government aid, but the new Conservative government of Edward Heath (elected 1970) was anti-interventionist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>, even merging MinTech into the Department of Trade and Industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. Despite this stance, the UK government had to rescue Rolls-Royce in February 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>, highlighting the inconsistency when France and Germany were spending hundreds of millions supporting their own computer industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>.

In 1971, ICL laid off 3,000 workers and cut R&D spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. Ultimately, ICL received a £40 million government loan, which maintained R&D from 1972 to 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. However, it became clear ICL couldn't afford the rising R&D costs to remain competitive in the mainframe industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>. Annual R&D spend increased by 50% from 1974 to 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

Two major cost burdens were:
1.  **Software Development**: Over a third of ICL's R&D budget was dedicated to writing new operating systems for every new architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.
2.  **Semiconductor Production Cycles**: Accelerating semiconductor manufacturing technology meant product cycles were tightening, and ICL could no longer keep up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.

While ICL's overall R&D costs were around 7% of revenue, helped by its successful entry into the small business space with the 1976 acquisition of Singer Business Machines and its System 10 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>, the focus remained on the struggling mainframe business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. ICL began seeking collaborators with strong technical capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.

### Partnership with Fujitsu and Final Demise

Fujitsu was a Japanese computer company that had partnered with Amdahl Corporation to release advanced, IBM-compatible mainframes using Fujitsu's superior semiconductor technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>. By 1980, Fujitsu had become one of IBM's few real competitors and the only company to outsell IBM in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. IBM responded by tightening its semiconductor production cycle, releasing the IBM-4300 series which offered a fourfold improvement in cost performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>.

ICL, whose technology was once only three years behind IBM's, was caught in this fierce competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>. Projections in 1978 indicated that annual R&D spend would need to nearly triple by 1983 to £89 million to maintain competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

The 1980 economic recession, combined with a strong exchange rate between the British pound and the U.S. dollar, led ICL to project a £50 million loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. ICL sought government help, but the Thatcher government was initially reluctant, eventually agreeing to a £200 million loan guarantee conditional on management changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. Even with the loan, ICL cut 10,000 jobs between 1980 and 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

To manage R&D costs, ICL sought partnerships for semiconductor technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. American firms could offer 3,000 logic gates on a chip (compared to ICL's 1,000), but Fujitsu offered 5,000 gates and a five-year technology roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>. In 1981, ICL struck a technology transfer deal with Fujitsu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. ICL transferred peripheral technologies (disks, tapes) and sold Fujitsu's IBM-compatible mainframes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>, gaining access to Fujitsu's advanced semiconductor technology (which turned out to be 8,000 gates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. This collaboration led to the Series 39 computers in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

By 1984, ICL was taken over by British telecommunications firm Standard Telephone and Cables (STC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>. The mainframe market was becoming obsolete with the rise of the home computer (IBM released one in 1981) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. The 1981 rescue and the Fujitsu partnership ended ICL's hopes of being a national champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:06">[00:32:06]</a>. ICL slashed R&D, partnered with external vendors for products, closed manufacturing plants, and focused on sales and systems integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. It evolved into an assembler and distributor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. While ICL contributed significant profits to STC, it was no longer a computing leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>.

In 1990, Fujitsu acquired ICL, a minor shock to the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. Fujitsu initially promised to float the brand but shut it down for good after 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.

## Lessons from ICL's Downfall

The downfall of ICL illustrates several common trends:
*   **Lack of Technical Primacy**: The British computing industry consistently followed IBM and Japanese giants, unable to gain business leadership in its geographic domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.
*   **Industry Splintering**: Predictions of a vertically integrated telecom-like computer industry, with IBM as the combine, proved wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>. Instead, intense competition and market size led to splintering, with individual companies specializing in niche products like software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. This raised the stakes, making it impossible for combines like ICL to keep up with specialized companies like Microsoft in areas like operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>.
*   **Hollowness of National Prestige**: ICL and its political sponsors aimed to beat IBM in its strongest area – big, bulky mainframe computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>. They invested to be like IBM but could never muster the same resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>. Ultimately, they faced the same market circumstances that led to IBM's decline in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>.

India is recognized as a semiconductor design powerhouse, with nearly every major semiconductor company maintaining a presence in the country to design advanced chips [00:00:00]. However, once these designs are finalized, they must be sent to the United States, [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts|China]], South Korea, or Taiwan for fabrication [00:00:10]. This highlights India's significant dependency on foreign manufacturing for its semiconductor needs. As of 2019, 100% of India's chips, including logic and memory, are imported from abroad [00:15:20]. In 2019, India imported $21 billion worth of semiconductors, a number growing at approximately 15% per year [00:15:28].

## Historical Attempts at Domestic Fabrication

In the 1980s, the Indian government attempted to establish its own semiconductor manufacturing capability, aiming to follow countries like [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts|China]], Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, and Singapore [00:00:23]. This effort involved creating a "national champion" company [00:00:30].

### Semiconductor Complex Limited (SCL)

In 1984, the Indian government founded Semiconductor Complex Limited (SCL), a 100% state-owned integrated device manufacturer [00:01:55]. SCL's objective was to design and manufacture leading-edge circuits and electronics, intending to form the foundation of a native Indian electronics industry [00:02:04]. The government invested between $40 to $70 million USD into the venture [00:02:15]. SCL was headquartered in Mohali, Punjab, an emerging electronics industry center at the time [00:02:22].

SCL recruited young graduates from top technical universities like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, known for training skilled engineering talent [00:02:42].

### Factors for Semiconductor Manufacturing Success

The successful operation of a high-performing semiconductor factory depends on four key categories:
*   **Financial Capital** Significant funds are required for extremely expensive chip manufacturing equipment (especially photolithography and testing equipment), as well as ongoing upgrades and maintenance [00:03:34]. In India's case, all such equipment must be imported from places like Europe or Japan, involving import duties and complex documentation [00:03:52].
*   **Human Capital** Smart, well-educated people are needed to run the fabrication facilities, including skilled labor familiar with equipment and PhDs for research and development [00:04:01]. India is considered strong in this aspect [00:04:16].
*   **Government/Infrastructure** Substantial, near 100% government buy-in is necessary, along with stable power and water supply [00:04:20]. The manufacturing process is also toxic, requiring environmental considerations [00:04:28]. While government buy-in was present for SCL, India faced challenges with infrastructure, as a single power outage or water shortage could ruin months of work [00:04:31].
*   **Manufacturing Technology** To quickly catch up with the industry, companies need to acquire older process node technology through technology transfer deals [00:04:42].

### SCL's Initial Progress

SCL was able to license 5 Micron process technology from American Microsystems Inc. (AMI) at its founding in 1984 [00:05:33]. Subsequently, it acquired process technology from Rockwell (for 2560g microprocessors) [00:05:54] and Hitachi (for electronic wristwatch components) [00:06:03]. SCL also performed third-party assembly, notably for the BBC Acorn computer used in an Indian government computer literacy program [00:06:08]. These technology transfer agreements facilitated in-person training for SCL personnel in the U.S. and Japan, which was then disseminated within the company [00:06:24]. By the late 1980s, SCL rapidly advanced from 5 Micron to 0.8 Micron process technology [00:06:41]. At this point, SCL was only one semiconductor generation behind leading-edge companies like NTT, Toshiba, and Intel, which achieved 0.8 microns in 1987 [00:06:51]. This progress suggested that India might achieve its goal of becoming a global semiconductor manufacturer within a decade [00:07:02].

### The SCL Disaster and Its Aftermath

These hopes were shattered in 1989 when a devastating fire broke out at SCL [00:07:09]. The cause remains unknown, though semiconductor fires are not rare due to flammable chemicals [00:07:15]. The fire caused extensive damage due to toxic and corrosive gases, further exacerbated by the sprinkler system [00:07:52]. This incident was a severe setback for [[history_of_indias_semiconductor_industry|India's semiconductor manufacturing efforts]] [00:07:46].

It took eight years and over $50 million USD for production to restart at SCL in 1997 [00:08:01]. By then, new entrants like TSMC (founded 1987) and Samsung had entered the market, rapidly advancing and capturing significant global market share [00:08:11]. India lost "untold amounts of progress" [00:08:24].

The government's subsequent attempts to recover included:
*   Trying to sell the fabrication plant (Fab), but terms could not be agreed upon with private investors [00:08:33].
*   Retooling the Fab from making chips for telephone exchanges to smart cards, which also failed to gain traction [00:08:42].
*   In 2005, SCL was restructured as an R&D center within the Department of Space, effectively ending its chances as a competitive commercial entity [00:08:50].

SCL's offerings were not competitive even in the domestic Indian market [00:09:12]. Despite government contracts, the company struggled with profitability due to a lack of economies of scale [00:09:19]. For example, in 2005-2006, SCL produced only 1,000 six-inch wafers despite having 20 times that installed capacity [00:09:28]. Its revenue in 2005-2006 was $3.5 million, with a $2 million loss [00:09:43].

Today, SCL (renamed Semiconductor Laboratory) primarily conducts R&D [00:10:01]. As of 2019, it can accept chip designs at the 180 nanometer node, which is far from the leading edge [00:10:07]. This development has been extremely sluggish, taking nearly a decade for SCL to reach this node, despite paying millions for a fabrication unit from Israel's Tower Jazz semiconductor in 2011 [00:10:32].

## Ongoing Challenges and Failed Initiatives

Even before the fire, SCL faced financial strain from competing in the semiconductor business [00:11:04]. The costs of advancing to 800 nanometers forced them to abandon projects like the BBC Acorn computer [00:11:09]. Talented SCL personnel frequently left for better private sector or overseas jobs [00:11:16].

The immense capital needed for competitive Fabs has been the most significant obstacle for [[history_of_indias_semiconductor_industry|India's semiconductor manufacturing industry]] [00:11:22]. Leading-edge chip factories today cost tens of billions of dollars, a trend that significantly increased around the 14-nanometer node generation [00:11:34]. Such investments are difficult even for large Indian private entities like Tata and Reliance [00:11:46]. For context, Reliance Jio spent $15 billion USD on its nationwide LTE network over four years, while TSMC spends $20 billion on a single gigafab over two years [00:11:52].

Despite these challenges, the Indian government has repeatedly attempted to revive domestic semiconductor manufacturing, though all efforts have failed [00:12:15].
*   In 2006, a $3 billion "Fab City" project was announced [00:12:25]. AMD was interested in an assembly and test facility there, but bad industry conditions led to its shutdown [00:12:29].
*   In 2013, customs duties on semiconductor manufacturing imports were lifted, but this did not stimulate foundry efforts [00:12:36].
*   In 2014, India approved proposals from two investor groups to build Fabs, costing about $10 billion [00:12:48]. The government offered substantial financial support, including 25% of the total cost, interest-free loans, tax breaks, and subsidies [00:12:57].
    *   The first consortium, involving Jai Prakash (JP) Associates Limited, Israel's Tower Jazz, and IBM, pulled out in 2016, citing debt and commercial non-viability [00:13:05].
    *   The second consortium, led by Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (HSMC) with expertise from STMicroelectronics and Siltera, also failed. The government canceled HSMC's letter of intent in 2019 due to a failure to submit commitment documents [00:13:31].

Since then, no serious Indian proposal for a competitive Fab has emerged, despite favorable market conditions [00:14:18].

## Implications of Import Dependency

India's lack of substantial semiconductor fabrication capacity has significant implications:
*   **Economic Vulnerability** In 2020, India was impacted by the worldwide semiconductor shortage, disrupting critical Indian businesses [00:15:41]. As the world's second-largest smartphone maker, India's lucrative industry grinds to a halt without the necessary chips [00:15:50].
*   **Geopolitical Repercussions** A significant portion of India's semiconductor imports (37% or $7 billion in 2019) comes from [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts|China]] [00:15:57]. This reliance creates critical geopolitical vulnerabilities, especially given the tense Sino-Indian relations [00:16:06].

## Conclusion

While India retains world-class chip design capabilities, with tens of thousands of engineers working in VLSI design and chips taped out in leading-edge fabs globally [00:14:26], the failure of SCL and subsequent initiatives has left India without substantial domestic fabrication capacity [00:15:05]. The split between chip design and manufacturing means that companies no longer need to do both [00:14:44].

To establish semiconductor manufacturing in India, consistent, long-term direction from the highest levels of government and significant financial commitment are essential [00:16:24]. The market has passed the phase where a private entity can seed a thriving semiconductor manufacturing industry without external government support [00:16:34]. The government must do more to catch up [00:16:41].

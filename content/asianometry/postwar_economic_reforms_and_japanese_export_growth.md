Before and during World War II, Japan's economy was largely controlled by powerful family-owned industrial combines known as [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan|Zaibatsu]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These entities, literal "financial clans," amassed immense wealth and influence, shaping the nation's economic landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. However, a series of radical postwar reforms drastically reduced their power and wealth, leading to a fundamental shift in Japan's economic direction towards an export-oriented industrial strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## The Rise of the Zaibatsu

The foundation of the [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan|Zaibatsu]]'s power can be traced back to the [[meiji_reformation_and_industrialization|Meiji Restoration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. After Commodore Matthew Perry forced Japan's opening in the 1850s, revealing a massive industrial gap, the ruling Tokugawa military government attempted to modernize, draining the treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This led to the overthrow of the shoguns by a group of samurai, initiating the Meiji Restoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The Meiji government sought to rapidly [[meiji_reformation_and_industrialization|industrialize]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a> to avoid Western colonization, establishing numerous state-owned enterprises (SOEs) in sectors like railways, breweries, cement, and shipbuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. These SOEs were not expected to be profitable initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. By the late 1870s, SOE losses threatened government bankruptcy, leading to privatization efforts in the 1880s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Initially, money-losing enterprises didn't sell, so the government included profitable ones, especially mines, in subsequent sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Merchant families acquired these assets, particularly the revitalized mines like the Mikay coal mine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This transfer of public assets into private hands was significant, comparable to the creation of Russian oligarchs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. These families, forming the [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan|Zaibatsu]], established holding companies controlling numerous subsidiaries run by professional managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. They funded expansion by milking natural resource "cash cows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. For example, the Mitsui family, after switching allegiance to the Meiji government, acquired mines, established Mitsui Bank, Mitsui Mining, and Mitsui Bussan (a general trading company), and vertically integrated into chemicals and shipbuilding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

By the 1920s, as natural resource profits declined, the [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan|Zaibatsu]] sold minority stakes in subsidiaries to the public, raising capital while retaining control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. This, combined with income from land assets, generated immense passive income, increasing the wealth of the top 1% 3.5 times faster than the national average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The government tolerated this wealth inequality because the [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan|Zaibatsu]] aided industrialization and later, militarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan|Zaibatsu]] provided raw goods and materials for Japan's expansionist drives in the early 20th century, including the invasion of China, reaping massive government contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Postwar Reforms and Zaibatsu Dissolution

The [[impact_of_world_war_ii_on_japanese_economy|impact of World War II on the Japanese economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> fundamentally altered the [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan|Zaibatsu]]'s fate. Before Japan's entry into the war, a military government criticized the [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan|Zaibatsu]]'s "short-term focus" on profits and de facto took control of their investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. During the war, their wealth was substantially reduced due to war damage to productive assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. The government also regulated rents, wages, and land prices, reduced returns on financial assets by intervening in markets to sell war bonds, and, crucially, confiscated and redistributed agricultural land from landlords to tenant farmers starting in 1938 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This accidental land reform continued after the war under occupation authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

After the war in 1946, the government instituted a capital tax, taxing [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan|Zaibatsu]] family taxable assets at an 85% rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. For example, Sumitomo Kuchizaymo, head of the Sumitomo [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan|Zaibatsu]], lost 89% of his taxable assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

In September 1946, trust-busting economists, recalling the American Great Depression, ordered the [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan|Zaibatsu]] to be dissolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Ten [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan|Zaibatsu]] families were targeted, including the "Big Four" (Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Yasuda, and Sumitomo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The Holding Company Liquidation Commission (HCLC) seized stocks and bonds worth billions of yen from holding companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. In early 1947, the HCLC ordered top family executives and associates to resign, removing nearly 2,000 executives and hundreds of businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. A second purge in January 1948 identified 56 family heads and removed 309 relatives and 2,798 high-ranking executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. The HCLC also acquired individuals' personally held stocks and bonds, with half going to the government as part of the capital tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

Although the families received cash compensation for seized assets, these proceeds were deposited into a national bank with limited withdrawals until 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This restriction, combined with triple-digit annual hyperinflation during those years, caused the real value of their cash holdings to plummet by 97% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. By 1950, the top 1% of Japanese earners derived half their income from employment, indicating a significant reduction in passive wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

This period led to a broad democratization of Japanese stocks; while [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan|Zaibatsu]] owned one out of four stocks in 1946, this fell to one out of 20 by 1950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## Shift to Export-Oriented Growth

The occupation authorities stopped short of a total dismemberment of the companies themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. The significant outcome of these reforms was that the government bureaucracy, specifically the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), gained de facto policy and guidance control over Japan's massive corporate apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

Previously, [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan|Zaibatsu]] families managed their "company fiefdoms" to grow personal wealth, dominating the domestic market, suppressing competition, and avoiding the "risky" export market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. The "reset" — the dismantling of [[zaibatsu_economic_influence_in_japan|Zaibatsu]] control and redistribution of wealth — allowed MITI to push Japanese companies onto a new, pro-export industrial path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

With their ranks now filled with a new generation of professional managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, Japan's industries focused outwards. They pioneered a "catch-up strategy," which many other East Asian "tigers" later emulated: acquire and master foreign technology, then use that expertise to create products the world would buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. This export discipline was crucial in creating the Japanese economic miracle of the 1950s and 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

Undersea cables serve as the "unheralded backbones" of our global communications network, carrying vast amounts of information across the globe and supporting our hyper-connected, high-tech world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Despite their importance, these cables face a dangerous environment, susceptible to various natural, animal, and human hazards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## [[history_of_undersea_cables | Evolution of Cable Protection]]
Early attempts at underwater cabling highlighted the need for robust [[construction_and_design_of_undersea_cables | designs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Samuel Thomas von SÃ¶mmerring's early telegraph cables in 1811 used rubber insulation, which failed due to water absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Dr. William Brooke O'Shaughnessy later pioneered wrapping wire in rattan and tar-covered yarn, successfully sealing cables from river water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The first proposed transatlantic cable by the Brett Brothers in 1845 used gutta percha insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This cable, laid in 1850, failed quickly after carrying only a few distorted signals, reportedly cut by a French fisherman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

A significant breakthrough came in 1851 when Thomas Russell Crampton devised wrapping the cable in steel wire, a [[construction_and_design_of_undersea_cables | model]] that most submarine cables have followed since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Modern cables generally consist of a core of copper wires, insulated with gutta percha (later replaced by polyethylene in the 1940s), a cushioning layer, and external armoring steel wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Some early cables also included powdered silica or brass tape to deter bacteria in tropical waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

With the introduction of [[modern_advancements_in_undersea_cable_technology | optic fiber]] in the 1980s, cable [[construction_and_design_of_undersea_cables | designs]] were tweaked, leading to various cable variants suited for different environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. These include:
*   **Lightweight cables:** For shallow, safe waters, with steel wires and polyethylene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Lightweight Protective Cables:** Added polyethylene and steel tape layers to combat animals and chafing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Single-armored cables:** A single layer of steel wire and polyethylene for areas with greater risks of cable-cutting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Double-armored cables:** Two armoring layers of galvanized steel wires, used in shallow, high-traffic areas where cables cannot be buried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

[[challenges_of_subsea_cable_installation | Laying cables]] involves complex processes, with cable-laying boats carrying thousands of tons of cable, deploying it via a "cable highway" and a Linear Cable Engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Repeaters are added every 60 to 80 kilometers to amplify signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, and "jointing" involves delicate splicing and re-encapsulation of cable segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Environmental Hazards

Undersea cables are exposed to significant natural hazards:

### Chafing and Corrosion
Chafing occurs when currents and waves rub the cable against rocks and gravel, removing its outer protective layers and exposing the core <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Corrosion is often induced by biological creatures. In shallower waters, barnacles, shells, or sponges can cover and foul the cable, while in deeper waters, kelp and corals can encase the cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Landslides and Earthquakes
Underwater landslides, characterized by "turbidity currents" of fast-moving water and sediment, can cut cables at speeds of up to 45 miles per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. These events have plagued cables since the 1880s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

Notable incidents include:
*   **Grand Banks Earthquake of 1929:** A magnitude 7.2 earthquake off Canada triggered a massive underwater landslide, cutting eleven cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This is considered a textbook example of underwater landslide hazards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Taiwan Earthquakes of 2006:** A pair of magnitude 7.0 earthquakes off Taiwan triggered multiple landslides, breaking several cables and disrupting communications in Taiwan and Southeast Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

Landslides are particularly problematic in delta areas where rivers dump large amounts of silt, biological material, and dirt, forming unstable "slumps" that can move and break cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Earthquakes themselves can also cause the seafloor to slide and reposition, breaking cables traversing the affected area; the Grand Banks Earthquake alone cut 12 cables through seismic movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

## Animal Hazards
While rare, animals can damage cables:
*   **Whales:** Whales can become entangled in cables while searching for food on the ocean floor, often leading to drowning as they struggle to free themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Sharks:** Sharks occasionally bite cables, though the reason for this behavior is not entirely understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Proper reinforcement helps solve this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Human Hazards
Human activities account for two-thirds of all cable breaks in depths under 200 meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Fishermen
*   **Ship Anchors:** Dropping or retrieving anchors can drag along the seabed, cutting the external armor and internal core of exposed cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Otter-trawl nets:** These large cone-shaped nets, used for catching bottom fish, employ heavy "otterboards" that can snag and damage unburied cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Beam trawls:** These heavy (4-5 tons) cone-shaped nets have sliders or shoes that scrape the ocean floor, capable of cutting exposed cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. While newer "wing gear" designs float above the seabed, they can still slice cable insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

The 1884 Cable Convention dictates that if a fisherman's equipment gets caught in a cable, they are obliged to sacrifice it and report the incident, in return for an indemnity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Due to these hazards, operators often bury cables in trenches or apply double armor in waters less than 1,500 meters deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. In deeper waters, cables are typically left on the ocean floor as anchor hazards are less significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### Sabotage
While most breaks are accidental, intentional cable cuts do occur:
*   **Theft:** Cables are sometimes cut for financial gain, with thieves selling the copper inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. A notable incident in March 2007 involved vessels removing 79 and 98 kilometers of cable from Southeast Asian networks, impacting Vietnam's internet for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Such incidents have also occurred in Jamaica, Indonesia, and Egypt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Laws governing cable cuts outside a country's exclusive economic zone (200 miles from shore) can be unclear, leading to minimal or no punishment for perpetrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Asymmetrical Warfare:** Cable cutting is a critical focus in war planning due to its ability to interrupt communications for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Historically, British control of the subsea cable network cut off the Central Powers in World War I from overseas possessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, and forced Axis powers in World War II to rely on encrypted radio, enabling interception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. More recently, cable cuts have been reported in the Red Sea, impacting internet speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. The ease of cutting a cable (e.g., by dragging an anchor) and the high repair costs make it effective for asymmetrical warfare, being easy to execute and deny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

## [[protection_and_security_measures_for_undersea_cables | Protecting the Cables]]
The most effective [[protection_and_security_measures_for_undersea_cables | protection]] method is to bury cables in deep trenches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. This is achieved using high-pressure water jets or "underwater trenching machines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. The burial depth depends on conditions, typically no more than 2 meters, though deeper burial is required for soft seabeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. The "Burial Protection Index," once used to gauge depth, is now considered outdated, relying on the integrator's risk assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Alternatives for hard ground include:
*   **Riprap (Rock Armor):** Laying smaller rocks on top of the cable, followed by larger ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This works best in calm water currents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   **Cover plates or casing pipes:** Shells that encase the cable, potentially with additional riprap for extra [[protection_and_security_measures_for_undersea_cables | protection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

Despite engineering advancements for natural hazards, a determined attacker can still easily cut a cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Therefore, [[protection_and_security_measures_for_undersea_cables | security]] largely relies on obscuration, depth, and physical protections like trenches and riprap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Undersea cables continue to carry the majority of the world's internet and telephone traffic, making their [[protection_and_security_measures_for_undersea_cables | protection]] critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

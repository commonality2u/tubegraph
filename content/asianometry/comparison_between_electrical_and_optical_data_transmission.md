Historically, networking companies relied on electrical signals transmitted through copper wires for communication [00:01:10]. However, with the rapid increase in data traffic by the 1990s, the limitations of electrical transmission became apparent, leading to a revolution in long-distance communication [00:01:24].

## Electrical Data Transmission

In electrical data transmission, electrons travel through copper wires [00:01:14]. A significant issue with this method is that electrons interact with other atoms within the wires, which causes them to slow down and generate heat [00:01:16]. This interaction limits the speed and efficiency of data transfer, making it challenging to cope with the exploding demands of network traffic [00:01:28]. Even today, transistors on traditional chips predominantly communicate using electrons through wires [00:02:53].

## Optical Data Transmission

To overcome the challenges of electrical signals, networking companies transitioned to using light sent via optical fiber for efficient data transmission over great distances [00:01:30].

Key advantages of optical transmission include:
*   **Speed** Light travels through optical fiber at the speed of light, which is the fastest possible speed [00:01:38].
*   **High Frequencies and Data Volume** This allows for the transmission of optical signals at super high frequencies, leading to higher data volume transmissions [00:01:45].
*   **Non-Interference** Engineers advanced the concept further by sending multiple signals through the same fiber using different light wavelengths that do not interfere with each other [00:01:52].

Today, [[Technological advancements in cable design | optical fiber technologies]] dominate the long-distance communication space, with over 2 billion kilometers of optical fiber deployed globally [00:02:03]. This amount is enough to wrap around the world more than 50,000 times [00:02:09].

## The Future of Data Transmission: Silicon Photonics

The idea of replacing copper wires and electrons within chips with optical fibers and light is a central aspiration of [[Introduction to Silicon Photonics | Silicon Photonics]] [00:03:00]. While optical fiber is superior for long-distance communication, integrating light-based communication directly onto silicon chips presents unique challenges, particularly regarding the size of components.

While leading-edge transistors currently have feature sizes as small as a few nanometers [00:14:00], [[Introduction to Silicon Photonics | photonics]] components cannot be made smaller than the wavelength of the light they carry, which tops out at about one micrometer [00:14:08]. In contrast, electrons have wavelengths of just a few nanometers [00:14:14]. This size discrepancy means that a single square micrometre of real estate on a 7-nanometer node chip can house over a hundred transistors, representing a very high opportunity cost for larger [[Introduction to Silicon Photonics | photonics]] components [00:14:19].

This size limitation is steering the industry away from highly integrated [[Introduction to Silicon Photonics | silicon photonics]] monolithic chips and towards packaging solutions that pair [[Introduction to Silicon Photonics | photonics]] and traditional chiplets together [00:14:29].

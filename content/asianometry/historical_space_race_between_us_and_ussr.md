During the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Union successfully landed five probes on the surface of Venus, each surviving for over 30 minutes, an achievement no other nation has replicated since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While the United States succeeded in putting a man on the Moon, they never attempted to deploy a legitimate lander on Venus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The Soviets, however, would achieve this five times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Driving Forces Behind the Space Race

The pursuit of Venusian exploration was deeply intertwined with the [[competition_between_soviet_union_and_united_states_in_space_exploration | space race]] between the Soviet Union and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The Soviets aimed to "outdo the Americans by piercing the Venusian veil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This drive was particularly evident in 1967 when, as American capitalists were preparing to send a flyby probe (Mariner 5) to Venus, the Soviets pushed to launch their Venera 4 mission first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Challenges of Venus

Venus is considered one of the most challenging planets to land on in the Solar System, second only to the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Often called "Earth's evil twin," Venus shares a similar size and proximity to Earth but possesses an extremely different atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This is due to a runaway greenhouse effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Key environmental challenges include:
*   **Extreme Heat:** The surface temperature reaches 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 Celsius), hotter than Mercury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Crushing Pressure:** Surface pressure is equivalent to being over 0.5 miles (1 kilometer) underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Corrosive Atmosphere:** The thick clouds are composed of sulfuric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Atmospheric Entry Heat:** Friction during atmospheric entry can heat a probe to 11,000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Early Soviet Missions: Venera Series (1967-1972)

By late 1967, the Soviets had experienced eleven failed launches to Venus, leading up to the Venera 4 mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The Venera project's goal was to land a probe on the Venusian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Venera 4 (1967)
After Venera 3 failed to reach the ground, the entire mission was transferred to the aerospace company Lavochkin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Venera 4, an 11-foot (3.5-meter) tall probe with a pressure shell lander, launched in autumn 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   It reached Venus in October 1967 and successfully launched its lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   During entry, temperatures reached 11,000 degrees Celsius, and forces hit 450G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   Instruments began sending back data, but pressure and temperature rose rapidly, far exceeding engineers' expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   93 minutes into the mission, 27 kilometers above the surface, Venera 4 was crushed at 22 atmospheres and 530 degrees Fahrenheit (277 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Data Collaboration: Soviets and Americans
Around the same time, the American probe Mariner 5 reached Venus, flying past the planet and transmitting atmospheric data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. The Soviets and Americans compared their data, confirming that Venus was a much hotter, drier, and more hostile planet than previously thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This new understanding necessitated intense engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Venera 5 and 6 (1969)
Despite the new insights, Venera 5 and 6 were already in final construction for their 1969 launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Engineers made minor strengthening changes but deferred radical redesigns for later missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   Venera 5 transmitted data for 53 minutes before succumbing to 27 atmospheres of pressure and temperatures of 600 degrees Fahrenheit (320 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   Venera 6 lasted 51 minutes, descending 37.8 kilometers before being crushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Venera 7 (1970)
Determined to reach the surface by the 1970 launch window, Soviet engineers consulted submarine designers for pressure survival, sourced new materials, and developed stronger test chambers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The lander was designed as a smooth, titanium egg, lined with shock absorbers and insulation, and pre-chilled to freezing temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   Venera 7 arrived in December 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   Its parachute melted or tore, causing it to drop rapidly, hitting the ground at 35 miles per hour (60 kilometers per hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   Initially thought lost, radio astronomers later rediscovered an extremely weak signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The probe had bounced and landed on its side, misaligning its antenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   Venera 7 transmitted data for 23 minutes on the surface, enduring temperatures hot enough to melt zinc or lead, before its shell cracked and it melted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Venera 8 (1972)
Venera 8, launched two years after Venera 7, used a similar design, and its data helped pave the way for a new generation of probes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## Advanced Soviet Missions: Venera Series (1975-1982)

By 1975, five years after Venera 7, Soviet engineers had a clear understanding of the Venusian environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

### Venera 9 and 10 (1975)
These probes were designed to achieve more, including sending back the first black-and-white photographs of the Venusian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. New rockets, developed for Moon and Mars missions, allowed for significantly larger probes; Venera 9 and 10 were five times heavier than their predecessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   The lander was a hermetically sealed titanium sphere, 2.6 feet (80 centimeters) wide, bolted with gold wire seals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
*   Internal shelves of beryllium and electric fans dispersed heat, and the sphere was lined with polyurethane foam and wrapped in 5 inches (12 centimeters) of honeycomb composite insulation, plus another titanium layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   An aerobrake, replacing the problematic two-stage parachute, slowed the lander after parachute detachment at 30 miles (50 kilometers) above the surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   Equipped with goldfish-bowl lenses protected by pure quartz pressure windows, the cameras sent images at one line every 3.5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   Venera 9 landed on a slight slope, transmitting the first-ever pictures of the Venusian surface, revealing sharp rocks, soil, and a distant horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   Venera 10 landed on a rolling plain with hardened magma, showing older, chemically scorched rocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
*   Both probes transmitted for 50-60 minutes until their orbiters moved out of range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   Venera 9 and 10 were hailed as stunning successes and a triumphant public relations event for the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Venera 11 and 12 (1978)
These missions performed scientific experiments but are largely forgotten due to a mysterious electrical anomaly that disabled their cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### Venera 13 and 14 (1982)
The final landers refined the designs of Venera 9 and 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   Engineers improved cameras and scientific instruments, added new heat-resistant technologies, and guaranteed at least 30 minutes of surface operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   Sensors and instruments were mounted outside the spherical pressure chamber, made of platinum and covered in acid-resistant enamel, demonstrating the engineers' advanced understanding of the Venusian environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   Venera 13 landed first, taking both black-and-white and color photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. The images revealed pebbled, loose soil amidst bedrock, resembling an ocean floor, under an orange sky due to blue light absorption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   Venera 14's images showed a more weathered plain with fine-grained rock, appearing like a baked cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   Both probes carried microphones, recording sounds like the lens cap blowing off, the drill, and a gentle wind with faint rumblings presumed to be Venus-quakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

## Conclusion of Soviet Lander Missions
Venera 13 and 14 marked the last landers to touch the Venusian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Subsequent Venera missions (15 and 16 in the 1980s) focused on mapping Venusian topography from orbit using radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

The Venera series stands as an "amazing engineering achievement" and, in the opinion of some, represented the "pinnacle of [the Soviet Union's] space exploration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>, particularly given that the Soviets accomplished this with decades-old technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. While human presence on Venus is unlikely, future lander missions are possible, though economic and cost-benefit considerations currently favor high-altitude atmospheric exploration over surface missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

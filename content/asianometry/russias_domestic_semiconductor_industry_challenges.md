In late February 2022, Taiwan's Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a halt to shipments to Russia in compliance with new sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This decision impacted Russian "fabless" companies like Baikal, MCST, Yadro, and STC Module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Intel and AMD also ceased their shipments to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Despite efforts in recent years to create a domestic supply of semiconductors, Russia's capacity to manufacture its own designs has lagged significantly behind its design successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Historical Context

Russia's struggles in semiconductor manufacturing have deep roots in Soviet history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Since the 1960s, the Soviet Union suffered from a massive technology gap with the United States in computers and advanced electronics, primarily due to issues rooted in ideology, technology, and geopolitics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. By the time of the Soviet collapse in 1991, the country was severely impacted by a shortage of sufficiently powerful integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The combined computing power of all computers in the country was two generations behind a single American Cray supercomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The collapse further fragmented the Soviet scientific industrial complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Russia was left with 96% of the vacuum electronics production facilities, while the more advanced semiconductor production facilities were located in regions like [[industrial_challenges_faced_by_east_germany_in_semiconductor_production | East Germany]], Belarus, and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Russian industrial policy post-collapse exacerbated this issue by shifting away from domestic electronics, leading to increased reliance on imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Today, Russia remains a net importer of integrated circuits, primarily from Malaysia, China, Vietnam, and other Asian countries, including Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Key Domestic Players and Their Challenges

In 2014, threatened sanctions following the annexation of Crimea prompted the Russian government to pursue developing homegrown chips through an import substitution scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This initiative led to the creation of the Elbrus 2SM, a 90-nanometer CPU developed by the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies and fabricated within Russia by JSC Micron Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Micron Group

Micron Group is Russia's largest domestic semiconductor manufacturing company, operating as an integrated design manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. It accounts for 54% of the country's exported technology hardware products, producing approximately 500 million chips annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The company traces its roots back to 1964 as the Research Institute for Molecular Electronics, responsible for the country's first successful integrated circuit production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. In the 1970s and 80s, it produced microprocessors for defense and space programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Along with Angstrom of Russia and Integral of Belarus, Micron formed the "big three" Soviet IC manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Today, Micron specializes in RFID tickets, SIM cards, and smart card products, fabricating chips for Russia's domestic payment card system, Mir, and Moscow's transport network tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

**Technological Lag and Financial Hurdles:**
Micron's Zelenograd fab produces 100, 150, and 200-millimeter wafers, with the 200-millimeter line being the most sophisticated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. In 2007, Micron acquired intellectual property for STMicroelectronics' 180-nanometer process node, expanding to the 90-nanometer node in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The 90-nanometer production line, launched in 2012 at a cost of 16.5 billion rubles (approximately $590 million), was jointly financed by Russnano, a government fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. This node, first commercially available in 2003, put Russia about nine years behind the leading edge at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Micron attempted to develop the 65-nanometer node independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. In 2014, they announced the successful achievement of the 65-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. However, this announcement appears to have been premature, as the process was more a "working science experiment" than a commercial offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Without adequate lithography scanners, primarily imported from the West or Japan, a 65-nanometer line is not commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Micron's website still lists its 65-nanometer production line as "under development, production qualification, and implementation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. As commercial 65-nanometer nodes were shipping from Fujitsu, Toshiba, and TSMC in 2005, Russia's technology gap has widened to 15-plus years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

In 2016, Micron's management was replaced, with ambitious plans announced to expand the factory and achieve 30 billion rubles of revenue by 2020, including a 28-nanometer capable factory by 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The company missed this 2020 revenue target by 15 billion rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Citronix

Citronix, a sister company to Micron, applied for a subsidy in 2007 to develop a chip manufacturing fab at the 65 and 45-nanometer process nodes on 300-millimeter wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This proposed project, jointly financed with the Russian government, was estimated to cost about $2.3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Despite initial plans for production to begin in 2009, the sheer capital intensity and lack of technology partners seem to have prevented the project from moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Currently, Citronix's website lists servers, IT software, and smartwatches, but no chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Angstrom

Angstrom, another leading Russian microelectronics fab based in Zelenograd, dates back to 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. It was known for developing the Elektronika NTS-8010, the Soviet Union's first completely domestic computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. The foundry currently offers 130-nanometer and 90-nanometer process nodes on 200-millimeter wafers, with a capacity of about 180,000 wafers per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This capacity is a stark contrast to a TSMC gigafab, which produces an equivalent number in a single month, highlighting Angstrom's lack of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

Angstrom filed for bankruptcy around 2018-2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. In 2008, the company borrowed nearly a billion dollars from the state development bank VEB to purchase old 110 and 130-nanometer chip-making equipment from AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The plan was to produce 90-nanometer smart card microchips by 2010 and upgrade to the 65-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. However, chips only started rolling off the line in 2016, and their 65-nanometer process is still unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Subsequently, US sanctions, likely due to Angstrom's involvement in the Russian military and nuclear industries, prevented it from building an export business, leading to insolvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. In 2021, VEB's subsidiary, NM Tech, purchased Angstrom's assets, announcing a 10-year plan to convert it into a pure-play foundry and achieve 10-nanometer production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

## Reliance on Foreign Foundries for Advanced Designs

Due to the lagging capabilities of the domestic industry, more sophisticated Russian semiconductor design ventures have had to outsource fabrication abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

*   **Elbrus Microprocessors:** The Elbrus 2SM, declared Russia's top technology achievement in 2014, was the first "completely Russian" microprocessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Despite domestic fabrication by Micron, the initial iteration of the processor was made using a TSMC 90-nanometer node, which reportedly performed better than the Micron version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The latest iteration, the Elbrus 8CB, is fabbed on a 28-nanometer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   **Baikal CPUs:** Baikal Electronics adopted a modern approach, using EDA tools like Synopsis to develop ARM-based chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Their latest offering, the Baikal M series (an eight-core system-on-chip), is fabbed on a TSMC 28-nanometer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Baikal had plans to order over 200,000 pieces from TSMC in early 2021, though they faced issues securing fab capacity due to global chip shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Acquired by the Varton Group in 2021, Baikal announced plans to invest 23 billion rubles to expand into the server space, develop a 6-nanometer chip, and sell over half a million chips, mostly to government organizations meeting import substitution policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

## Overall Outlook and Broader Industrial Challenges

It is doubtful that the Russian semiconductor manufacturing industry will advance past 65-nanometers in the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

### Potential Alternatives and Their Limitations

Considering [[potential_russian_alternatives_for_semiconductor_sourcing | potential Russian alternatives for semiconductor sourcing]], Belarus and China come to mind.

*   **Belarus (Integral):** A significant portion of Soviet integrated circuit production was located in Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Integral was the third of the "big three" Soviet semiconductor manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. However, its most sophisticated node in 2017 was a 350-nanometer process, which first hit the market in 1993, making it not a viable alternative to a TSMC 28-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **China (SMIC):** Chinese semiconductor foundries, particularly Shanghai-based SMIC, might seem like a capable TSMC replacement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. SMIC's most advanced node is a 14-nanometer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Given warm relations between Russia and China, SMIC could be an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. However, [[challenges_and_advancements_in_chinese_semiconductor_industry | SMIC heavily relies on chip-making equipment imports]] from the Netherlands and Japan, which could pose future challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

### Broader Impact of Sanctions

In the short and medium term, the halt in shipments might not have a major impact due to Russia's stockpiles and the fact that "guns don't need a seven-nanometer chip" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. However, these sanctions will further hinder the country's industries, which already chronically lag their Western counterparts in digitization and modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Russia has significantly fewer industrial robots per employee than the world average (23 times fewer), and only a small percentage of its industry utilizes computer numerical control (CNC) machines (10%) or leverages data from installed sensors (1%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. These sanctions make it even harder for Russian businesses and individuals to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. The inability of the late Soviet communist party to close the widening technology gap contributed to a loss of confidence in its competency, and current circumstances present similar challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

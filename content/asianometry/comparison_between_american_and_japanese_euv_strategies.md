The development of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography was a long and complex process, ultimately leading to a shift of the semiconductor lithography industry towards Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This marked a significant loss for [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japan]], which had previously led the lithography industry but was unable to commercialize EUV in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The divergent paths of American and [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japanese]] EUV development offer a fascinating comparison of strategies and challenges.

## Early Assessments and Strategic Pivots

EUV was invented in [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japan]] in 1986 by Dr. Hiro Kinoshita at NTT, who successfully printed a circuit pattern using EUV light and a reflective optic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. However, at the time, EUV was just one of several potential next-generation lithography candidates, including Electron Beam direct write, proximity x-ray, and ion beam projection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### Japanese Initial Preference
The [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japanese]] lithography industry initially did not prioritize EUV, seeming to lean towards proximity x-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This assessment was shared by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), whose early EUV project was ending without industry follow-up, and as late as 1997, Sematech ranked EUV in fourth place, with x-ray in first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

### American Initiative
The American semiconductor leader Intel, after seeing demonstrations in [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japan]] and DOE labs, recognized the potential of EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. To prevent the disbandment of the DOE EUV Project R&D team, Intel provided bridge funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. A year later, in 1998, Intel and other American semiconductor manufacturers founded EUV LLC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, an industry-wide consortium designed to provide approximately $60 million per year for R&D to commercialize EUV lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

### Japanese Response
Intel's interest and the founding of EUV LLC caught the [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japanese]] by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. Due to American restrictions on foreign participation, [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japan]]'s lithography makers, Nikon and Canon, could not directly join EUV LLC, though they were permitted to participate in design reviews and working groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This forced the [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japanese]] to rapidly pivot and pursue their own development path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. In 1998, a year after EUV LLC's founding, [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japan]]'s Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched its own EUV lithography program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

## Organizational Structures and Funding

### American Centralization
The American EUV lithography project was characterized by a single entity, EUV LLC, overseeing early commercialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>. EUV LLC operated for six years, from 1997 to 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>, before transitioning the work to [[ASML and highvolume EUV systems | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. By its conclusion, the EUV LLC team had met its objectives and produced a working prototype, the engineering test stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>.

### Japanese Fragmentation
In contrast, the [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japanese]] EUV effort rapidly expanded beyond the capacity of a single research institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. By 2005, four distinct research consortia were focusing on different parts of the EUV machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>:
*   **ASET (Association of Super Advanced Electronic Technologies)**: A multi-year research consortium fully funded by MITI, focusing on basic technologies like optics manufacturing, multi-layer mirror masks, resist contamination control, and cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   **EUVA (Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography System Development Association)**: Founded in 2001, this organization included academia and industry (five equipment companies, four semiconductor manufacturers) and was responsible for the exposure tool's light source and some optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.
*   **Leading Project**: Handled inter-university collaboration related to light sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.
*   **Mirai**: Focused on mask defect control and detection subsystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.

This complicated setup contrasted sharply with the American approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japan]]'s overall EUV effort from 1999 to 2012 is estimated to have cost between $5 billion and $10 billion, a significant jump from the $150 million cost of the VLSI project in the late 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29:00">[24:29:00]</a>.

## Technological Focus and Challenges

Both programs shared information, with [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japan]] benefiting from observing the American path, though the Americans maintained a clear lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

### Light Source Development
[[Engineering challenges of the EUV light source | EUV light sources]] were a critical hurdle for both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
*   **Japanese Approach**: EUVA researched two approaches: laser-produced plasma (LPP) and discharge-produced plasma (DPP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. Nikon's EUV-1 prototype used a DPP contraption from Ushio and its subsidiary Extreme Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. The DPP approach was considered more power-efficient, smaller, and cleaner, but struggled to output sufficient power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>. The EUV-1's light source peaked at 100 Watts, far short of the eventual goal of 250 Watts for high-volume production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. This would require a system change to tin-based DPP, which also faced contamination and power issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.
*   **ASML's Choice**: [[ASML and highvolume EUV systems | ASML]] eventually chose the LPP approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. [[ASML and highvolume EUV systems | ASML]] also experimented with DPP but halted work on it in 2013, as sufficient power levels were only achieved with their laser double-shot method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>.

### Other Engineering Challenges
Both countries faced immense [[Engineering challenges of the EUV light source | engineering challenges]] across various subsystems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Optics**: ASET focused on optics manufacturing, including adding reflective multi-layers to mirrors and cleaning them, as well as metrology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
*   **Masks**: Producing defect-free photomasks was immensely difficult, with a target of 0.003 defects per square centimeter and a defect threshold of just a few nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. Traditional DUV light could not penetrate deep enough, requiring inspection with EUV light itself (actinic light) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. Mirai successfully produced an actinic blank inspection tool by 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>.
*   **Resist**: [[Impact of EUV technology on semiconductor fabrication | EUV light]]'s high absorbability meant traditional resist materials were too thick, necessitating the development of new thin layer imaging (TLI) technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japanese]] companies still hold dominant positions in EUV photoresist and related equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a>.
*   **Contamination Control**: Carbon contamination from EUV light hitting mirror surfaces was a persistent issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:00">[20:04:00]</a>. While oxygen and UV dry cleaning helped with carbon, [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japanese]] researchers struggled with a mysterious silicon carbon compound (cyloxane) contamination into 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:00">[20:45:00]</a>.

## Prototypes and Outcomes

### American Prototypes
The Americans, specifically Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratories working with Carl Zeiss, delivered their small field device, the Micro Exposure Tool (MET), in mid-2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

### Japanese Prototypes
In 2005, [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japan]] aimed for high-volume EUV lithography at the 45 nanometer process node by 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. This required a full EUV system by 2008 or 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.
*   **Canon**: Canon and EUVA completed their small field prototype, the SFET, in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. They intended to produce a full field six-mirror prototype, the VS2, starting in 2009 for completion in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00">[14:37:00]</a>. However, Canon struggled with core EUV problems like power levels, defect-free masks, and optic system lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>. The global financial crisis further impacted Canon, leading to the VS2 never being built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>. Canon now only sells KrF non-immersion lithography systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>.
*   **Nikon**: Nikon was the [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japanese]] leader, being the only producer of immersion lithography other than [[ASML and highvolume EUV systems | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:00">[15:44:00]</a>. From 2001 to 2004, Nikon worked with ASET on three iterations of their small field prototype, nicknamed Hina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>. In April 2006, Nikon began producing their first full field exposure tool, the six-mirror EUV-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>. This Alpha device was completed and installed at the SALTEC R&D Research Center, going live in January 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>. This put them about 1.5 years behind [[ASML and highvolume EUV systems | ASML]]'s Alpha Demo Tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>. The EUV-1, despite being Asia's most advanced lithography machine, was not commercially competitive due to its light source power output and contamination issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a>. The delay pushed the high-volume ship schedule from the 45nm node to the 32nm node, or even 28nm and 22nm, requiring even greater light source power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. Nikon's subsequent EUV2 was scheduled for 2011-2012, but [[ASML and highvolume EUV systems | ASML]]'s lead grew to 18 months or two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>. Nikon cut R&D budgets during the 2009 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:27:00">[21:27:00]</a>. The EUV3 was planned for 2012, targeting 16-11nm nodes by 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>. However, Intel's announcement in July 2012 of a $4 billion investment in [[ASML and highvolume EUV systems | ASML]] effectively signaled Intel's move away from Nikon as a cornerstone customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>. Nikon likely decided the investment wasn't worth it, and their EUV efforts quietly ceased, with the EUV3 never shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:59:00">[22:59:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
The American and [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japanese]] EUV strategies ultimately led to different outcomes. The American approach, characterized by a unified industry consortium (EUV LLC) and strategic funding, successfully passed the torch to [[ASML and highvolume EUV systems | ASML]], who would go on to commercialize high-volume EUV systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.

[[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japan]]'s efforts, despite early invention and substantial investment, were hampered by a fragmented organizational structure, initial misjudgment of EUV's importance, and the inability to resolve key technical challenges, particularly in light source power and contamination control, in a commercially viable timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>. The ultimate factor for [[japans_euv_development_programs_and_institutions | Japan]]'s failure was economics and competition, rather than insurmountable technological barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:00">[24:22:00]</a>.

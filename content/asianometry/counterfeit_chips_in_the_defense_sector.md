Counterfeit chips pose a significant risk in critical situations, as highlighted by a 2020 incident where an F-16 ejection seat malfunctioned, resulting in the pilot's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. An investigation of the seat's sequencer discovered several counterfeit or fake microchips, though their exact role in the incident remains unclear, especially since the sequencer also required maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This event underscores the pervasive problem of [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | counterfeit semiconductors]] within the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## [[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | Definitions and Types of Counterfeit Semiconductors]]

The term "counterfeit semiconductor" encompasses a broad range of definitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. A simple definition from the Department of Defense (DoD) outlines two main types:
*   A previously used electronic part sold as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   Unauthorized copies of an authentic electronic product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

For a more comprehensive understanding, the industry uses a detailed taxonomy where a semiconductor is considered counterfeit if:
1.  It is an unauthorized copy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
2.  It does not conform to the original manufacturer's design, model, or performance standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
3.  It is not produced by the original manufacturer or its authorized contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
4.  It is off-specification, already used, defective, or misleadingly labeled as new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
5.  It is incorrectly marked or has wrong documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## [[global_impact_and_statistics_on_counterfeit_electronics | Global Impact and Statistics on Counterfeit Electronics]]

Measuring the scale of the counterfeit semiconductor business is challenging due to its illegal nature and outdated data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Organizations often discuss it as part of a larger trend of piracy and counterfeiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. In 2019, the OECD estimated that the global volume of [[global_impact_and_statistics_on_counterfeit_electronics | counterfeit and pirated products]] accounted for up to 3.3% of total global trade, exceeding $500 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Specific data on counterfeit semiconductors:
*   **Government Industry Data Exchange Program (GIDEP)**: A government counterfeit parts database exists, but its non-anonymous nature deters victims from reporting incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Electronic Resellers Association International (ERAI)**: This corporation monitors incidents and issues reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   In 2022, ERAI noted 504 reported semiconductor counterfeit cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   This was a sharp drop from 963 in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
    *   In 2019, the number of cases was 963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **US Congressional Committee (2011)**: An investigation into counterfeit electronic parts in the military supply chain quoted an estimate from the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
    *   The SIA stated that counterfeiting cost the American semiconductor manufacturing industry over $7.5 billion annually in lost revenue and 11,000 jobs in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Bureau of Industry Security (2010)**: A Department of Commerce report identified 7,114 detected counterfeited microcircuit incidents across 387 companies within the defense industry in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This was a significant increase from 3,400 reported incidents in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

[[definitions_and_types_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | Counterfeited semiconductors]] span various types, including microprocessors, analog chips, memory, and radio frequency chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Their resale value can range from 11 cents to $500, with most falling into the 11 cents to $10 range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Incidents in the Military Supply Chain

The 2011 Senate panel hearing revealed multiple incidents where counterfeit semiconductors infiltrated military supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **P-8A Poseidon Incident**: A P-8A Poseidon aircraft experienced a malfunction in its ice detection module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The component controlling the module was labeled as a Xilinx FPGA unit, but it was counterfeit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Boeing discovered the fake part when it physically fell out of its socket and rattled inside the module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The module's manufacturer, BAE, had purchased 300 such FPGAs from a California company, which only tested 50 before reselling them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The counterfeit chip was traced back to an affiliate of an electronics manufacturer in Shenzhen, [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

Defense Department contractors and commercial system integrators frequently face the challenge of using old parts for repair and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. For example, the F-15 plane, introduced over 45 years ago, uses parts that original manufacturers stopped producing long ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This often forces them to acquire components from secondhand, sometimes questionable, suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Despite these [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | challenges]], the US government places the responsibility of [[detection_and_prevention_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | detecting and filtering out these counterfeit chips]] on the contractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. In January 2013, President Obama signed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) into law, which imposes civil and criminal penalties on contractors for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

*   **Vision Tech Case**: A notable case involved Vision Tech, a Florida-based company that knowingly sold fake chips as trademarked military-grade goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Vision Tech employees were instructed to misrepresent the origin of chips as Europe when they actually came from [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China]] and Hong Kong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. They also sent legitimate chips as samples but shipped fake ones for the actual purchased orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The company generated nearly $16 million in sales from these fraudulent activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. While the owner died before sentencing, the administrative manager received a 38-month prison sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## How Counterfeit Chips Enter the Supply Chain

### Recycling
Recycling is one of the most common avenues for counterfeit chips to enter the supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The typical process involves:
1.  Workers receiving scrap electronics and removing printed circuit boards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
2.  Heating circuit boards over an open flame to melt solder and loosen components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
3.  Bashing boards against a hard surface to dislodge components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
4.  Removing original markings from components using various methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
5.  Sorting, reprocessing, and applying new coats and markings to make chips appear new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

This process subjects already old and worn-out e-waste components to immense damage and stress, often rendering them non-functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Relabeling or Remarking
Relabeled or remarked chips are components whose markings have been altered to mislead users about their capabilities and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Markings typically indicate a chip's model, origin, and certifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Counterfeiters acquire chips, erase their original markings, and apply new ones to make them appear more premium or expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

This has serious consequences, especially for components requiring enhanced specifications, like military-grade chips hardened against radiation or temperature damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Suppliers might swap cheaper commercial parts that appear similar but do not meet the hardening requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Recycling and remarking account for approximately 80% of all counterfeiting incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Overproduction by Foundries
Most semiconductor companies (fabless) contract overseas foundries for chip production, often without third-party oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Some foundries may produce more chips than contracted for, either to boost reported yield or, more illicitly, to resell the excess production as counterfeits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This allows the foundry to profit from a valuable design without incurring the significant R&D costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. While reputable foundries are unlikely to risk their multi-billion dollar reputations, fabless manufacturers can implement measures to ensure their products are not illicitly sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Unauthorized Clones
Unauthorized clones are similar to foundry overproduction but originate from a third party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. These third parties clone chips to bypass the expensive R&D involved in developing their own designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Design IP for clones can be obtained through reverse engineering (e.g., using an electron microscope to analyze chip layers), which is more difficult for complex chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Alternatively, IP can be illegally acquired at various stages of the [[chip_design_process_and_techniques | chip design process and techniques]] and manufacturing process, such as copying RTL code from a design house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

Clone semiconductor counterfeits are harder to detect because they tend to be functionally similar to authentic products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. However, many cloned or reverse-engineered chips deviate from the original in technology and process, leading to erratic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

## [[detection_and_prevention_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | Detection and Prevention of Counterfeit Semiconductors]]

Counterfeit chips often enter products due to contractors lacking documented supply chain history or failing to conduct thorough inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. The P-8A Poseidon incident exemplifies this, where the California-based supplier should have more closely inspected the FPGAs from its [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | Chinese]] supplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Inspection Methods
Two main types of methods are used for inspecting potentially counterfeit chips:
1.  **Physical Methods**: These methods search for defects related to the chip's physical properties, including issues with the exterior, shipping/packaging, connections, IC packaging, bonding wires, or die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Techniques include:
    *   External Visual Inspection (EVI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
    *   More invasive methods like X-ray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
    *   De-capping the entire chip to expose its internal components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
    *   Some physical methods are destructive, limiting their universal application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
2.  **Electrical Methods**: These tests identify changes in a chip's component parameters (parametric tests) or confirm proper functionality (functional tests) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. While generally effective, they are also time-consuming and expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

[[detection_and_prevention_of_counterfeit_semiconductors | Detecting counterfeits]] presents a challenge of nuances, such as distinguishing normal physical defects from signs of sanding procedures used to remove previous markings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Organizations must balance detection effectiveness against financial and time constraints, opting for a set of tests that provide high confidence rather than seeking total assurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### Designed for Counterfeit Measures
With recycling a significant problem and package remarking becoming harder to detect, fabless designers can integrate new features into their [[chip_design_process_and_techniques | chip designs]] to aid in detection, known as designed for counterfeit measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Unique ID**: A simple approach is to program a unique ID into a non-programmable memory on the chip, which can be easily read throughout its lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Physical Unclonable Feature (PUF)**: This anti-counterfeiting design creates a unique "fingerprint" for the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. An example is an Arbiter PUF, which uses random variables from the semiconductor fabrication process to produce a circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. When a signal (a "challenge") is sent through the circuit, it produces a random but repeatable output, similar to a Google Authenticator app for two-step authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

Despite these advanced methods, counterfeits can still tamper with them, or their implementation might be prohibitively difficult due to cost, technical reasons, or lack of space on the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Blockchain proposals utilizing PUFs for supply chain traceability have been suggested, though their widespread acceptance and integration with existing measures are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Root Causes and Global Dynamics

The primary reason most counterfeit chips, especially recycled ones, enter the supply chain is the pervasive opportunity and incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   In 2019, only 17.4% of the world's electronic waste was documented as collected and recycled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This e-waste is often harvested to produce fake semiconductor components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   Harvesting and desoldering old chips from e-waste can cost as little as 10 cents per chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
*   Certain types of chips can sell for $1 to $10 each, meaning a fake recycled chip can yield up to 100 times its harvesting cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This significant profit margin incentivizes illicit labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

The problem is exacerbated by massive imports of improperly managed e-waste from developed regions like the United States and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

Historically, throughout the 2010s, most fake recycled and relabeled chips originated from [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China]] because that was where the majority of e-waste was sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. However, in 2017, [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China]] banned the import of 24 types of solid waste, including plastic and e-waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. While some e-waste is still smuggled into [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China]], significant imports have redirected to new countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. For example, Thailand saw a 5.7 times increase in e-waste imports in 2017 following [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China's]] ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

The modern world relies on semiconductors to function properly, whether in military equipment, aircraft, or automobiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. A chip that does not meet its stated specifications can cause serious harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

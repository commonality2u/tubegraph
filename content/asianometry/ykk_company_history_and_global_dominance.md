YKK, which stands for Yoshida Kogyo Kabushiki Geisha (roughly translating to Yoshida Manufacturing Company), is one of the world's leading zipper manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Despite not inventing the modern zipper, YKK now holds approximately 90% of the Japanese market and 40% of the world market by value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## [[history_and_evolution_of_the_zipper | The Invention of the Modern Zipper]]

The device, also known as a slide fastener, is used to join and bind the edges of two fabrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The modern slide fastener was invented by Com Judson in 1891, primarily to simplify the buttoning and unbuttoning of high-button boots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Judson, an engineer focused on pneumatic public transit systems, developed the zipper as a side project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Judson's business partners quickly recognized the product's potential and established a company to sell it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This company underwent several ownership changes and transformations, eventually becoming [[comparison_between_ykk_and_competitors_like_talon_and_fujian_sps_zipper | Talon Inc.]], the original zipper company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Key Developments by Talon

Twenty years later, Talon hired Swedish-American electrical engineer Gideon Sundback, who became their head engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Sundback spent years improving the fastener design for reliability and manufacturability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. In 1917, he patented the "Hookless Number Two," which featured the interlocking teeth structure seen in modern zippers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Crucially, Sundback also invented a machine capable of efficiently producing this design, which was vital for its widespread adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Initially, Talon struggled to gain adoption from textile companies, with the zipper primarily used in military items like soldiers' belts, life vests, and sleeping bags during World War I, as well as tobacco bags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. The term "zipper" wasn't used until 1923, when B.F. Goodrich used it for a rubber boot product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This boot significantly boosted zipper demand, leading Talon's factory to focus solely on zipper production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Talon was displeased with the generic trademark "zipper" and unsuccessfully tried to promote "Talon" as the brand name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

Despite the success of the zipper boot, Talon faced challenges in getting garment manufacturers to incorporate zippers due to higher cost, limited color options, and concerns about weight and integration into workflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Talon strategically targeted women's girdles and men's work clothing, offered home sewing kits, hired a sales force, and held zipper-themed fashion shows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. These efforts gradually paid off, with Talon producing over 200 million zippers by 1939 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## The Origins of YKK

Tadao Yoshida, YKK's founder, was born in 1908 in Uozu City, Toyama prefecture, Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Growing up poor, he started small businesses to earn money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. At 15, he could not continue his studies and worked at a rubber boot shop while self-studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

In 1928, at age 20, Yoshida moved to Tokyo with 70 yen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. He found a job at Furia Shoten, an import store selling Chinese ceramics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. When the Japan-China war made Chinese ceramic imports impossible, the store shifted to selling slide fasteners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The store eventually closed, and Furia suggested Yoshida take over the remaining zipper inventory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

In January 1934, the 25-year-old Yoshida founded San S Shokai, utilizing Furia's zipper inventory and striking a deal with an Osaka zipper maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. At the time, over half of zippers were defective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Yoshida prioritized quality control, even testing zippers with a hammer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. To ensure better quality, his shop began producing its own zippers, building a metal factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This factory was destroyed by Allied bombing in March 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

After Japan's defeat, Yoshida returned to Uozu City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. He met an American considering exporting Japanese products, but the American found Yoshida's zippers of inferior quality and too expensive compared to US fasteners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## [[technical_aspects_and_manufacturing_process_of_zippers | Zipper Components and Manufacturing]]

A zipper consists of three main components: the tape, the teeth (elements), and the slider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The teeth intermesh to open and close the zipper, forming a chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The slider moves along the teeth to lock or unlock them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The tape is the fabric part to which the teeth are attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Manufacturing a metal zipper begins with pre-made Y-shaped metal wire, often a copper-zinc alloy for rust resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. A tiny chip is sheared off the wire's end to become an element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. A hook-like protrusion (scoop) is forged into the element to catch the teeth and keep them together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Finally, the tooth is attached to the tape by bending the element's two legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## [[ykks_strategy_of_vertical_integration_and_market_adaptation | YKK's Strategic Innovations and Growth]]

Yoshida understood that mechanical automation was essential for economical and effective zipper production, as poor quality could ruin a garment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. He saw American-made chain machines, costing $30,000-$40,000, as critical for achieving the desired quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. In 1949, after significant effort, he secured an import license and a 12 million yen loan to acquire four chain machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

These machines, which arrived in 1950, gave YKK an immense competitive advantage, allowing six workers to do the work of 160 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Yoshida immediately commissioned a Japanese company to produce 100 replicas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. YKK further improved the machines in 1953, enabling them to attach teeth at regular time intervals, eliminating the need for spacers and greatly speeding up manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Further enhancements made the machines easier to operate by a single person and increased production volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### [[ykks_strategy_of_vertical_integration_and_market_adaptation | Vertical Integration]]

Yoshida and YKK strongly believed in [[ykks_strategy_of_vertical_integration_and_market_adaptation | vertical integration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. In 1954, Yoshida began work on the Kurobe Factory, an integrated campus designed to produce everything from the metal wire to the textiles for the zipper tapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This philosophy extended to YKK's overseas operations; for example, the YKK USA Factory melts its own brass, creates its own polyester, and weaves its own zipper tapes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Yoshida reasoned that controlling raw material production provided advantages in developing new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

YKK's automation capabilities, its ability to manufacture its own production machines, and its control over the entire supply chain contributed to its market leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. By 1958, YKK was producing enough zippers to encircle the entire Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## YKK's Global Dominance and Talon's Decline

[[comparison_between_ykk_and_competitors_like_talon_and_fujian_sps_zipper | Talon's]] decline and YKK's ascent accelerated around 1975 when Talon and its trade association failed to persuade the American government to restrict foreign zipper imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Talon's market share, 70% in 1971, plummeted to 35% by 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

However, YKK's rise wasn't solely due to import policies. YKK had already sought entry into the US market as early as 1955 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. By 1960, they began importing zipper parts for final assembly on American soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. In 1974, a year before Talon's failed petition, YKK opened a [[ykks_strategy_of_vertical_integration_and_market_adaptation | vertically integrated]] factory in Macon, Georgia, which remains operational and has recently expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. YKK zippers produced there are marked as "made in the United States" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

YKK strategically followed textile manufacturers as they moved to low-cost labor locations worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Today, YKK operates factories in 71 countries, building locally to overcome tariff barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### Talon's Missteps

[[comparison_between_ykk_and_competitors_like_talon_and_fujian_sps_zipper | Talon's]] decline was also exacerbated by internal factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. In 1968, industrial conglomerate Textron acquired Talon for $200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Talon's new owners, being brand managers rather than textile experts, lacked the necessary experience to compete with foreign rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Talon lost market share in industrial garments, with its main profitable business shrinking as more women entered the workforce and bought ready-made clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. They also failed to adapt to new fashion trends emphasizing freer, more colorful clothing made from stretchier synthetic fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

In contrast, YKK offered new zippers that capitalized on these trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>:
*   **Concealed zipper**: This innovation hid the teeth by blending into the garment, a long-requested feature by manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Plastic injection mold zippers**: These could be dyed into vibrant colors, appealing to the flashy fashions of the era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

Textron eventually sold Talon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. The company has since been owned by various private equity firms and is currently held by a [[hong_kongs_manufacturing_history | Hong Kong]] company, Tag It Pacific Inc., with most of its production now based in Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## Modern Zipper Market and Competition

Today, the zipper market is segmented into high, middle, and low ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **High-end luxury**: Dominated by European brands like Switzerland's Riri and Italy's Lampo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **Low-end**: Dominated by manufacturers in China or India competing primarily on price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

YKK makes about 80% of its roughly $6 billion annual revenue in the middle to high-end fashion markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. However, YKK faces significant competition in this segment from [[comparison_between_ykk_and_competitors_like_talon_and_fujian_sps_zipper | Fujian SPS Zipper]] from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. Founded in 1984, Fujian SPS Zipper, led by Kang, started as a middleman but aggressively expanded into producing cheap but high-quality zippers for mid-fashion garment manufacturers like Zara, Target, and Michael Kors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Fujian SPS Zipper generates about $300 million USD, presenting a direct challenge to YKK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

In response, YKK is focusing on producing higher-quality luxury zippers while also aggressively expanding its operations in China to compete on Fujian SPS's home turf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. The evolution of the zipper and YKK's journey demonstrate the technological sophistication and R&D involved in manufacturing, often taken for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

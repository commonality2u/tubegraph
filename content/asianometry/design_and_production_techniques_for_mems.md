Microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS, are microsystems that combine both electric and mechanical functions. These are built using the same advanced techniques used to create today's integrated circuits (ICs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Despite their miraculous technology, the [[economic_challenges_in_the_mems_industry | MEMS industry]] has faced significant economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.

## Historical Context and Early Developments
The concept of making things incredibly small has been a long-held dream. In 1959, Richard Feynman delivered a lecture at Caltech titled "There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom," where he discussed directly manipulating atoms to create useful tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. He even offered a prize for a tiny motor, which was claimed by a Caltech engineer, though it was made using conventional tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

The first true MEMS product emerged in 1967 when Harvey Nathanson at Westinghouse developed the resonant gate transistor using pre-modern micro machining techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. This one-millimeter-long gold transistor was unique because it could move, allowing researchers to control the distance between the gate and electrode with electricity. Its ability to respond to a narrow range of input signals made it useful as a frequency filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

MEMS technology gained significant traction in 1979 when Hewlett Packard utilized [[engineering_and_manufacturing_of_silicon_wafers | silicon]] micro machining to develop a printer inkjet nozzle, enabling thermal inkjet technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. This became one of the most successful applications of the technology up to that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### Thermal Inkjet Technology
Thermal inkjet technology functions by rapidly heating ink to approximately 100 degrees Celsius, which creates tiny bubbles that push ink through a micro machined nozzle onto paper. When these bubbles collapse, a vacuum is created, drawing in more ink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. While the nozzles themselves don't move, MEMS technology was crucial in their creation, and their minute size allowed HP to integrate many of them, thereby enhancing printer resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Major Applications and Design Innovations
In the 1990s, the MEMS industry found another significant commercial use with sensors for acceleration, pressure, and direction, which are valuable in industrial, medical, and electronics sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

### Automotive Airbag Sensors
Analog Devices developed the first commercial acceleration MEMS sensor in 1991, which was less than one square centimeter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This sensor featured capacitive sense fingers, about 60 microns deep, attached to a mass. When acceleration occurs, the mass moves, changing the capacitive value of the fingers, which is then sensed by the chip and relayed to the relevant electronic control unit (ECU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Analog Devices integrated this accelerometer and its accompanying electronics onto a single [[engineering_and_manufacturing_of_silicon_wafers | silicon chip]], the ADXL50, capable of sensing accelerations up to 50 gs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. This monolithic system was smaller, more reliable, and significantly cheaper ($5 compared to $20-$100 for older systems), contributing to the widespread adoption of airbags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Modern cars now incorporate dozens of MEMS-based sensors for systems like anti-lock brakes, active suspension, navigation control, and rollover detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

### Medical Pressure Sensors
Pressure sensors became another major MEMS application, used in hospitals to monitor blood pressure via intravenous lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>. Early external sensors were expensive ($600+) and required sterilization and recalibration for reuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. The MEMS version, costing only ten dollars (with most cost in packaging for disposability), revolutionized medical use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

Mechanically, MEMS pressure sensors are relatively simple:
1.  [[engineering_and_manufacturing_of_silicon_wafers | Silicon]] is crafted into a thin membrane that acts as a diaphragm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.
2.  Four small stress-sensitive polysilicon resistors (piezo resistors) are placed along the diaphragm's edges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
3.  The diaphragm is suspended over a vacuum cavity to form an absolute pressure sensor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
4.  When pressure is applied, it changes the [[engineering_and_manufacturing_of_silicon_wafers | silicon]] band structure, altering the crystal's resistivity, which is then sensed and transmitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

The medical MEMS sensor industry is now valued at over six billion dollars, with blood pressure sensors forming the largest segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

### Inertial Sensors in Consumer Electronics
Manufacturers have expanded on initial pressure sensor and accelerometer designs to create versatile, low-power inertial MEMS-based sensors found in modern consumer electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. For example, the Nintendo Switch console and controllers contain ultra-low power inertial sensors with gyroscope and accelerometer capabilities (e.g., STMicroelectronics SH-627) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. MEMS micro machining technologies are also used in visual displays and optical switches, where micro mirrors redirect light between optical fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

## MEMS Production Workflows and Techniques
The core idea behind most commercial MEMS production is to leverage high-volume IC techniques, such as photolithography and etching, to add or remove layers on a 2D substrate, ultimately forming a 3D shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. However, there isn't a universal "one-size-fits-all" methodology for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

Other micro machining methods employed for more economical MEMS production include:
*   **Electrochemical Micro Machining (ECM)**: Originally for low-end PC boards, ECM can create MEMS by locally and selectively etching metals with an electrode tip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.
*   **Laser Beam Machining** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>
*   **Electrode Discharge Machining** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>
*   **LIGA** (a German acronym for Lithographie, Galvanoformung, Abformung â€“ Lithography, Electroplating, and Molding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>

## Design Challenges in MEMS
While MEMS shares commonalities with integrated circuits, there are fundamental differences, particularly in [[chip_design_process_and_techniques | design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. Designing MEMS is a specialized field, as simply miniaturizing macroscopic devices doesn't work. For instance, at the micro scale, friction forces are significantly stronger than inertia, and tiny flow spaces are highly susceptible to fluid blockages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. Conversely, certain biochips can use electro-osmotic effects, possible only at a micrometer scale, to pump reactants around the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

There are also fundamental philosophical differences between semiconductor and mechanical [[chip_design_process_and_techniques | design]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>:
*   **Modularity vs. Customization**: Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) revolutionized semiconductor [[chip_design_process_and_techniques | design]] by enabling a modular approach. Entire systems and chips can be built by combining parts from generic modules and standardized cell libraries, which are designed independently of the final product, often in conjunction with the production process (e.g., TSMC's nodes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. In contrast, the mechanical [[chip_design_process_and_techniques | design]] world lacks such a standardized library, with the exception of basic components like bolts or pipe fittings made by subcontractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. Mechanical components must be custom-tailored to accommodate specific weight, space, and energy restrictions of the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.
*   **Functionality**: VLSI objects primarily process signals, usually logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. Mechanical objects, including MEMS, often need to contain liquids, rotate, slide, or support loads, sometimes all simultaneously, making their [[chip_design_process_and_techniques | design]] extremely custom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

Despite these challenges, companies like CoventorWare and IntelliCAD are developing CAD and [[chip_design_process_and_techniques | design]] automation software suites for the MEMS industry, which help designers better understand microstructure [[chip_design_process_and_techniques | design]] and electromechanical behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

## Production and Packaging
Testing and packaging are critical "back-end" steps in the semiconductor production process, transforming a finished die into a usable chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. For MEMS-based sensors, packaging accounts for 75-80% of the final cost, a significant reversal from integrated chips where packaging is secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. For example, a raw MEMS die from a foundry for an HVAC pressure sensor might cost less than 50 cents, but the final packaged product is priced at $20-$30, with most of that cost stemming from packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.

The fundamental reason for this cost difference is that while an IC is a self-contained system (its packaging serves to protect and interface it with the outside world), a MEMS device must intimately interact with its external environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>. A pressure sensor MEMS, for instance, cannot be encased in hard plastic because it needs to sense pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. Consequently, the packaging for each MEMS die must be customized for its specific application (e.g., pressure sensor MEMS requires different packaging than a micro mirror array or a microfluidic MEMS), adding substantial cost and engineering effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>.

Analog Devices, an early investor in MEMS, built an in-house manufacturing facility for their miniaturized accelerometers but it took nine years to become profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. Despite marketing their products with a price advantage, they had to agree to automatic price declines (e.g., from $11 to $6 per unit over six years for their first automotive sensor deal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

Yield is the single biggest factor influencing product cost; a 10% yield means 9 out of 10 products are unusable. Doubling the yield halves the cost, but this is difficult to achieve, leading to overly optimistic projections and market prices that do not reflect the significant investment in [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | development]], production, packaging, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>. Relentless market price erosion (3-5% quarterly) further erodes margins and discourages investment in new possibilities like micropropulsion for cube satellites, MEMS-based lidar mirrors for autonomous cars, or IoT sensors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Often called the "second [[engineering_and_manufacturing_of_silicon_wafers | silicon]] revolution," MEMS technology is still considered "magic" due to its ability to create microscopic moving parts that perform functions of much larger systems, making them smaller, cheaper, and more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. However, the industry's very creativity and diversity have made it difficult to establish widespread standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. Unlike the IC industry with organizations like Sematech or DARPA, MEMS lacks a guiding body to map a way forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. For the industry to fully realize its technical and commercial potential, designers, foundries, vendors, and end-users (estimated to be around 50 entities) need to collaborate more closely to set standards and address under-invested issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>.

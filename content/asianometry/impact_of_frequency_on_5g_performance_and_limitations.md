5G represents a significant transition in wireless technology, with one of its key promises being the immense bandwidth and super-fast speeds offered by [[Antenna design and path loss in mmWave technology | Millimeter-Wave]] (mmWave) technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While fascinating, its rollout has faced [[Challenges of MillimeterWave 5G deployment | difficult technical and economic challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Fundamentals of Wireless Communication
A wave traveling through space has a wavelength, which is the distance it travels in a single cycle, measured in meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Frequency, measured in hertz, describes how many cycles pass through a given point per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Frequency and wavelength are inversely related: as frequencies rise, wavelengths fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For example, gamma rays are high-frequency waves with wavelengths measured in picometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Spectrum, the range of frequencies used for various applications like radar or wireless, is fundamentally limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Previous wireless generations (1G through 4G) primarily used frequency bands below 7.125 gigahertz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Over the years, these bands became very crowded, with cell operators typically having only about 200 megahertz of spectrum to work with, which was insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## 5G's Frequency Flexibility
The design of 5G aimed to address capacity constraints and enable new types of communication beyond enhanced mobile broadband, such as ultra-reliable low-latency networking (URLLC) and Massive Machine Type Communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. These diverse goals necessitated a more flexible standard, particularly in the frequency bands it could use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. For the first time, 5G opened up new slices of the spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Introduction of Millimeter-Wave
In 2011, researchers from Samsung Electronics suggested exploring the largely unexplored mmWave regions, pointing to bands in the 70/80/90 gigahertz range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. These are called millimeter wave bands because their wavelengths are in the 1-10 millimeter range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The FCC opened these bands for new economic development in 2003, though previously they were used for military radars, satellite communications, or cellular back-haul (point-to-point connections) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Early consumer use cases included automotive radar (77 GHz) and the WiGig WiFi standard (60 GHz) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. By 2014, research demonstrated the technical feasibility of bringing mmWave to consumer wireless applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Ultimately, 5G gained support for a set of mmWave bands in the 24.25 to 52.6 gigahertz range, in addition to more traditional sub-7 gigahertz bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## [[Technical aspects of Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits RFICs | RFICs]] and Upconversion for High Frequencies
[[Technical aspects of Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits RFICs | Radio Frequency Integrated Circuits]] (RFICs) are crucial for handling these frequencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. When a phone sends data, the RFIC converts digital bits into a continuous analog signal called the "baseband" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Since baseband signals are low frequency, they would require impractically large antennas for a phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. To address this, the RFIC uses a mixer to combine the baseband signal with a higher "carrier frequency" signal, a process known as "upconversion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. This creates a "passband" signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The carrier frequency is chosen by the cell operator based on allocations and wireless technology standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

The actual data is encoded in "sidebands" (small bands of frequencies higher and/or lower than the carrier frequency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The total slice of frequency, from the lowest to the highest sideband, is called the bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. A higher carrier frequency, like that of mmWave, yields more bandwidth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. For example, 10% of 25 gigahertz is significantly more than 10% of 7 gigahertz, meaning more data capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Path Loss and [[Antenna design and path loss in mmWave technology | Antenna Design]]
As a signal propagates outwards from a device, its power density dilutes, a phenomenon known as "path loss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Path loss contributes significantly to "attenuation," the gradual reduction of signal strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. According to the Friis equation, path loss is proportional to the wavelength squared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This implies that higher frequency waves (with shorter wavelengths) would travel less effectively than lower frequency ones, leading to 100 times worse path loss when moving from 3 gigahertz to 30 gigahertz if using identically sized antennas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

However, a key advantage of mmWave is that its smaller wavelengths allow for smaller antennas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This enables the use of antenna arrays, where many antennas (sometimes as many as 32) can be stuffed into the same space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. These arrays can generate directional beams aimed at the tower or base station, and vice versa, helping to mitigate the severe path loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

## [[Challenges of MillimeterWave 5G deployment | Limitations of mmWave Frequencies]]
One of the most significant limitations of mmWave is its inability to easily penetrate objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Buildings, foliage, and even the human body can attenuate the signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Bricks, trees, and outdoor tinted glass are particularly effective at attenuating mmWave signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Even turning away from a base station can drastically reduce performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. This means mmWave works best in areas with "line of sight," such as sports arenas, malls, and airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

### Densification Challenges
The limited range and penetration of mmWave signals necessitate a "densification" strategy for deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Unlike 1G through 4G, which used large macro-cells with ranges of several kilometers, mmWave requires installing many small cells, perhaps as little as 50-100 meters apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. This poses significant challenges, including acquiring numerous 5G sites, ensuring 24/7 power availability, securing back-haul connections to the larger network, maintaining aesthetic inconspicuousness, and navigating environmental permitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Telecoms have considered using reflectors on billboards or exterior glass to bounce mmWave signals, potentially saving money on site acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

## [[Deployment strategies of 5G in the United States | 5G Deployment and Frequency Bands]]
The 5G New Radio standard supports three sets of bands: low, mid, and high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **Low and Mid Bands**: Between 410 megahertz and 7.1 gigahertz, these offer good coverage but weaker capacity, often not significantly different from 4G LTE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   **High Band (mmWave)**: This is where the most capacity and data rates are promised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. However, deploying it is the most challenging due to its propagation and densification requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

Telecoms can deploy 5G using "Standalone" (a completely new 5G network) or "Non-standalone" options (using a 5G New Radio connected to a 4G LTE core) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Non-standalone offers some speed improvements but is not as significant, especially at lower bands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.

### [[Deployment strategies of 5G in the United States | United States Deployment Experience]]
In the United States, Verizon and AT&T initially focused on mmWave 5G because their legacy 3G and 4G networks occupied the low and mid-band frequencies, making high bands a "green field territory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Verizon began deploying Non-Standalone 5G for mobile and fixed wireless access in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

However, the mmWave mobile rollout faced challenges. Despite the US version of the iPhone 12 supporting mmWave in late 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>, analysts' expectations for mmWave carrying 5% of mobile traffic in 2021 were missed, with only 2.9% consumed in US urban areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. Studies found that slight movement could cause phones to fall back to 4G LTE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. This raised skepticism about achieving a good return on investment for large city coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

Wall Street's dissatisfaction and the success of T-Mobile's low and mid-band 5G deployments led Verizon and AT&T to adjust their strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. In February 2021, they acquired licenses for 5G mid-band spectrum in the "C-band" (3.7 gigahertz), with Verizon spending over $45 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Since then, their focus has shifted to expanding mid-band offerings, including standalone 5G networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. Device support for mmWave remains limited, primarily to US iPhones, with iPads even dropping support entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

## Conclusion
While telecoms continue to expand mmWave, it is mostly for fixed wireless access in rural areas and high-density urban areas like airports and sports stadiums, where its line-of-sight characteristics work best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. A "super-compelling, super-broad killer app" for mmWave has not yet emerged, and many "internet of things" and "industry 4.0" initiatives that 5G was expected to facilitate have not materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. Outside the United States, most of the world has not embraced mmWave, with Japan being a notable exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. The FCC is exploring creative solutions to utilize the largely unused mmWave spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. Technology continues to evolve, and while telecoms move towards Standalone 5G, the future progression and benefit for mmWave remain to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

Indonesia is the world's second-biggest consumer of instant noodles, with 14.5 billion servings consumed in 2023, and 99% of its 285 million people having eaten it at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Despite the area not being particularly known for wheat, instant noodles have become a staple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A surprising market for Indonesian noodles, particularly the Indomie brand, is Nigeria, where it is likely the single most popular packaged food in all of Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Beginnings in Indonesia

The origins of Indomie are deeply tied to Indonesia's economic and political landscape, particularly during the era of President Suharto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Suharto often partnered with Chinese entrepreneurs to industrialize the economy and finance his activities, leading to significant wealth for these entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The most prominent among them was Liem Sioe Liong, also known as Sudono Salim, and his Salim Group business group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

In 1967, Suharto's request for rice aid from the US government resulted in wheat being sent instead, as rice was scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Indonesia lacked milling facilities, necessitating the wheat to be milled in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Sudono Salim, despite knowing nothing about wheat, partnered with Malaysian Chinese tycoon Robert Kuok to establish Bogasari Flour Mills in 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Bogasari quickly became Indonesia's dominant flour miller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Kuok's 25% share in Bogasari was later lost when Salim merged Bogasari into his Indocement company, which displeased Kuok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Instant Noodles and Indomie's Consolidation

[[history_of_instant_noodles_in_indonesia | Instant noodles]] were first popularized by Momofuku Ando, who pioneered the flash-frying method and founded Nissin in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. In the same year, Indonesian entrepreneur Djajadi Djaja founded Indomie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Unlike its competitor Supermi, which launched earlier with Japanese technical help and used imported flour, Indomie sourced its flour locally and cheaply from Bogasari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

During a rice shortage in the late 1970s, the Indonesian government requested Bogasari to promote and provide alternative foods like flour-based products for its military and civil officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Bogasari acquired machinery for 2 billion packs of instant noodles annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. However, the rice shortage reversed in the 1980s due to agricultural advancements, leaving Bogasari with excess capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

To utilize this capacity, Bogasari launched its own instant noodle brand, Sarimi, directly competing with Indomie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Sarimi quickly captured 40% of the market due to low production costs from its integrated milling business and a $10 million marketing campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. In 1984, Djajadi Djaja merged Indomie with Sarimi, creating a joint venture called Indofood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Indofood later acquired Supermi, consolidating the Indonesian instant noodle market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The Salim Group eventually acquired full ownership of Indofood from Djajadi, who later sued, claiming he was forced to sell due to debt, though the Supreme Court decided against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This consolidation reflects the [[crony_capitalism_and_its_role_in_building_indonesias_largest_business_empire | crony capitalism]] prevalent in Indonesia's business empire building.

In 1982, Indomie launched its soup-less "Mi Goreng" version, which became an instant hit due to its ease of preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. By 1994, Indofood controlled about 80% of the Indonesian instant noodles market through its three brands: Indomie (60%), Supermi, and Sarimi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Indomie is cheap, easy to cook, tastes great, and offers over 110 flavors, with Mi Goreng being the most popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Its halal status is also crucial in Indonesia, the worldâ€™s largest Muslim population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Global Reach and Success in Africa

In the late 1980s, Indomie began its international expansion, initially through Indonesian foreign workers bringing it abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Indofood later formalized this expansion by partnering with local companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Indomie achieved significant success in the Middle East and Africa, where its halal status likely contributed to its acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. In Saudi Arabia, Indomie holds over 95% of the instant noodle market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. A factory in Syria has even remained operational throughout the civil war, providing affordable food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Indomie in Nigeria: A Strategic Partnership

Nigeria is Africa's most populous country, and despite its cuisine not traditionally featuring wheat-based noodles, Nigerians consumed approximately 3 billion servings of instant noodles in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The [[indomie_brand_success_in_nigeria | Indomie brand success in Nigeria]] is largely attributed to a partnership with the Tolaram Corporation.

### The Tolaram Corporation's Journey to Nigeria
The Tolaram Corporation's journey began in the 1920s when Khanchand Vaswani traveled from British India to Indonesia for trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. After the Partition of India in 1947, his family fled to Mumbai and eventually settled in Surabaya, Indonesia, in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. In 1950, Vaswani's textile shop became the Tolaram Corporation, expanding into chain retail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Tolaram grew by sourcing products in bulk, giving them a price advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. In 1975, they moved their headquarters to Singapore to better support international trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

In 1977, Mohan Vaswani, Khanchand's son, decided to establish operations in Nigeria due to its high population, relatively higher per capita income, and lack of consumer electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Tolaram became one of the first Singaporean companies to do business in Nigeria, trading electronics, textiles, and fishing nets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Despite Nigeria being under military rule and facing a foreign exchange crisis in the early 1980s, Tolaram invested for the long term, with its first textile factory in Nigeria losing money for nearly nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

### Indomie's Entry and [[cultural_adaptation_of_food_products | Cultural Adaptation]]
In 1988, Tolaram began importing Indomie noodles into Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. The idea came from Haresh Aswani, who observed Indomie's success in Indonesia and believed it could be replicated in Nigeria, citing similarities in population demographics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

Initial efforts faced significant challenges as Nigerians were unfamiliar with the product, mistaking the noodles for worms and not knowing how to eat or cook them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Tolaram positioned Indomie as a food for children, targeting busy mothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. They launched extensive educational marketing campaigns, hiring people to demonstrate cooking methods in supermarkets, schools, and even during traffic jams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Despite these efforts, sales volumes were slow for the first six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### Local Production and Market Dominance
Committed to the product, Tolaram decided to localize production to cut down on freight costs, which accounted for 40% of the product's cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. In 1995, a joint venture with Indofood created De United Foods, granting Tolaram the right to manufacture, brand, and sell Indomie noodles across West Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

The venture continued to lose money for several years, leading Indofood to consider pulling out, but Tolaram persevered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. In June 2000, the launch of a new "Onion Chicken" flavor, coupled with a massive marketing promotion, proved to be a turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. This flavor, along with "Pepper Chicken" and "Jollof," propelled Indomie to become the most popular noodle brand in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

It took 10 years for Indomie noodles to become profitable in Nigeria and 12 years to exceed $10 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. After that, sales doubled annually, reaching 40 million noodle packs per month by 2004 and a billion packs per month by 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Today, there are over half a dozen Indomie plants across Africa, serving Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt, and Eswatini, maintaining Indomie's dominance despite increasing competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## Tolaram's Evolution into a Consumer Giant

Indomie's success starting in 2000 prompted Tolaram to shift its strategic focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. The [[impact_of_the_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | Asian Financial Crisis of 1997]] and China's rise convinced Tolaram that B2B commodity products had limited future, leading them to scale down existing businesses like electronics assembly and textiles to prioritize consumer brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

This pivot required significant investment and vertical integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. Facing raw ingredient shortages, Tolaram established its own packaging plants, seasoning plants, flour mills, and oil mills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Given Nigeria's poor infrastructure (e.g., only 18% of roads paved, 75% of trains non-functional), Tolaram also had to provide basic utilities like electricity, water, and waste processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

Tolaram's long-term commitment and operational experience in Nigeria, especially through its formidable distribution company Multipro, have made it an attractive platform for other global consumer brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. This led to joint ventures with:
*   **Kellogg** (2015) for breakfast cereals and snacks in West Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   **Arla** (Danish-Swedish dairy cooperative) for dairy products in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
*   **Colgate-Palmolive** (2019) for dental health products in the Nigerian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   **Guinness Nigeria Brewery** (June 2024), acquiring a majority stake from Diageo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

Beyond consumer goods, the Tolaram Group has also invested in West Africa's largest infrastructure and real estate projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. In 2019, they raised approximately a billion dollars to build the Lekki Deep Sea Port near Lagos, capable of handling large container ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Tolaram aims to make this port the core of a larger industrial ecosystem called the Lagos Free Zone, a privately owned free trade zone for foreign companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. This demonstrates a fascinating business trajectory driven by the initial success of instant noodles.

[[computational_lithography_advancements | Inverse Lithography Technology]] (ILT) is a [[Role of technology and innovation in lithography | Resolution Enhancement Technique]] (RET) aimed at improving the resolution of chip design image transfer during lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:56">[08:52:56]</a>. Unlike traditional [[computational_lithography_advancements | Optical Proximity Correction]] (OPC), ILT takes an "inverse" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:38">[09:38:38]</a>.

## How ILT Works

Traditional OPC operations flow from the mask to the resist-coated wafer, starting with a design and making changes based on simulated models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:03">[09:03:03]</a>. ILT, however, conceptually works the other way around: from the wafer to the mask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. The process begins with the desired pattern for the wafer, and then determines the best mask design to achieve that pattern, considering how light travels through the lithography machine and interacts with the resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. ILT constructs the entire mask from scratch, pixel by pixel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

Professor B.E.A. Saleh of the University of Wisconsin-Madison first proposed the concepts of ILT in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. He initially used a variant of "simulated annealing," a statistical optimization technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. This involved creating a randomly generated mask and then making random changes to certain pixels ("flipping pixels"), keeping what worked and discarding what didn't to discover a local optimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

## Development and Adoption

After Saleh's paper, researchers at Berkeley, IBM, and other organizations refined the technique through experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

*   **Luminescent Technologies**: In 2003, a startup named Luminescent Technologies gained significant attention with their paper, "Fast Inverse Lithography Technology," giving ILT its current name and advocating for its adoption across the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.
*   **Intel**: Intel has funded academic research in this field since the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. In 2007, Intel presented its own version of ILT, which they called pixelated mask technology, avoiding the "ILT" name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.

## Characteristics and Benefits

ILT produces mask designs that are highly unintuitive, often appearing as "horrific mutations" of the original design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. Despite their appearance, ILT results often show:
*   Greater accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>
*   Higher fidelity to the desired pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>
*   More room for process error compared to model-based OPC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>

## Bottlenecks and Challenges

Despite its advantages, ILT faced substantial tradeoffs that limited its early adoption:

1.  **Computational Power and Throughput**: Accounting for every pixel in a chip design, though leading to optimal solutions, requires immense computing power or time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>. Some designs could take weeks to process, which was impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.
2.  **Mask Manufacturing**: Photomasks are typically written using focused electron beams, a slow but precise process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. Most masks feature "Manhattan geometry" (shapes made of rectangles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. However, masks generated by ILT often have free-form, curvilinear shapes with complex curves and diagonals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. Producing these curvilinear masks with traditional technologies required "fracturing" complex shapes into rectangles, which was challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.
3.  **Competition**: In the late 2000s and early 2010s, [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography and its Challenges | 193 nanometer immersion lithography]] emerged, significantly improving resolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>. This meant semiconductor manufacturers often didn't need to choose ILT over existing [[computational_lithography_advancements | OPC]] methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

Due to these challenges, ILT was considered "a bit too early for its time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. While some EDA vendors integrated ILT into their systems, its wide adoption was limited, primarily reserved for special situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. Luminescent Technologies was eventually split up in 2012, with parts acquired by KLA and Synopsys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.

## Changing Times and CuLitho

The landscape for ILT has changed. Mask writing tools have improved, with new multi-beam tools (e.g., from IMS) now making it possible to produce complex curvilinear masks in a reasonable timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.

The increasing complexity of modern leading-edge chips, such as Nvidia's Hopper with 80 billion transistors, demanding trillions of polygons, has forced fabs to use ILT more frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>. This necessity has incentivized efforts to make ILT work faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>.

[[computational_lithography_advancements | TSMC]] presented simulation results suggesting that [[computational_lithography_advancements | GPUs]] could significantly speed up ILT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>. Nvidia took on this challenge, leading to the development of [[computational_lithography_advancements | CuLitho]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>. Announced in March 2023, CuLitho is a software library for [[computational_lithography_advancements | computational lithography]] that Nvidia claims can deliver a performance leap of up to 40x beyond current lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. CuLitho is described as a collection of parallel algorithms invented by Nvidia scientists for accelerated primitive operations of OPC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. By integrating these GPU-accelerated algorithms into traditional OPC EDA software, it can process algorithms far faster than CPUs, resulting in an overall 23-42 times faster end-to-end computational lithography system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. This acceleration is crucial for the demanding computations of ILT.

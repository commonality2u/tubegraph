In the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Union successfully landed five probes on the surface of Venus, each surviving for over 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These [[venera_mission_successes_and_impacts | Venera missions]] represent a stunning [[engineering_breakthroughs_in_venera_landers | engineering achievement]] in space exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Hostile Environment of Venus

Venus, often called Earth's evil twin, is considered one of the hardest places to land in the Solar System, second only to the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. While similar in size to Earth, its atmosphere is vastly different due to a runaway greenhouse effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
The Venusian surface reaches temperatures of 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 Celsius), hotter than Mercury's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The surface pressure is equivalent to being over 0.5 miles (1 kilometer) underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This thick atmosphere presents significant [[challenges_of_landing_on_venus | challenges of landing on Venus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Additionally, its clouds are composed of sulfuric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, and atmospheric entry can heat a probe to 11,000 degrees Celsius due to friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Early Attempts and Learning (Venera 1-6)

By late 1967, the Soviets had experienced eleven failures in their attempts to reach Venus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The goal of the Venera project (Venera being Russian for Venus) was to land a probe on the Venusian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. With the space race in full swing, the Soviets aimed to surpass the Americans, who were sending a flyby probe, Mariner 5, to Venus around the same time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. After Venera 3 failed to reach the ground, the entire Venera mission was transferred to the aerospace company Lavochkin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Venera 4: First Atmospheric Data

Venera 4, an 11-foot (3.5-meter) tall probe, launched in autumn 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Its lander, a pressure shell with instruments and a parachute, successfully launched upon reaching Venus in October 1967 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. During atmospheric entry, temperatures hit 11,000 degrees Celsius and forces reached 450G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
The onboard instruments began sending back atmospheric data, initially recording 102 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius) and Earth-like pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. However, both measures quickly and unexpectedly rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. After 93 minutes, while still over 27 kilometers above the surface, Venera 4 was crushed, likely near its top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. At crush point, measurements showed 22 atmospheres and 530 degrees Fahrenheit (277 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
By this time, the American probe Mariner 5 had also reached Venus, sending back data on the planet's atmosphere and composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Comparing their data, the Soviets and Americans concluded Venus was far hotter, drier, and more hostile than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Venera 5 & 6: Incremental Improvements

Despite the new understanding of Venus's harsh conditions, Venera 5 and 6 were already finalized for their 1969 launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Engineers could only make minor strengthenings, leaving radical redesigns for later missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
Venera 5 transmitted data for 53 minutes before succumbing to pressures of 27 atmospheres and temperatures of 600 degrees Fahrenheit (320 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Venera 6 lasted 51 minutes, descending 37.8 kilometers into the atmosphere before also being crushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Achieving the Surface (Venera 7 & 8)

For the 1970 launch window, program directors were determined to reach the Venusian surface, armed with knowledge of the required resilience: 840 degrees Fahrenheit (450 degrees Celsius), 100 atmospheres, and corrosive acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
[[Engineering breakthroughs in Venera landers | Venera engineers]] consulted submarine designers for tips on surviving deep pressures and sourced new materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. The parachute was modified to make the lander fall faster, with a restricting cord melting at 390 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius) to fully deploy the chute for a soft landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The lander itself was an egg-shaped, smooth titanium structure with minimal ports, lined with shock absorbers and insulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The chamber was pre-chilled to freezing temperatures before entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Venera 7: The First (Unexpected) Landing

After a four-month journey, Venera 7 reached Venus in December 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. It descended for 35 minutes, transmitting data, but its parachute melted or tore six minutes into stage 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Venera 7 unexpectedly hit the ground at 35 miles (60 kilometers) per hour at 4:42 AM Venus solar time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The impact caused the probe to bounce, and the signal appeared to cut out a second after landing, leading Soviet engineers to believe it was crushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
However, months later, radio astronomers reviewing the data re-discovered a weak signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The bounce had misaligned the antenna, weakening the signal to 1-3% strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Venera 7 continued transmitting data for 23 minutes while on its side, in temperatures hot enough to melt zinc or lead, until its shell cracked and it too melted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This data, along with that from Venera 8 (launched in 1972), paved the way for new Venusian probes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## Photographic Panoramas (Venera 9 & 10)

It took until 1975 for the next series of [[venera_mission_successes_and_impacts | Venera missions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. By then, Soviet engineers understood what was needed, designing the probes to do more, including sending back black and white photographs â€“ their primary goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
New rockets developed for lunar and Martian propulsion allowed for significantly larger probes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Venera 9 and 10 were five times heavier than their predecessors, weighing 5 tons (5,000 kilograms) at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
Each mission included an orbiter and a lander component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. The entry capsule, covered in asbestos composite, would split like a plastic Easter egg to eject the lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The lander itself was a magnificently designed, hermetically sealed titanium sphere, 2.6 feet (80 centimeters) wide, holding instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. The inside was lined with polyurethane foam, wrapped in 5 inches (12 centimeters) of honeycomb composite insulation, and then another layer of titanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
A shock-absorbing ring was placed on the bottom, and a titanium disk resembling a hat on top served as an aerobrake, replacing the problematic two-stage parachute design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The parachute completely detached at 30 miles (50 kilometers) above the surface, with the aerobrake handling the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
Two cameras with goldfish bowl lenses were placed in the middle of the lander, protected by special quartz pressure windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Image data (512x128 pixels) was sent at one line every 3.5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Engineers estimated the probe would last about an hour on the surface, which was enough time to send the full panorama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### The First Images

In late October 1975, Venera 9 and 10 arrived and landed as planned, with their parachutes cutting at 50 kilometers and both landers hitting the ground at about 15 miles (25 kilometers) per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
Venera 9 landed first on a slight slope, possibly a hill or volcanic crater side, kicking up dust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. One of its two cameras successfully transmitted the first ever picture of the Venusian surface, revealing sharp rocks, soil, and a distant horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. The sun was shining brightly, though obscured by clouds, with a gentle breeze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
Venera 10 landed a few days later on a more featureless rolling plain with hardened pieces of magma, indicating older rocks chemically scorched by the acidic atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Both probes transmitted for 50-60 minutes until their orbiters went out of range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Internal temperatures were about 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) when transmissions ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. The orbiters later burned up in the atmosphere after completing their missions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
Venera 9 and 10 were stunning [[venera_mission_successes_and_impacts | successes]], representing a triumphant public relations event for the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Refinements and Final Landers (Venera 11-14)

Venera 11 and 12 conducted interesting science, but their trips are largely forgotten due to a mysterious electric anomaly that disabled their cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
Venera 13 and 14, launched in 1982, refined the principles of Venera 9 and 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Engineers improved cameras and scientific instruments, added new heat-resistant technologies, and guaranteed survival for at least 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. They also enabled color images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
Many sensors and instruments could now be mounted outside the spherical pressure chamber, made of platinum and covered in acid-resistant enamel, a testament to the engineers' understanding of the Venusian environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
Venera 13 landed as planned, its lens cap popping off to take a black and white contingency photo, followed by a color one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. The photos showed a surface of pebbled, loose soil amidst bedrock outcroppings, resembling an ocean floor, with rolling plateaus and an orange sky in the distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The Venusian atmosphere absorbs blue light, causing most things to appear orange or yellowish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
Venera 14's images showed a more weathered plain with fine-grained rock and less loose soil, similar to a baked cake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Famously, its drill landed exactly where the lens cap had fallen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
Both probes carried microphones, recording sounds from Venus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. The audio revealed the lens cap blowing off and the drill operating, followed by sounds of a gently blowing wind with faint hints of distant rumblings, presumed to be Venus-quakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

## Legacy and Future Exploration

The successful Venera 13 and 14 missions marked the last landers to touch the Venusian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Venera 15 and 16, built in the 1980s, swapped the lander component for radar, mapping Venusian topography from orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
Since then, space programs have largely shifted focus to the Moon and [[soviet_mars_missions_from_1960_to_1973 | Mars]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. No human is expected to set foot on Venus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. While it is possible to send another lander, the primary issue is economics and cost-benefit, given that probes survive for less than a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. Most [[future_possibilities_for_venus_exploration | Venus exploration]] proposals now involve balloons and high-altitude floating explorations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. To make a lander economically viable, it would need to move around and last for weeks, requiring cooling technologies that are "a few years away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
Much of the secret work from the Soviet era for the Venera series is now lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.
Regardless, the Venera series was an amazing [[engineering_breakthroughs_in_venera_landers | engineering achievement]] and, in the view of some, represented the pinnacle of the country's [[soviet_space_exploration_achievements_and_failures | Soviet space exploration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

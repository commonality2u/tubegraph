International Computers Limited (ICL) was a British computer manufacturer formed in 1968 through a government-arranged "shotgun marriage" of three computer manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Envisioned as the United Kingdom's answer to IBM, a national champion in computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, ICL's history is deeply intertwined with a series of mergers and acquisitions that ultimately shaped its trajectory and eventual demise.

## Pre-ICL Mergers: The Formation of ICT

Before ICL, the British computing landscape saw several significant consolidations. One key player was the British Tabulating Machine Company (BTM), founded in 1907 with an exclusive license to Hermann Hollerith's punch card technology across the British Empire (excluding Canada) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This license required BTM to pay 25% of its revenue to Hollerith's company, which became IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. In 1949, IBM and BTM mutually dissolved this decades-long agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. While BTM lost access to IBM's superior products and R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>, the termination of the 25% royalty tripled their operating profit, which they could then invest in product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

By 1958, BTM's major competitor, Power Samas, was in decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>. BTM seized the opportunity to consolidate the industry, merging with Power Samas in 1959 to create International Computers and Tabulators Limited (ICT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.

However, this initial merger proved to be a significant challenge:
*   **Management Headache**: Acquiring Power Samas created a "massive headache" for BTM's management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>.
*   **Lost Progress**: Digesting Power Samas's mechanically-minded R&D department resulted in years of lost progress for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. These lost years could have been spent upgrading their tabulating machines to electronic computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>.

## Further Consolidation and the Birth of ICL

The 1960s saw a wave of consolidation in the British computing industry as companies struggled to compete with American giants like IBM. ICT and English Electric emerged as the two main players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>.

ICT expanded its operations through several acquisitions:
*   In 1961, ICT acquired the computer interests of GEC Computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[18:23:00]</a>.
*   In 1962, it acquired the computer interests of Electrical and Musical Industries (EMI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>.
*   In 1963, ICT acquired the computer interests of Ferranti, which provided a key product for its future: the Canadian-made Ferranti Packard 6000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>.

English Electric, for its part, acquired the computer interests of Leo Computers in 1963 and Marconi in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>.

While these consolidations reduced the number of players, they created significant internal challenges:
*   **Indigestion**: This wave of mergers left both ICT and English Electric with a form of "indigestion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>.
*   **Massive Mess**: The haphazard nature of these mergers, especially in the computer industry, resulted in a "massive mess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:27:00">[19:27:00]</a>.
*   **Incompatible Systems**: Each merged company had different engineering approaches, techniques, and systems administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>. ICT, for example, was making too many computer products, most of which were not good, and none of their software or hardware was compatible with each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. This incompatibility resulted in a "large technology gap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>.

The British government, specifically the Ministry of Technology (Mintech), became increasingly concerned about the widening technology gap with America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>. To counter this, Mintech sought to further consolidate the industry and make it competitive against IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:44:00">[23:44:00]</a>. This meant merging English Electric and ICT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:50:00">[23:50:00]</a>.

After initial resistance, the two companies agreed to a merger in 1967, bolstered by a dowry of up to 30 million pounds from the government (though it was later reduced to 13.5 million due to the UK economy's worsening) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:11:00">[24:11:00]</a>. The merger finalized in July 1968, creating **ICL** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>.

At its formation, ICL generated 100 million pounds in annual revenue, employed 34,000 people, and was the world's largest non-American computer manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[24:58:00]</a>. However, it immediately inherited two incompatible mainframe product families from its predecessors: the 1900 series from ICT and the System 4 from English Electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>. Political pressure from the Labour government prevented ICL from phasing out the outdated 1900 series, as the System 4 was not a "British made thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:31:00">[25:31:00]</a>. This political interference kept ICL focused on mainframes, causing it to miss the lucrative minicomputer boom of the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:00">[25:57:00]</a>.

## Later Acquisitions and Final Demise

ICL continued to adapt through acquisitions, notably entering the small business space with its 1976 acquisition of Singer Business Machines and its successful System 10 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>. This contributed to the company's profitability at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>.

However, the immense R&D costs of competing in the mainframe market, especially against IBM and Fujitsu, pushed ICL to seek partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:49:00">[29:49:00]</a>. In 1981, ICL struck a technology transfer deal with Fujitsu, gaining access to Fujitsu's advanced semiconductor technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16:00">[31:16:00]</a>.

Despite this, ICL's status as a national champion was drawing to a close. In 1984, ICL was taken over by the British telecommunications firm Standard Telephone and Cables (STC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:49:00">[31:49:00]</a>. This acquisition effectively ended the company's hopes of being a national champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:09:00">[32:09:00]</a>. Under STC, ICL slashed its R&D spending, closed manufacturing plants, and focused on sales and systems integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:13:00">[32:13:00]</a>. It evolved into a "simple assembler and distributor," sourcing cheapest components and selling them to existing clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:27:00">[32:27:00]</a>.

Finally, in 1990, Fujitsu acquired ICL, a move that was a "minor shock to the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:58:00">[32:58:00]</a>. Fujitsu eventually shut down the ICL brand for good after 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:07:00">[33:07:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[history_of_international_computers_limited_icl | history of International Computers Limited ICL]] demonstrates how mergers and acquisitions played a central role in its rise and fall:
*   **Initial Growth and Consolidation**: Early mergers, particularly the formation of ICT, aimed to consolidate British computing power but often led to internal organizational and technological challenges due to disparate systems.
*   **Government Intervention**: The "shotgun marriage" forming ICL was a political act to create a national champion, but it burdened the company with incompatible product lines and political pressures that hindered strategic focus.
*   **Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions**: Later, ICL sought partners for technological capabilities (Fujitsu) and acquired companies for market expansion (Singer).
*   **Loss of Independence**: The acquisitions by STC and then Fujitsu marked the end of ICL as an independent British computing force, transforming it from a developer and manufacturer into an assembler and distributor.

Ultimately, while mergers were intended to strengthen ICL and help it compete with IBM, the haphazard nature of some integrations, combined with political interference and the sheer scale of investment required to keep pace with industry leaders, meant ICL could never achieve the technical or business leadership it sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:10:00">[33:10:00]</a>. The pursuit of national prestige through these consolidations led ICL to invest heavily in the mainframe market, causing it to miss out on emerging trends and contributing to its eventual marginalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a>.

India's journey to becoming a nuclear power, spearheaded by the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC), was fraught with various criticisms and challenges, both internal and external, despite its eventual success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Early Challenges and Isolation

Initially, [[Dr Homi Bhabha and the Foundation of Indias Atomic Program | Dr. Homi Bhabha]], widely regarded as the architect of India's atomic program, viewed his stay in India as a temporary disruption to his career, expressing a desire to return to the United Kingdom or the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. India, amidst its fight for independence, was not seen as a place for leading-edge science, leading to Bhabha feeling intellectually isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

A significant early challenge involved securing access to strategic nuclear ores. India possessed abundant thorium, which could be converted into fissile uranium-233, but had limited uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. The Travancore principality, though indirectly ruled by the United Kingdom, controlled vital monazite (a source of thorium) deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. The Indian government had to exert considerable pressure, with [[Indias Early Nuclear Policy and Nehrus Leadership | Jawaharlal Nehru]] even considering military action, to ensure Travancore joined the union and its nuclear ores came under Indian control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

Early international collaborations also yielded limited benefits. For instance, a 1948 agreement with France for a monazite processing plant and joint research on beryllium-moderated reactors, while the first bilateral international nuclear project after World War II, provided "quite small" actual benefits to India's atomic program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

Relations with the United States were often strained due to America's discomfort with India's non-alignment policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. This tension was highlighted in 1953 when the US Embassy discovered an Indian state-owned enterprise was shipping thorium nitrate to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. This triggered a major problem due to America's Mutual Defense Act, which mandated terminating aid to countries trading embargoed items with Communist nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. [[Indias Early Nuclear Policy and Nehrus Leadership | Nehru]] resisted US dictates on trade, requiring substantial behind-the-scenes negotiation for the US to buy the thorium at an inflated price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. Furthermore, Pakistan's growing partnership with the US deepened India's antipathy towards America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

## Internal Scrutiny and Financial Concerns

The AEC, despite receiving substantial protection and reporting directly to the Prime Minister, faced significant criticism domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. The astrophysicist Meghnad Saha, who later became a Member of Parliament, was a particularly vocal critic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. He disliked the AEC's approach to atomic development, specifically targeting its:
*   **Lack of results:** Saha noted that a promised nuclear reactor had not been set up years after the initial announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of transparency:** He criticized the AEC's secretive operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.
*   **Close ties to private enterprises:** Saha, a Communist aligned with the Soviet Union, was critical of the AEC's connections to groups like the Tata Group, given that Bhabha's uncle by marriage was Sir Dorabji Tata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.
*   **Perceived elitism:** Saha disputed the notion that atomic scientists were a "special class by themselves," arguing they were "ordinary chemists, ordinary physicists, biologists and others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. He believed India was wasting its human resource advantage by pretending otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.

Many Indians shared the concern that the pursuit of atomic energy would be an "expensive boondoggle" when funds were desperately needed for other priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. The AEC's early focus on theory had led to a neglect of industrial capability, making a real reactor "far beyond their domestic capability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. This public scrutiny ultimately pushed the AEC to demonstrate concrete results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

## Geopolitical Pressures and Policy Hesitancy

Before Eisenhower's "Atoms for Peace" speech in December 1953, a "global silence on nuclear technology" prevailed, making it difficult for countries like India to acquire know-how <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. While "Atoms for Peace" opened doors, it also "downplayed" the dangers of non-proliferation, allowing countries to switch between peaceful and military applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.

Despite the technical capability to produce a nuclear weapon by 1965, India's actual detonation was delayed by many years due to significant political hesitancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>. [[Indias Early Nuclear Policy and Nehrus Leadership | Nehru]] and other influential groups were against pursuing the weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a>.

The humiliating [[Impact of geopolitical tensions on Chinas nuclear program | Sino-Indian War of 1962]], which exposed India's weak defenses, intensified calls from the right-wing Jana Sangh Party for India to build the Bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:00">[23:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>. However, [[Indias Early Nuclear Policy and Nehrus Leadership | Nehru]] steadfastly maintained India's policy against nuclear weapons, arguing it would contradict India's call for nuclear powers to cease testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:57:00">[23:57:00]</a>. He believed atomic bombs would not aid India's growth, though he acknowledged they might someday be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>.

The first Chinese nuclear weapons test in October 1964 further impacted Indian politics, causing the ruling Congress Party to split on how to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:00">[25:27:00]</a>. Public debate ensued, with many elites citing the "huge costs" of a nuclear weapons program amidst rising inflation and food shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:19:00">[27:19:00]</a>. [[Dr Homi Bhabha and the Foundation of Indias Atomic Program | Bhabha]] attempted to counter this by understating the cost of nuclear bombs in a UN speech, claiming 50 atomic bombs would cost only $21 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:41:00">[27:41:00]</a>, but this figure excluded infrastructure costs and delivery systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>. Some also argued that China's nuclear weapons were not relevant to India, citing China's restraint in the 1962 war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:14:00">[28:14:00]</a>.

For Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, the critical issue was solving the "ongoing food shortage crisis," which he prioritized over the bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:00">[28:49:00]</a>.

## Leadership Transitions and Internal Divergence

The [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965]] brought the threat from Pakistan back to the forefront and prompted Chinese nuclear threats against India, which were ultimately parried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[29:27:00]</a>. The US halting military exports to both India and Pakistan during this war also "obliterated trust that the West would grant a nuclear umbrella" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:02:00">[30:02:00]</a>. This further fueled domestic calls for India to build its own bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:13:00">[30:13:00]</a>.

A period of political turmoil followed, with Shastri's sudden death in January 1966 and [[Dr Homi Bhabha and the Foundation of Indias Atomic Program | Bhabha's]] tragic plane crash on the same day [[Indira Gandhi]] was sworn in as Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:27:00">[30:27:00]</a>. These deaths left a "massive void" in India's nuclear policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a>.

Vikram Sarabhai, appointed to take over many of [[Dr Homi Bhabha and the Foundation of Indias Atomic Program | Bhabha's]] posts, including Secretary of the Department of Atomic Energy, fundamentally opposed nuclear weapons, doubting their practical benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:17:00">[31:17:00]</a>. He advocated instead for a large nuclear reactor expansion program for public benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:26:00">[32:26:00]</a>. However, Homi Sethna, the new AEC chairperson who had led the Project Phoenix plutonium reprocessing plant, saw no issue with a peaceful nuclear detonation and initiated work on an implosion-type plutonium bomb design in 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:50:00">[31:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:07:00">[32:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:39:00">[32:39:00]</a>. Sarabhai, despite being Sethna's nominal boss, did not stop the effort, perhaps due to his aversion to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:48:00">[32:48:00]</a>. His death in December 1971 removed "the last large political obstacle" to a nuclear explosion test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:00">[32:54:00]</a>.

Technical challenges also arose, such as the Indian Army initially refusing to dig the unusual L-shaped shaft for the "seismic experiment" in the Thar desert until ordered by [[Indira Gandhi]] herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:00">[34:03:00]</a>. An accidental aquifer hit in January 1974 further delayed the test by a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:34:00">[34:34:00]</a>.

## Post-Detonation Backlash

The 1974 Indian nuclear explosion, while a source of national pride domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:39:00">[38:39:00]</a>, triggered "immense international backlash," particularly from countries like Canada, which surprised both Indian scientists and the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:12:00">[39:12:00]</a>. This reaction, partly driven by India being the first country to use civilian nuclear energy technology to make a bomb, led to new efforts in controlling nuclear technology to prevent similar future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:57:00">[38:57:00]</a>. The backlash was severe enough that India did not conduct a second peaceful nuclear explosion for two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:19:00">[39:19:00]</a>.

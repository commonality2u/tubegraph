In late February 2022, [[impact_of_tsmc_sanctions_on_russia | Taiwan's Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)]] announced it would halt shipments to Russia due to a new round of sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This halt affected shipments from Russian "fabulous" companies like Baikal, MCST, Yadro, and STC Module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Intel and AMD also stopped their shipments to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

While Russia has aimed to create its own semiconductor supply in recent years, domestic capacity to manufacture these designs has fallen further and further behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This has led to [[russias_domestic_semiconductor_industry_challenges | Russia's ever-worsening domestic semiconductor manufacturing industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Historical Context
The Soviet Union consistently suffered from a significant technology gap in computers and advanced electronics with the United States, dating back to the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. By the time of its collapse in 1991, the country faced a painful shortage of sufficiently powerful integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The combined computing power of all computers in the Soviet Union was two generations behind a single American Cray supercomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

The collapse fragmented the Soviet scientific industrial complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Russia was left with 96% of vacuum electronics production facilities, while the most advanced semiconductor production facilities were located in East Germany, Belarus, and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Russian industrial policy post-collapse exacerbated the issue by pivoting away from domestic electronics, increasing the country's reliance on imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

Today, Russia remains a consumer and net importer of integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. In 2020, most of these imports came from Malaysia, China, Vietnam, and other Asian countries, including Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Following threatened sanctions in 2014 after events in Crimea, the Russian government committed to developing homegrown chips through an import substitution scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Key Russian Semiconductor Manufacturers

### Micron Group
Micron Group is Russia's largest domestic semiconductor manufacturing company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:19">[02:58:19]</a>.
*   **Structure**: It operates as an Integrated Design Manufacturer (IDM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:97">[03:02:97]</a>.
*   **Output**: Micron accounts for 54% of Russia's exported technology hardware products, producing about 500 million chips annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:19">[03:04:19]</a>.
*   **History**: Founded in 1964 as the Research Institute for Molecular Electronics, its plant was the first in Russia to successfully produce an integrated circuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:35">[03:12:35]</a>. During the 1970s and 80s, it produced microprocessors for applications like air defense and Venus space programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:21">[03:25:21]</a>. Micron, along with Angstrom and Integral (Belarus), constituted the "big three" IC manufacturers of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Products**: Today, Micron fabs RFID tickets, SIM cards, and other smart card products, specializing in RFID technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. It produces around 30 million banking cards, biometric passports, and transport cards annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:77">[03:53:77]</a>. The company produced bank chips for Russia's domestic payment system, Mir, and travel tickets for Moscow's transport network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Operations**: Micron employs approximately 1,500 people and serves over 400 customers in Russia (including top cell carriers, transport companies, banks, and government agencies) and 100 customers overseas via sales offices in Japan, China, and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
*   **Financials**: In 2019, the company generated roughly $195 million USD in revenue, which increased to $260 million USD in 2020, bolstered by large subsidies from Moscow government organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Micron reported a net loss in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.
*   **Capabilities**: Its Zelenograd fab produces 100mm, 150mm, and 200mm wafers, with the 200mm line being the most sophisticated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.
    *   **180nm and 90nm**: In 2007, Micron signed a technology transfer deal with STMicroelectronics to acquire IP for their 180nm process node, which expanded to 90nm in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. The 90nm production line launched in 2012, costing 16.5 billion rubles (approx. $590 million USD at 2017 rates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. This project was co-financed by Russnano, a government fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. At the time of launch, Russia was about nine years behind the leading edge, as the 90nm node first reached commercial production in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.
    *   **65nm**: Micron aimed to develop the 65nm node independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. In 2014, concurrent with the Elbrus 2SM announcement, Micron claimed successful achievement of the 65nm node at a volume of 500 200mm wafers per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. This was hailed as "proof of Russian technology independence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. However, this announcement appears to have been premature, as the process was more a "working science experiment" than a commercial offering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. Without imported lithography scanners, a 65nm line is not commercially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. Micron's website states its 65nm production line is "under development, production qualification and implementation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. This means Russia's gap with the leading edge has grown from 9 years to over 15 years, as commercial 65nm nodes shipped in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>.
*   **Management & Future Plans**: In 2016, Micron's management team was replaced by Gulnara Kazya Nova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. The new team announced plans to invest in factory expansion, produce more chip types, and even LEDs, aiming for 30 billion rubles in revenue by 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. This included a 28nm capable factory by 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>, but the company missed its 2020 revenue target by 15 billion rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

### Citronix
Citronix is a sister company to Micron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.
*   **Ambitious Plans**: Around 2007, Citronix applied for a subsidy to develop a chip manufacturing fab for 65nm and 45nm process nodes on 300mm wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. The proposed project, jointly financed with the Russian government, was estimated to cost about $2.3 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. Chip production was scheduled to begin in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   **Challenges**: The sheer capital intensity of the project, combined with a lack of technology partners, appears to have caused Citronix to pull back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. Their website currently lists servers, IT software, and smartwatches, but no chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

### Angstrom
Angstrom is another leading Russian microelectronics fab, headquartered in Zelenograd alongside Micron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.
*   **History**: Dating back to 1963 as the Research Institute of Precision Technology, Angstrom developed and produced the Electronics NTS-8010, the Soviet Union's first completely domestic computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.
*   **Capabilities**: Currently, the foundry offers 130nm and 90nm process nodes on 200mm wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. Their capacity is about 180,000 wafers per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>, which is a far cry from a TSMC gigafab that produces an equivalent number in a single month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.
*   **Financial Issues**: This lack of scale likely contributed to Angstrom filing for bankruptcy sometime in 2018 or 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. In 2008, the company borrowed nearly a billion dollars from state development bank VEB to purchase old 110nm and 130nm chip-making equipment from AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. The plan was to produce 90nm smart card microchips by 2010 and upgrade to 65nm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. However, chips only started rolling off the line in 2016, and their 65nm process is not yet available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.
*   **Sanctions and Acquisition**: Shortly after, Angstrom was hit by U.S. sanctions, probably due to its involvement in the Russian military and nuclear industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. This prevented an export business and, combined with debt, led to insolvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. In 2021, VEB founded a subsidiary called NM Tech, which purchased Angstrom's assets for 8.4 billion rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. NM Tech announced a 10-year plan to become a pure-play foundry and achieve 10nm production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.

## Domestic Design Ventures (Fabbed Abroad)
Due to the lagging capabilities of the domestic industry, more sophisticated Russian semiconductor design ventures have historically needed to rely on overseas fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

### Elbrus Microprocessors (Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies - MCST)
*   The Elbrus 2SM was declared the first completely Russian microprocessor and its creation in 2014 was seen as the year's top technology achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.
*   This 90nm processor was likely more for public relations than practical use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. The original Elbrus 2SM, made using a TSMC 90nm node, seemed to perform better than the Micron version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.
*   The latest iteration is the Elbrus 8CB chip, fabbed on a 28nm process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.

### Baikal CPUs (Baikal Electronics)
*   Baikal Electronics employs modern practices and EDA tools like Synopsys to develop ARM-based chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>.
*   Their latest offering is the Baikal-M series, an eight-core System-on-Chip (SoC) fabbed on a TSMC 28nm process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. A RISC-V version is also being explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.
*   **Sales & Challenges**: Sales were reportedly strong, with plans in November 2020 to order over 200,000 pieces from TSMC in Q1 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. However, the company faced issues securing enough fab capacity due to the automaker chip shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.
*   **Acquisition & Future**: In June 2021, Baikal was acquired by the Vartan Group, an electronics conglomerate that also makes Russia's domestic OS, AstroLinux <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>. AstroLinux is frequently used within the Russian government, including its military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>. Baikal then announced a plan to invest 23 billion rubles to expand into the server space, develop a 6nm chip, and sell over half a million Baikal chips, mostly to government organizations looking to meet Russian import substitution policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>.

## Overall Assessment
Considering the circumstances, it is doubtful that [[russias_domestic_semiconductor_industry_challenges | the Russian semiconductor manufacturing industry]] will advance past 65 nanometers in the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>.

### Potential Alternatives
Russia may look to [[potential_russian_alternatives_for_semiconductor_sourcing | alternative sources]] for its semiconductor needs.
*   **Belarus (Integral)**: A significant portion of Soviet integrated circuit production was located in Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>. Integral was the third of the "big three" Soviet semiconductor manufacturers, launched in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>. Integral's most sophisticated node, as of a 2017 sales document, is a 350nm process, which first hit the market in 1993 (used for the Nintendo 64) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. This is not a viable alternative to a TSMC 28nm node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>.
*   **China (SMIC)**: Shanghai-based SMIC's most advanced node is a 14nm process, rumored to have good yields, though it's not a large part of their business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>. SMIC had a strong 2021 and is investing $9 billion in a new fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>. Given the warm relations between Russia and China, SMIC might seem like a logical choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>. However, SMIC heavily relies on chip-making equipment imports from the Netherlands and Japan, which could present challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>.

## Broader Impact
In the short and medium term, the halt of semiconductor shipments may not have a drastic immediate effect, as Russia has large stockpiles and contingency plans in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. Furthermore, some military equipment does not require leading-edge chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.

However, these sanctions will push what remains of Russia's industries even further behind its competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>. Russia's largest industries chronically lag behind Western peers in digitization and modernization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>. For example:
*   Russia has 23 times fewer industrial robots per 10,000 employees than the world average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>.
*   Its share of computer numerical control (CNC) machines in industry is only 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>.
*   Only 1% of the data generated by its installed sensors is utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.

These sanctions make it significantly harder for Russian businesses and their employees to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>. The inability of the Soviet Communist Party to close the widening technology gap with the West contributed to a broad loss of confidence in its competency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>, and this historical parallel suggests a potential long-term risk for Russia today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>.

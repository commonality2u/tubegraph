From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 
In late December 2024, Nissan announced a plan to [[nissan_and_honda_merger | merge with Honda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While called a merger, it is more akin to a takeover, hastily arranged by the [[government_policies_and_the_automotive_industry | Japanese government]] to save a struggling company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Nissan's history has been volatile, but this latest downturn appears to be a critical moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Beginnings
In 1999, Carlos Ghosn was Renault's second-highest executive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. He joined Renault in 1996 from the tire company Michelin during a period of significant turmoil, when Renault experienced a $926 million fiscal loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Through aggressive cost-cutting and new car introductions, the [[government_policies_and_the_automotive_industry | state-owned company]] achieved a $1 billion profit by 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Ghosn, known as "Le Cost Killer," was then appointed COO of Nissan to facilitate a turnaround <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

In May 1999, Renault invested 5 billion euros into Nissan, acquiring 36.8% of its shares with an option for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Years of excessive global expansion, foreign assimilation, and lax management had left Nissan with inefficient factories (operating at only 53% utilization), a poor product lineup (only 4 out of 40+ lines were profitable), and unproductive workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This move was met with skepticism, with some analysts believing Nissan was beyond saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Le Cost Killer
Over the next two years, Ghosn and his team of 40 French executives implemented stringent cost-cutting measures and debt reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. These changes often defied traditional Nissan business practices but were seen as necessary due to the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Key actions included:
*   **Simplifying Portfolio**: The Renault team streamlined Nissan's complex portfolio of cross-stock holdings, as Nissan held stocks in 1,300 companies simply because they were part of the *Keiretsu* business family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Halving Suppliers**: The company's extensive supplier network was cut in half, as many suppliers had charged inflated prices due to their "family" ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Relationship managers were assigned to secure the best prices regardless of prior connections, yielding at least $2.25 billion in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Shaking Up Incentives**: Ghosn altered the employee incentive structure by promoting younger talent based on merit rather than seniority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Job Cuts and Factory Closures**: Controversially from a Japanese cultural standpoint, Ghosn's revival plan included cutting 21,000 jobs through attrition and closing five factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. These cuts were argued as essential to remove inefficiencies, such as "ghost jobs" held by former senior managers who hindered progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

To mitigate cultural resistance, Ghosn also brought back classic Nissan cars like the Z-series and GT-R <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. The financial results were undeniable: Nissan returned to profitability in 2002, ahead of schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Continuing On
Ghosn's success garnered him significant fame beyond the business world, earning him the title of Industry Leader of the Year by *Automotive News* for three consecutive years, and even inspiring a Japanese manga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. During the 2000s, when Ford and General Motors faced crises and received emergency government loans, figures like Steve Rattner, the US "Car Czar," attempted to recruit Ghosn to lead General Motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. However, Ghosn declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

In 2002, Renault increased its stake in Nissan to 43%, and Nissan acquired a 15% stake in Renault (without equivalent voting capacity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. By 2005, Ghosn became CEO of Renault while retaining his position at Nissan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Nissan's performance improved, meeting its 2002 goals by selling a million more cars annually and maintaining strong operating margins of 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, boosted by a strong US market for SUVs and passenger cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Ghosn declared Nissan's recovery complete but immediately announced another three-year plan, "value up," to add another million annual sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### China
A core part of Ghosn's growth strategy was to capitalize on the burgeoning [[impact_of_the_chinese_ev_market_on_nissan | Chinese automotive market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. In 2000, Nissan established a joint venture (JV) called Fengshen Auto (風神, or "wind god") with state-owned Dongfeng Motor and two other car companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Fengshen served as a local assembly operation, producing Chinese versions of Nissan's Bluebird car, which generated 2 billion RMB in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

This success led the [[government_policies_and_the_automotive_industry | Chinese government]] to seek a deeper partnership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. In 2001, Ghosn traveled to Mainland China, and by September 2002, he negotiated a 50-50 partnership for producing passenger cars and trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The new JV initially faced challenges due to cultural differences and misalignment of responsibilities, with Chinese workers in charge of production and Japanese workers in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. A 10% sales decrease in 2004 led to a restructuring that corrected these issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. In 2005, Dongfeng Nissan's sales surged by 160%, making it the fastest-growing carmaker in China that year, and it remained a top-10 carmaker for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Looming Clouds
Throughout the 2000s, Nissan, under Ghosn's leadership, encountered [[challenges_facing_nissan_in_the_automotive_industry | major short and long term challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Short-term challenges included the Global Financial Crisis, which saw sales drop 22% and resulted in a $2.9 billion net loss in 2009, necessitating thousands of job cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The devastating March 2011 earthquake further disrupted factories and global supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

Ghosn correctly identified long-term industry-wide developments that would transform the automotive sector, referencing Sergio Marchionne's 2015 presentation "Confessions of a Capital Junkie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Marchionne highlighted rising R&D costs to meet increasingly stringent safety and environmental regulations, leading to higher fixed costs of car development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This meant carmakers needed to sell significantly more vehicles to achieve a good return, and the high proportion of fixed costs led to volatile profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Consolidation was identified as a way to share these costs and survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

Ghosn accurately predicted these trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. He believed the Renault-Nissan alliance, with six million annual units sold, could compete with giants like VW, Toyota, or GM, aiming for approximately 10 million cars per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. In 2011, he announced a plan to increase global market share from 5.8% to 8% and raise operating margins, partly by expanding sales in Japan, China, and the United States, targeting 10% share by 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

### Unhealthy Growth
These ambitious targets were pursued through methods that were arguably detrimental to Nissan's long-term health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>:
*   **Deep Discounts**: Nissan began offering significant and prolonged discounts on its cars. By 2018, incentives averaged 16.7%, higher than the industry average of 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Dealer Incentives**: The company structured dealer incentives to favor aggressive sales, using a "stair step" bonus system where dealers received large cash bonuses for hitting ambitious quotas but nothing if they fell short, leading to disgruntled dealers and departures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Fleet Sales**: A long-term strategy involved increasing sales to rental car fleets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. While boosting immediate sales, this practice could flood the used car market with high-mileage vehicles, disrupting resale values for other customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

These actions prioritized "growth at all costs," damaging brand value, alienating dealers, and concerning consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

### Missed Opportunities
Under Ghosn's leadership, Nissan's product lineup also began to stagnate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. As American consumer tastes shifted towards SUVs and trucks in the late 2000s and early 2010s due to cheaper gas, Nissan's core sedan lines lost favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. While some high-potential products were introduced, they ultimately failed to gain traction:
*   **Nissan Titan Pickup Truck**: Introduced in 2003 to challenge Ford and GM, the Titan proved difficult to manufacture, its design became outdated, and sales consistently fell short of Ghosn's public target of 100,000 units annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Nissan Leaf EV**: The Leaf was an electric vehicle pioneer, and Ghosn promoted it extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. He also envisioned Nissan cars having self-driving capabilities by 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. While EVs and self-driving became winning ideas, Nissan's execution was lacking, leading to missed opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. For example, the Nissan Leaf and Renault ZOE, developed simultaneously, shared almost no common parts, including batteries, which led to high costs and lost momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

### Simmering Tensions
Ghosn correctly identified the need for consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. While purchasing was the only area of collaboration in 2005, he pushed for closer ties, especially in manufacturing, as exemplified by a joint plant in India built in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Following the 2011 announcement, Ghosn intensified efforts, cutting individual budgets to force collaboration and appointing managers with responsibilities in both companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. He aimed for 70% of the Alliance's cars to be made from one of three common platforms (compacts, minivans, midsized vehicles) by 2020, known as the Renault-Nissan Common Module Family, which facilitated successful models like the Nissan Rogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

However, these attempts ran into [[cultural_and_geopolitical_tensions_within_the_renaultnissan_alliance | simmering cultural and geopolitical tensions inside the Alliance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Car engineers resisted such standardization, feeling it eroded the cars' unique identities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Nissan also perceived the arrangement as unfair, with the smaller Renault having voting power over Nissan but not vice versa, and Nissan increasingly propping up Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Renault, however, viewed the shareholding arrangement as a contractual matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. These tensions had [[cultural_and_geopolitical_tensions_within_the_renaultnissan_alliance | geopolitical concerns]] due to both companies' close ties with their respective governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. A notable "kerfuffle" occurred in 2015 when the [[government_policies_and_the_automotive_industry | French government]] raised its stake in Renault, threatening Nissan, leading to an agreement that France would not interfere in Nissan's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

### Ghosn the Celebrity
Problems also arose concerning Ghosn himself. After nearly two decades leading Nissan, he had solidified his control with a handpicked board and no clear successors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. Particularly after becoming CEO of Renault in 2005, Ghosn developed a taste for a lavish, jet-setting lifestyle, including art collecting, winery investments, and mingling with elites at Davos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

His compensation became a point of contention within the Japanese context. In 2010, he reportedly earned $9.6 million in cash and stock, significantly higher than Nissan's next highest-paid executive ($2.2 million) and even [[masaru_ibuka_and_akio_moritas_leadership | Akio Toyoda]], Toyota's chairman, who made $1.4 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. This high pay, coupled with a lifestyle that included renting Versailles for his wedding, fueled criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

### Arrest and Escape
Ghosn's pay disputes, extended tenure, lifestyle, and alliance tensions ultimately led to his downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>. The proximate cause was an internal audit discovery that Nissan had purchased residences in Lebanon and Brazil for Ghosn's personal use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Unusually, the audit team bypassed Nissan's board and went directly to law enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

In November 2018, Carlos Ghosn was lured to Japan under the guise of a high-level meeting, arrested, stripped of his positions, and charged with underreporting his income by 5 billion yen over five years, with additional charges later added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Ghosn maintained his innocence and was eventually released on bail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. A year later, he famously escaped Japan to Lebanon, reportedly hidden inside a musical equipment box, claiming he was fleeing a rigged justice system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. The two Americans who assisted his escape were later arrested in the US, extradited to Japan, and jailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. The SEC alleged that Ghosn and his Nissan team concealed up to $140 million in compensation; all parties settled and paid nominal fines in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

## Post-Ghosn
Ghosn's abrupt departure left a void as he was a critical connector within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. His immediate successor as Nissan CEO, Hiroto Saikawa, also had to resign due to stock pay violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

From 2019 to 2021, [[challenges_facing_nissan_in_the_automotive_industry | Nissan struggled to regain itself]] after the excesses of the Ghosn era and amidst a pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. They cut more jobs, closed factories, reduced incentives and fleet sales, and reset dealer relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. This led to significant revenue loss, though it has since recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

A major priority was to reset the unequal shareholding relationship with Renault, a complex process marked by [[cultural_and_geopolitical_tensions_within_the_renaultnissan_alliance | toxicity, leaks to the press, massive internal infighting, and tangled ties to disentangle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. The final deal was sealed in 2023, with Nissan forcing out its COO and two directors who objected to the agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. This deal trimmed Renault's stake in Nissan to 15% (by selling some shares and putting others in a trust), and Nissan gained voting rights for its 15% stake in Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. In return, Nissan agreed to invest in Renault's new EV division, Ampere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. Additionally, Mitsubishi Motors, which had been acquired in 2016 after an emissions scandal, remained an uncertain third partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

Nissan's CEO Makoto Uchida acknowledged the past challenges of the alliance but emphasized the need to focus on the future, citing China and the US EV market as major challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

### Rise of the EVs
The rapid and aggressive emergence of [[impact_of_the_chinese_ev_market_on_nissan | Chinese EV companies]] has profoundly impacted Nissan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. These companies develop, manufacture, and sell cars like consumer electronics, fueled by a powerful EV ecosystem and a massive domestic market that enables economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. The [[impact_of_the_chinese_ev_market_on_nissan | Chinese EV industry spits fire like none other]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

The old guard Chinese internal combustion engine joint ventures, such as Dongfeng Nissan, struggled to keep pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. In 2023, [[impact_of_the_chinese_ev_market_on_nissan | Nissan's Chinese sales fell some 30%]], with similar declines projected for 2024, and factory utilization at only 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. China accounts for a third of Nissan's sales, making it their top market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. This challenge was exacerbated by management chaos surrounding the share deal with Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. The ongoing management turmoil is expected to continue with [[nissan_and_honda_merger | merger talks with Honda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

## Conclusion
The recent Honda-Nissan talks were reportedly initiated after Foxconn, the Taiwanese giant, began exploring opportunities to buy into Nissan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Foxconn has been aiming to enter the EV industry to help clients penetrate global markets, attempting to partner with companies like Lordstown and Fisker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. While Foxconn has demonstrated its capability to make good EVs, running companies like Sharp has not been without issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.

The abrupt tie-up with Honda was a move to protect Nissan, one of Japan Inc's "crown jewels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. However, Honda is reportedly reluctant to deal with Nissan's problems, including an aging product lineup and a disproportionate workforce in Japan compared to its production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. Honda's CEO famously stated, when asked why Nissan would be a good partner, "That's a difficult one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. Honda has set a target for Nissan to triple its profit by 2026 as a condition for the merger, which raises questions about the necessity of the merger if Nissan can achieve such a feat independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. The situation is described as a "raging dumpster fire," and regardless of whether the merger occurs, the end of Nissan as an independent entity appears to be approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>.

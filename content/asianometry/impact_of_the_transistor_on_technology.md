The microelectronics technology timeline marks its zero hour at December 16th, 1947, with the invention of the first transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This "Game Changer" served as the foundation stone for countless modern technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Originating from research for radios, radars, and telephones, the transistor [[transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_transistors | overthrew the vacuum tube]] and ushered in the modern era of computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Beginnings and the Need for a Replacement

For a long time, AT&T and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] sought a replacement for the vacuum tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Vacuum tubes, such as the triode, were initially developed for radio, TV, and telecommunications due to their ability to rectify and amplify signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. These tubes were critical to AT&T's extensive telephone infrastructure, but they also posed significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. By the late 1940s and early 1950s, a single transcontinental phone call required 12,300 vacuum tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Primarily used as amplifiers to regenerate weakened phone signals, these tubes were large, costly, and prone to burning out, leading to poor customer experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Recognizing these limitations, AT&T began searching for a more reliable alternative as early as the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | William Shockley]] joined [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] in 1936, working in their Vacuum Tube Department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Early pre-war research focused on the copper-oxide rectifier, a device that converts AC power to DC for stable telephone power supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. A [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] scientist observed that rectifiers functioned similarly to vacuum tube amplifiers, prompting the idea of modifying them for amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | William Brattain]] and Joseph Becker were hired to explore this, but their initial experiments failed due to insufficient physics knowledge and the use of impure semiconducting materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## War and Semiconductor Advancements

World War II played a crucial role in enabling the necessary purity of materials for transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] contributed to anti-submarine research and oversaw radar system deployment during the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. While the US initially lagged behind the British in solid-state physics for [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | semiconductor technology]], the immense resources poured into wartime semiconductor research by America closed this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This included 30 to 40 laboratories dedicated to radar research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Key work involved very pure germanium and silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. In 1942, a Purdue University team led by Professor Karl Lark-Horovitz received a US government grant to produce point contact crystal rectifiers, known as "cat's whisker" detectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These detectors, pressing a thin metal wire against a semiconducting material, were advantageous for radars, especially in microwave wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. However, impurities in the semiconducting material often caused the cat's whisker part to burn out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This led to a focus on producing extremely pure crystals of germanium and silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. A single grad student, working with Eagle-Picher Company, achieved this by turning byproduct germanium into pure ingots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Post-war, companies like DuPont were producing 99.999% pure silicon, a significant leap from the pre-war 99% purity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Even though [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] shifted to wartime radar priorities, this work stimulated immense progress in [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | semiconductor research and production]], from silicon diodes to radar detectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## The First Transistor: The Point Contact Transistor

After the war, in spring 1945, Mervin Kelly became [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs']] director of research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Recognizing [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs']] leading position in solid-state physics, Kelly formed interdisciplinary research groups to develop game-changing telephone technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | William Shockley]] was made co-head of one such group, which included [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Walter Brattain]] and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | John Bardeen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

A visit to Purdue in September 1945 convinced [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]]'s team that silicon and germanium were the best materials for their research, with germanium favored for its lower melting temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. In January 1946, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] predicted that applying a strong external electrical field to a thin layer of silicon or germanium could modulate its conductivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This "field effect" could enable a three-terminal device, similar to a vacuum tube triode, to amplify a signal or act as a switch for 1s and 0s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

However, experiments to prove the field effect by [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]]'s cohorts were not working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]], the brilliant theorist, suggested that the electrical field was being blocked at the surface of the semiconducting material, preventing proper control of electrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]] and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Brattain]], a great experimentalist, began probing the germanium surface with two wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. After further experimentation, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]] proposed putting the two probes very close together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

On December 16th, 1947, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Brattain]] set up an experiment by cementing gold foil onto a polystyrene triangle, then cutting it in two at the apex with a razor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. By carefully pressing this setup onto germanium, he discovered that he could make one contact an emitter and the other a collector, achieving an amplification of approximately 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This deceptively simple setup created the first solid-state amplifier, strengthening a small signal many times over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

The discovery was demonstrated to AT&T leadership a week later, who listened to amplified speech through headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. AT&T kept the discovery secret for months to patent the design and ran it by the US military, who considered classifying it as a "Manhattan Project"-like venture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Fortunately, the general applications for the device were too broad, and the news was released on June 30th, 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The New York Times understatedly reported its "applications in radio where a vacuum tube ordinarily is employed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

This announcement sparked a global rush into the study of solid-state physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. The point contact transistor, while historically important, was largely an accidental discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Its mechanism of amplification was not well understood, even a decade later when [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]], [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Brattain]], and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] won their Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. As a commercial product, it flopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. By 1952, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs']] sister company Western Electric was making 8,400 devices a month, but major challenges emerged due to the device's fragility and susceptibility to humidity and temperature, making its performance inconsistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

## The Junction Transistor: A Superior Design

[[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bill Shockley]] was not involved in the point contact transistor experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. After eight years working on the topic, he felt frustrated and competitively driven to achieve his own breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] recognized the point contact transistor's commercial limitations and the underdeveloped theory behind it, intensifying his theoretical work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

On January 23rd, 1948, while [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]] and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Brattain]] were demonstrating their device, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] unified existing concepts and observations from the initial discovery to create the junction transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. The junction transistor consists of three sections of two types of "doped" semiconducting materials: p-type (abundance of "electron holes") and n-type (abundance of electrons) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. These can be arranged as N-P-N or P-N-P, with the base always in the middle acting like a gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. The meeting points of n-type and p-type materials are called "junctions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

[[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]]'s critical realization was that at these junctions, the majority charge carriers could travel across both junctions from the emitter to the collector, penetrating the entirety of the semiconducting material rather than just its surface layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. This concept, known as "minority carrier injection," was key to creating a far more resilient and commercially useful device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. By manipulating the current into the base, a much larger current flow through the base could be controlled, allowing for signal amplification or switching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

Initially, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] kept his idea secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. However, in February 1948, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] physicist John Shive's experimental results showed electron holes moving through the entire germanium, proving [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]]'s minority carrier injection concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. In 1950, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] chemists Gordon Teal and Morgan Sparks adopted the Czochralski process to grow pure germanium crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. This method, still used today for modern wafers, allowed them to alternatively dope the germanium crystal with p- and n-type impurities to create p-n junctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. This led to the first "grown junction transistors" in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The junction transistor was immediately seen as commercially superior due to its sturdy three-part sandwich design, unlike the fragile point contact transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

[[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] single-handedly developed a new facet of [[advancements_in_semiconductor_technology | semiconductor physics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]] had missed the concept of minority carrier injection, dismissing it as a high resistance barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]]'s book, "Electrons and Holes in Semiconductor," cemented his position as the leading figure in transistor theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. Although [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Shockley]] always clarified that [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]] and [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Brattain]] discovered the first transistor, his difficult nature led to them leaving the junction transistor research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bardeen]] later won a second Physics Nobel for his work on BCS superconductor theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

## [[commercialization_and_global_adoption_of_transistors | Commercialization and Global Adoption]]

A 1949 antitrust suit against AT&T resulted in a Consent Decree, requiring them to license their discoveries, including the transistor, to other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. For $25,000, domestic and foreign companies could buy a patent license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. In September 1951, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] held its first symposium on transistor manufacturing, providing licensees with an 800-page book and samples, nicknamed the "$25,000 book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

Existing vacuum tube companies like RCA, General Electric, Westinghouse, and Sylvania aggressively built up germanium transistor capacity, recognizing the threat to their business and developing new innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Around 1951-1952, General Electric and RCA discovered the "alloy junction transistor," which involved melting p- and n-type pellets with germanium to create junctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>. This manufacturing method was considered far more scalable than the grown junction transistor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

By 1953, the first transistorized products entered the market, notably the transistorized hearing aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. With just one transistor, it cost $229 in 1953 dollars but revolutionized the experiences of the hard-of-hearing by significantly shrinking the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. The news of the transistor quickly spread globally, with France developing its "transistron" and Japan's Electrotechnical Laboratory producing its first point contact transistor in 1951 and junction transistor in 1953 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. Japan's Sony Corporation went on to commercialize the transistor radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

## Impact on Computers

From the very beginning, people anticipated the transistor's integration into computers, expecting a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Replacing the thousands of vacuum tubes in typical 1950s computers with transistors promised smaller devices that used less energy, generated less heat, and were far more reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. However, this dream was initially delayed by challenges in scaling up reliable transistor production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

In November 1953, the University of Manchester fired up a computer with 92 first-generation point contact transistors, generally recognized as the first transistorized computer, though it still contained vacuum tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:36]</a>. Spurred by military demand, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] and other companies invested resources into developing more reliable transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. The [[commercialization_and_global_adoption_of_transistors | commercialization]] of improved alloy junction transistors and variants like Philco's "surface-barrier transistor" paved the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

In May 1954, the United States Air Force received the first American transistorized computer, "TRADIC" (TRAnsistor DIgital Computer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. With 700 transistors, TRADIC was built to evaluate if digital navigation computers could replace analog ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>. Other transistorized computers soon followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. Within a decade, the transistor evolved from a fragile lab curiosity to a component enabling flying computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. Transistorized computers marked a clear shift, becoming known as second-generation devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

By the end of 1954, [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bill Shockley]] left [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs]] to start his own business, eventually establishing Shockley Semiconductor Lab within Beckman Instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. His departure in September 1955 coincided with a decline in [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs']]] patent dominance in transistors, as former vacuum tube companies aggressively entered the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. This period marked the end of [[role_of_bell_labs_and_key_figures_in_transistor_invention | Bell Labs']]] status as the sole pioneer and the beginning of a widespread, transformative technological revolution.

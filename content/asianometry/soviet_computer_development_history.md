In 1986, the Soviet Union had over 10,000 computers, while the United States possessed 1.3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. At the time of Stalin's death, the Soviet Union was considered the world's third most proficient computing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, by the 1960s, the [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | US-Soviet computing gap]] had already grown to years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, becoming undeniable and essentially permanent twenty years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Despite the Soviet state's belief in science and industrial modernization, with plentiful support for research and development in hard sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, and achievements like launching Sputnik and landing on Venus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, a significant lag in computing emerged.

## Early Developments and Challenges

News of the ENIAC, the first general-purpose programmable computer built in the United States two years prior, reached the Soviet Union in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Though initially dismissed as propaganda, the Soviets noted the significant Western investment in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

The Soviet government recognized the need to improve calculating workflows, particularly for the nuclear weapons effort, which relied on over a hundred "calculator girls" working daily eight-hour shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Concerns arose about finding enough personnel to perform error-free calculations for tasks like differential equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Technology (ITMVT)

In 1948, the Soviet Union established the Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Technology (ITMVT) within the Soviet Academy of Sciences to explore computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. However, ITMVT's initial efforts focused on mechanical analog calculating machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This direction was largely due to the political influence of its director, General Nikolai Brevich, who believed reliable electronic general computers were impossible in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Many scientists disagreed with this approach, but voicing such concerns during the Stalin era was dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Ukrainian Initiative: MESM and BESM-1

Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Sergey Lebedev, director of the Kiev Electrotechnical Institute, learned about American digital computer efforts in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Lebedev, an electrical engineer and World War II hero, realized the importance of computers for his country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Over two years, he built his "little calculating machine," the *Mali Electrono-Machina* (MESM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Ironically named, MESM utilized approximately 6,000 vacuum tubes and occupied 60 square meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

In December 1951, MESM performed its first real calculation, solving for 585 possible values of a probability distribution function for an artillery weapons calculation table, a task requiring 250,000 calculations and two and a half hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. MESM was demonstrated to top political leaders, including future Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, who was impressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This opened the door for renegade scientists at ITMVT to reach out to Khrushchev, who then approved the removal of Nikolai Brevich, allowing ITMVT to proceed with a more powerful digital computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

This new machine, the *Bolshaya Electronia* or BESM-1, literally meaning "large calculating machine," was designed to perform 8,000 to 10,000 operations per second (8-10 kiloflops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This would have made it one of the world's fastest computers, and certainly the fastest in Europe, compared to America's leading-edge UNIVAC I, which achieved only about 1 kiloflop in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Inter-Ministry Competition: BESM-1 vs. Strela

ITMVT faced challenges delivering BESM-1 due to [[impact_of_bureaucratic_infighting_on_soviet_technological_advancements | bureaucratic infighting]]. The Ministry of Machine and Instrument Engineering had established a new institute, SKB245, for creating differential analyzers (mechanical analog computers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. However, SKB245 soon defied its mandate and proposed building its own digital high-speed computer, the Strela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

The Strela was computationally inferior to BESM-1, performing only 2 kiloflops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Despite this, its supporters argued that 10 kiloflops was unnecessary, claiming Strela could perform in 10 hours what would take a single mathematician 100,000 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. With Stalin's blessing, the two institutes competed, hindering BESM-1's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

Near the end of BESM-1's development, ITMVT required special cathode ray tubes for memory storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The only ministry producing these parts was the Ministry of Machine and Instrument Engineering (SKB245's ministry), which refused to supply the tubes for BESM-1, forcing the team to use inferior mercury storage tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

A 1951 state commission ultimately chose the Strela over BESM-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. However, users soon discovered Strela's serious issues: frequent breakdowns and inability to solve the complex quadratic equations required for fission development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. By 1955, the head of the Soviet nuclear development effort requested BESM replacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. While BESM-1 remained Europe's fastest computer for a few more years, this episode foreshadowed future [[innovation_and_industrial_challenges_in_soviet_computer_industry | Soviet issues in building a competitive computer industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## The Production Gap and Systemic Issues

Despite initial success in developing first-generation computers as fast as the West, a significant difference emerged at the production level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. In 1959, the Soviet Union produced computers worth $59 million, while the United States produced $1 billion worth of computer hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. By 1964, the USSR produced 200 million semiconductor pieces, far behind the 1.36 billion produced by the United States that same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

This production gap, more than ideological differences, was where the "battle was lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. In the Soviet command economy, the computer's full potential failed to be realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. While the military had some demand, it was limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. In the West, computer-aided automation revolutionized industries like steelmaking and manufacturing, driving massive commercial and industrial demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

Soviet steelmakers, focused on meeting quotas, had little incentive for quality or efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Consequently, Soviet computer makers lacked incentives to produce productivity-improving computers or provide necessary training and customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Ministers were reluctant to allocate resources to computer development, leading to factories frequently lacking funding, materials, and talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. For example, in 1958, the Penza computer and analytical machine plant requested 50 computer experts but received only seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This was a systemic problem; the country consistently lagged in distributing new revolutionary technologies across its economy, despite being pioneers in fields like steel-making and synthetic fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. This highlights the [[soviet_unions_historical_technology_gap | Soviet Union's historical technology gap]] in broad adoption.

## Second Generation Computers

In 1959, the West began transitioning from vacuum tubes to transistors, ushering in second-generation computer technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Transistors' reliability and smaller size transformed computers from scientific curiosities into powerful industrial tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The IBM 1401, for instance, sold over 12,000 units, driving the development of new peripherals and programming paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

The Soviets also worked on their own second-generation computers, notably the Ural series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. The true flagship was the BESM-6, the Soviet Union's first supercomputer, capable of over a million operations per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Entering production in 1967, its widespread adoption led to new software and multi-program operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. While showing great progress, the Soviets were still about two years behind the West, which was already moving to third-generation technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Third Generation and the ES Project

The advent of third-generation computers, powered by integrated circuits, marked the point where the [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | computing gap]] between the US and the Soviet Union became explicitly mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. In 1964, IBM announced the System/360, a line of compatible hardware that revolutionized the industry and became one of IBM's greatest commercial successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

In the Soviet Union, it became clear that demand for future computers was immense, and the disjointed domestic industry needed centralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Soviet newspapers like *Izvestia* (1964) and *Pravda* (1966) levied criticism, questioning if the industry could meet national computing requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

### The Decision to Copy IBM 360

While Russia historically imported foreign technologies to acquire expertise, such as in rocketry or the chemical industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, there's a risk of dependency if [[innovation_and_industrial_challenges_in_soviet_computer_industry | innovation]] cannot be self-generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

In 1967, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued Decree Resolution 1184-20 to consolidate its computing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The product was the *Yedinaya Sistema* (ES), or "Unified System," a series of unified third-generation computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. The resolution significantly increased the manufacturing budget to three billion rubles by 1975, called for 28 new plants, expansion of 22 existing ones, and production of 20,000 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

To build the ES, the ministries in charge opted to copy the IBM 360's design for software compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This was a controversial decision; some argued it would make the USSR an "intellectual colony" of the West and hinder native [[innovation_and_industrial_challenges_in_soviet_computer_industry | innovation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. A memo warned that "copying foreign work excludes the possibility of utilizing our own collective experience... and in the immediate future will hinder our ability to employ new principles. This will bring the development of computer technology in our nation to an end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

Compounding the issue, the US government forbade IBM from exporting 360 systems to the Soviet Union, meaning the Soviets would lack documentation and need to acquire systems through espionage or intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

An alternative was available: ICL (International Computers Limited), the UK's largest computer maker, offered in 1968 to share technology and documentation from their 360-compatible System 4 line of computers, even committing funds and specialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. This offered 360 software compatibility, British programming methods, and some industrial sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. However, working with ICL would delay the project by at least 1.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, a politically difficult prospect given the existing [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | Soviet-American computer gap]], especially in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. The [[impact_of_cold_war_technology_race_on_computing | Cold War technology race]] pressure played a role, and the East German government had already begun copying the IBM 360, making a change in direction politically complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

This copying decision, documented in meeting notes, had tragic, long-lasting consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Several prominent computer scientists resigned in protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Sergey Lebedev himself attempted to reverse the decision but failed, efforts that are said to have hastened his death in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

### Implementation and Consequences of the ES Project

Over 100 organizations, 46,000 scientists, and 300,000 workers across Poland, East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Czechoslovakia contributed to developing the ES <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Over 15,000 ES pieces were created, with much of the hardware produced through reverse engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. However, peripherals, particularly disk storage, fell short of Western alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

While the ES's 360 compatibility did accelerate Soviet capabilities in the short term, with CIA estimates in the 1970s suggesting the [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | computing gap]] shrank from 10-15 years to about 4-6 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, this gain led to long-term loss. By the 1980s, the Soviet industry struggled to reverse-engineer increasingly complex Western computers, widening the gap again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The Soviets had lost the native industrial capacity to develop new technology on their own, making the gap permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

Industrial productivity suffered as 1970s computers aged and frequently broke down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. By 1989, a quarter of all Soviet general-purpose computers were ES-1022s, made in 1974 but based on 1965 technology, meaning they were 24 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. This reliance on foreign technology also caused issues when the US and West levied export bans on advanced technologies during international crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

## Conclusion

The fall of the Soviet computing industry is characterized by wasted talents, lost progress, foolish short-term strategic choices made by politicians over scientists, and the inherent limits of centralized planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. Although technology transfers helped somewhat, the [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | gap remained]] and was never fully closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

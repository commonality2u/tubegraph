In 1986, the Soviet Union possessed just over 10,000 computers, a stark contrast to the 1.3 million in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While the Soviet Union was the world's third most proficient computing power at the time of Stalin's death, by the 1960s, the computing gap with the U.S. was already years long, becoming "undeniable and basically permanent" twenty years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

Despite the Soviet state's belief in science and industrial modernization, plentiful support for research and development in hard sciences, and having the country's finest minds—evidenced by achievements like launching Sputnik and landing on Venus—the computing sector lagged significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Early Soviet Computing Efforts (1940s-1950s)

News of the ENIAC, the first general-purpose programmable computer built in the United States two years prior, reached the Soviet Union in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. While initially dismissed by many as propaganda, the Soviets observed the West's significant investment in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

The Soviet government had a pressing need to improve calculating workflows; for example, the nuclear weapons effort required over 100 "calculator girls" working daily eight-hour shifts on calculations, raising concerns about finding enough people for error-free work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

In 1948, the Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Technology (ITMVT) was established within the Soviet Academy of Sciences to explore computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. However, its initial focus was on mechanical analog calculating machines due to the political influence of its director, General Nikolai Brevich, who believed reliable electronic general computers were impossible in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Voicing concerns against this party directive during the Stalin era was dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### The MESM and BESM-1

Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Sergey Lebedev, director of the Kiev Electro-technical Institute and a decorated electrical engineer, learned of American digital computer efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Recognizing its importance, Lebedev spent two years building his "little calculating machine," the Mali Electrono Machina (MESM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Ironically named, it contained about 6,000 vacuum tubes and occupied 60 square meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. In December 1951, MESM performed its first real calculation, solving for 585 possible values of a probability distribution function for an artillery weapons calculation table, requiring 250,000 calculations over two and a half hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

The MESM's demonstration to top political leaders, including future Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, in late 1949, impressed him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This success allowed "renegade scientists" at the ITMVT to reach out to Khrushchev, who approved the removal of Brevich and allowed ITMVT to proceed with a more powerful digital computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

This led to the development of the Bolshaya Electronia (BESM-1), meaning "large calculating machine." Capable of 8,000 to 10,000 operations per second (8 to 10 kiloflops), BESM-1 would have been one of the world's fastest computers, and certainly the fastest in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. For comparison, the UNIVAC I, a leading American machine in 1951, managed only about one kiloflop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Internal Competition and Production Challenges

ITMVT faced struggles in delivering BESM-1 due to competition from SKB245, an institute previously tasked with making mechanical analog computers (differential analyzers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. SKB245, going against its mandate, proposed building its own digital computer, the Strela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. While computationally inferior to BESM-1 (two kiloflops versus 8-10), Strela's supporters argued its capabilities were sufficient, even if it took 10 hours to do what a mathematician would take 100,000 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

With Stalin's blessing, the two institutes competed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Near its completion, BESM-1 required cathode ray tubes for memory storage, but the sole ministry producing them—the Ministry of Machine and Instrument Engineering, which oversaw SKB245—refused to supply them, forcing the BESM-1 team to use inferior mercury storage tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. A 1951 state commission eventually chose Strela over BESM-1, possibly due to its "flashy lights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

However, actual users soon found serious issues with Strela: it broke down frequently and could not solve the complex quadratic equations needed for fission development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. By 1955, the head of the Soviet nuclear development effort requested BESM replacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. BESM-1 remained Europe's fastest computer for a few more years, but this effort highlighted future Soviet challenges in building competitive computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## The Widening Gap: Production and Systemic Issues

While the Soviets successfully developed a first-generation computer as quickly as the West, and arguably a better one, the story at the production level was vastly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. In 1959, the Soviet Union produced computers worth $59 million, compared to the United States' $1 billion in computer hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. By 1964, the Soviet Union produced 200 million semiconductor pieces, far behind the U.S.'s 1.36 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

The core reason for the Soviet computing industry's failure was its inability to [[challenges_in_soviet_computer_production | produce enough good computers fast enough]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. In the [[role_of_computers_and_cybernetics_in_soviet_economic_planning | Soviet command economy]], computers failed to reach their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Unlike the West, where commercial and industrial demand for computer-aided automation (e.g., in steelmaking) drove significant growth, Soviet industries operated on quotas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. A Soviet steelmaker only needed to meet a quota, with no incentives for steel quality or production efficiency, thus eliminating the demand for productivity-improving computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

Soviet computer makers also lacked incentives to provide necessary training and customer service, leading ministers to be reluctant to allocate resources to computer development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Factories often lacked funding, materials, and talent; for example, in 1958, the Penza computer plant, one of only two at the time, requested 50 computer experts but received just seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

This was a [[soviet_industrial_growth_and_technological_lag | systemic problem]] across the country, which had long lagged in distributing new revolutionary technologies internally, despite being pioneers in areas like steel-making and synthetic fibers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Second Generation (Transistors)

In 1959, the West began transitioning to transistors, ushering in second-generation computer technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The transistor's reliability and smaller size transformed computers into powerful industrial tools, exemplified by the IBM 1401, which sold over 12,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

The Soviets also worked on their own second-generation computers, including the Ural series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. The flagship was the BESM-6, the Soviet Union's first supercomputer, capable of over a million operations per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. It entered production in 1967 and was widely adopted, leading to new software and multi-program operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. At this point, the Soviets delivered first and second-generation computers about two years behind the West, a noticeable but not catastrophic gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

## Third Generation (Integrated Circuits) and the "Permanent Gap"

The situation changed with third-generation computers powered by integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. The first mentions of a significant computing gap between the U.S. and the Soviet Union began here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

In 1964, IBM announced the System/360, a complete line of computer hardware with backward and forward compatibility, revolutionizing the industry by protecting software investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. In the Soviet Union, it became clear that future computer demand had a "seemingly limitless ceiling," and the domestic industry needed to step up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Public criticism mounted; in 1964, Izvestia criticized the disjointed computer efforts, and in 1966, Pravda questioned the industry's readiness, stating, "unfortunately we must state that the situation is far from optimistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

### [[Strategic decisions in Soviet computing industry | The Decision to Copy IBM]]

Historically, Russia had imported foreign technologies to acquire expertise, such as in rocketry or the chemical industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. However, there's a risk: if technology transfer fails to generate self-innovation, it can lead to an "uncontrollable and irreversible addiction to the imported technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

In 1967, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued Resolution 1184-20 to consolidate its computing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The outcome was the ES (Unified System) project, a series of unified third-generation computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This resolution boosted the budget tenfold to three billion rubles by 1975, calling for 28 new plants, expansion of 22 existing ones, and production of 20,000 computers by 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

To build the ES, the ministries decided to copy the IBM 360's design for software compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This was a controversial [[strategic_decisions_in_soviet_computing_industry | strategic decision]], with some arguing it would make the USSR an "intellectual colony of the West" and hinder native innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

> "Copying foreign work excludes the possibility of utilizing our own collective experience of computer research and in the immediate future will hinder our ability to employ new principles. This will bring the development of computer technology in our nation to an end." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>

This assessment proved largely correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. The U.S. government forbade IBM from exporting 360 systems to the Soviet Union, forcing the Soviets to acquire systems through espionage or intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

An alternative was available: ICL, the UK's largest computer maker, offered to share technology and documentation from their 360-compatible System 4 line in 1968, even committing funds and specialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. This would have allowed 360 software compatibility while retaining some industrial sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. However, working with ICL would delay the project by at least 1.5 years, a politically difficult prospect given the existing Soviet-American computer gap, especially in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. The Communist Party had made it a high political priority, and the East German government was already copying the IBM 360, making a change of direction politically fraught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

The [[strategic_decisions_in_soviet_computing_industry | copying decision]] had tragic, long-lasting consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Several prominent computer scientists resigned in protest, and Sergey Lebedev's attempts to reverse the decision reportedly hastened his death in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

The ES project involved over 100 organizations, 46,000 scientists, and 300,000 workers across CMEA countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Over 15,000 ES pieces were created, mostly through reverse engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. While software compatibility did accelerate Soviet capabilities, with CIA estimates in the 1970s suggesting the gap shrank from 10-15 years to 4-6 years, this short-term gain led to a long-term loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

By the 1980s, the Soviet industry struggled to reverse engineer increasingly complex Western computers, widening the gap once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. The Soviets had lost the native industrial capacity to develop anything new on their own, making the gap "permanent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. Industrial productivity suffered as aging computers (e.g., 24-year-old ES-1022s made in 1974 from a 1965 technology) frequently broke down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Linkage to foreign technology also caused issues when the U.S. and West imposed export bans during international crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

Despite the technology transfers, the gap remained, and the Soviets were never able to fully close it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. The fall of the Soviet computing industry is characterized as a story of [[challenges_in_soviet_computer_production | wasted talents]], lost progress, [[strategic_decisions_in_soviet_computing_industry | foolish short-term strategic choices]] made by politicians over scientists, and the limits of [[role_of_computers_and_cybernetics_in_soviet_economic_planning | centralized planning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

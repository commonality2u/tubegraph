Evergrande Group, a sprawling company with billions of dollars in debt and a cash crunch, is currently seeking a way out of its financial difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article explores the rise and fall of what was once China's largest real estate conglomerate, now facing approximately $300 billion in liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Founder's Early Life and Career
Evergrande's founder and former chairman, Xu Jiayin, was born in 1958, the son of a farmer and a veteran of the Second Sino-Japanese War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. His mother died of sepsis when he was eight months old due to the family's poverty and inability to afford medical treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

At 16, in 1974, Xu graduated high school. With college entrance exams closed, he started his first business selling building materials on the street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. He then held various rural jobs, including cement factory worker, village security officer, and tractor driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

In 1978, Xu took the *gaokao* (college entrance exam) for the second time, ranking third out of 10 million students in Zoko City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This achievement granted him entrance to Wuhan University of Science and Technology, where he graduated with honors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. After graduation, he married Yang Huaying, who also came from an impoverished background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Xu then worked at the Ghanan Wu Yang Iron and Steel Company, serving as an assistant director of the heat treatment workshop, responsible for over 300 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. He managed with a firm hand but also prioritized worker welfare, which led to high performance in his workshop and raised his profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. After 10 years at the company, seven as a director, Xu left after being investigated for selling scrap metal during his downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. He stated he was doing it to clear the floor and earn more money for his workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

He then joined Shenzhen Dongdak Group, a trading company, as a salesperson, quickly rising to office director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Xu was a "go-getter" who made an immediate impact, shepherding a steel trading alliance with his former company, Wu Yang Iron and Steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He also implemented a double salary system, offering top workers a bonus equivalent to a full year's salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### First Foray into Real Estate
In 1994, Xu advocated for Zhongda to enter the real estate market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. With company approval, he moved to Guangzhou with four workers (a driver, cashier, salesman, and handyman) to develop the "Du Dao Garden" (Pearl Island Garden) project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

The team rented fancy hotel rooms to strike deals and advertised to attract customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The company adopted a low-cost, high-value design, differentiating itself from the massive luxury units prevalent at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This made premium real estate accessible to the middle class for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. By mid-1997, two years after entering real estate, Pearl Island Garden generated a profit of $31 million for Dongda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Despite this success, Xu's salary was only $450 a month, which was over five times a civil servant's salary but still far from the value he brought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. After his request for a raise was rejected by Dongda's CEO, Xu left to start his own venture at around 39 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Founding of Evergrande Group
In 1997, Xu founded Evergrande Industrial Group in Guangzhou as a real estate company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Its Chinese and English names both mean "endless from the past into the present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. With just eight employees, Xu searched Guangzhou for prime development land, competing with major developers like Vanki, Dali, Wanda, and Country Garden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Jinbe Garden: The First Project
Xu persevered, and Evergrande's first project was Jinbe Garden, built on the site of an old pesticide plant on Industrial Avenue in the Hanzhu District <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The 110,000 square meter plot had issues such as too many factories, a lack of urban infrastructure, and serious pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. These problems allowed Xu to acquire the plot at an extremely low price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

Even so, Evergrande could not afford the required 5 million RMB down payment, but convinced the government to allow installment payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This marked the beginning of Evergrande's reliance on debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. They borrowed 6 million RMB from a bank, using 5 million for the down payment and the remaining 1 million to start construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Jinbe Garden broke ground in June 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Two months later, in August 1997, the first round of housing sales opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Units were sold at 2,800 RMB per square meter (about $40 USD per square foot), which was below cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This pricing strategy was a sensation, selling out in just two hours, with people lining up day and night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The company made 80 million RMB ($12 million USD) in sales, securing its "first bucket of gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Business Strategies and Expansion
Evergrande quickly began development on 13 other projects in Guangzhou simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. By 1999, just two years after its founding, Evergrande was Guangzhou's seventh-largest real estate company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. They rapidly expanded, refining their internal procedures and business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

In 2006, Evergrande began its national expansion, deploying 200 employees to Wuhan, Shenyang, Chongqing, and Chengdu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. The goal was to replicate "20 Evergrandes" in three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. By this time, the company had total assets of 7.8 billion RMB ($1.2 billion USD) and 6.8 billion RMB ($1 billion USD) in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### The "Three Highs, One Low" Strategy
Xu implemented the same [[business_strategies_and_expansion_of_evergrande | business strategy]] for Jinbe Garden and subsequent projects that he first used at Pearl Island Garden: small units in previously underdeveloped areas, priced for the middle class, and built extremely quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

Their development process involved selling significant debt to raise funds for land acquisition, building and selling units quickly to recover initial investments, and then reinvesting most sales back into more land purchases and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Evergrande's early strategy during these high-growth years was summarized by the slogan "*san gao yidi*" (three highs, one low):
*   **High debt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
*   **High leverage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
*   **High turnover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
*   **Low cost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>

This high debt strategy was precarious, keeping Evergrande on a "razor's edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. However, without it, the company could not acquire its massive land bank, which was the country's fastest appreciating asset at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. As long as land prices rose, the company could stay ahead of its debt costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

A significant portion of Evergrande's liabilities came from customer deposits for future homes, not just borrowings like bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Unlike bank deposits, customer deposits for homes carry a much higher risk of forced withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Furthermore, over 50% of Evergrande's debt was classified as current, meaning it could be called for repayment within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. A major risk was needing cash to pay current liabilities during a financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

## Financial Challenges and IPO
The 2008 global financial crisis triggered fears of a real estate crisis in China, plunging Evergrande into turbulent waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. The company was in the midst of its national expansion, spending heavily to acquire valuable land plots in China's first and second-tier cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Its land bank had grown ninefold since 2006, but with 37 projects underway, Evergrande struggled with cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. At this time, Evergrande owed approximately 12 to 15 billion RMB (around $2 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

Evergrande's initial plan to pay down this debt was to go public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. However, the global financial crisis halted this plan, forcing Xu to scramble for funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. After his first choice, Wang of Vanka, turned him down, Xu sought help from Cheng Yu-tung of Chao Tyfook Group, one of Hong Kong's wealthiest business families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Cheng decided to invest over $150 million USD as a lead investor in a pre-IPO $500 million USD investment round to bail out Evergrande <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Other investors included Deutsche Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and the Kuwait Investment Authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This allowed the company to stabilize its business and continue its projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

In November 2009, the IPO proceeded in Hong Kong, with shares rising 34% on the first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Xu held a 68% stake in Evergrande, which, at the company's $10 billion USD valuation, pegged his wealth at over $6 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. By the end of 2009, Evergrande had total assets of 63 billion RMB ($9.8 billion USD) and total liabilities of 50 billion RMB ($7.8 billion USD), still operating on a "razor's edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

## Diversification and Expansion beyond Real Estate
Xu Jiayin's ambition to build an empire was clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. A year after the IPO, Evergrande spent 100 million RMB ($15 million USD) to acquire the Guangzhou Football Club, a member of the Chinese Super League <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Evergrande stabilized the club's rocky ownership and brought it great success, including seven straight Chinese Super League championships and the 2013 Asian Champions League title, making it the first Chinese team to do so in 23 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

During this period, Evergrande also officially moved into the consumer goods industry with its mineral water product, Evergrande Beanchen (Evergrande Ice Spring) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Marketing claimed the water came from deep mineral springs of Changbai Mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Xu set ambitious sales targets for Ice Spring: 10 billion RMB ($1.5 billion USD) in 2014, and 30 billion RMB ($4.6 billion USD) by 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. The brand struggled to make a profit despite high gross margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. In 2016, Evergrande sold its shares in the mineral water business and other food products for about 2.7 billion RMB ($405 million USD), offloading 3.3 billion RMB ($510 million USD) in debt in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

In mid-2014, Xu unveiled a new [[business_strategies_and_expansion_of_evergrande | strategy]]: "diversity plus scale plus brand," aiming to diversify the company's operations beyond real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Three months later, Evergrande acquired Yen-Chen Plastic Surgery, a chain of clinics, with Xu's wife, Yan Huaying, placed in charge of its operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Other acquisitions followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

### Strategic Reversal: "Three Lows, One High"
In early 2017, Xu announced a major change in Evergrande's [[business_strategies_and_expansion_of_evergrande | business strategy]]. At this time, the company's total liabilities were 1.15 trillion RMB ($178 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. He replaced the "three highs, one low" strategy with a reversal: "sandi" or "three lows, one high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>:
*   **Low debt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>
*   **Low leverage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>
*   **Low cost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>
*   **High turnover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>

The goal was to lower debt ratios and increase total net assets, aligning with the Chinese government's pronouncements about de-leveraging the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

### Government Ties and Allegations of Influence
Xu Jiayin's close ties to the government became apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. He is considered China's most generous individual in terms of charity, winning the China Charity Award for eight consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. In 2018 and 2019, he reportedly donated 4 billion RMB ($620 million USD) in cash each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. This philanthropy was seen as buying influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

Evergrande's influence became evident during the 2012 incident with Andrew Left of Citron Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Left published a report claiming Evergrande was insolvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Hong Kong authorities launched a years-long civil case against him, banning him from trading in Hong Kong for five years in 2016, a ban he lost his last appeal for in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. In 2021, Left admitted he would not have gotten involved if he had known how powerful Xu was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

The 2017 strategy turnaround led to various debt reduction measures, including asset sales and fundraising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. At the end of 2017, Evergrande reported net profits rising 110% to 37 billion RMB ($5.7 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. While some news reports stated the net debt ratio declined, total liabilities actually rose from 1.1 trillion RMB ($170 billion USD) in 2016 to 1.5 trillion RMB ($232 billion USD) in 2017, with total borrowings increasing from 532 billion RMB ($82 billion USD) to $113 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

Evergrande felt it had demonstrated its profitability and became China's most profitable real estate company, earning a spot in the Fortune 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. This period mirrored Amazon's strategy of showing rising profits after years of minimal returns to prove its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

## Entry into High-Tech and EVs
The "diet" did not last long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. In 2018, with the US crippling Chinese telecommunications company ZTE with technology export sanctions, the Chinese government reshuffled its priorities due to the industry's over-reliance on American technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Xu seized this opportunity, announcing Evergrande's entry into the high-tech industry, including quantum computing, AI, life sciences, and new energy vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

Xu initially tried to acquire American EV company Faraday Future, but after the deal fell through, Evergrande decided to go it alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. In November 2019, Evergrande announced a 45 billion RMB ($7 billion USD) investment over three years to develop electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. Instead of founding a new subsidiary, they renamed their Hong Kong-listed health company, Evergrande Health Industry Group Limited, to Evergrande Auto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This company was a "Frankenstein's monster" formed from a Hong Kong-listed gossip magazine publisher, merged with hospital chains and plastic surgery clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

In August 2020, Evergrande Auto unveiled six vehicles under its "Hang Qi" brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>, announcing that the first model would hit the market a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. A month later, the company raised $500 million USD in investment from Tencent, ride-hailing company Didi, Sequoia Capital, and Jack Ma's personal investment fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. Evergrande Auto also struck deals with Guang Huy Group (China's biggest automobile dealer) for a sales network and with State Grid Corporation of China for charging stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>.

The Hong Kong stock surged due to these announcements and general EV market euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. By April 2021, the auto subsidiary was valued at nearly $90 billion, exceeding American automaker Ford Motors at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. This was considered a bubble, as Evergrande Auto had not yet sold a single car and was losing billions of RMB annually, earning more from plastic surgery than EVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. The company also invested heavily in three production facilities in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Guangzhou <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Eventually, the stock crashed by over 95% due to the group's wider troubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

## The "Three Red Lines" Policy
Chinese financial authorities had long been concerned about contagion threats in the financial sector from massive conglomerates like Evergrande, Fosan Group, and Anbang Insurance Group, which were largely funded by borrowed money and off-balance sheet arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>.

In August 2020, after interviewing 12 real estate companies, two ministries passed regulations mandating "the three red lines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>:
1.  A percentage ceiling on the ratio of liabilities to assets of 70% (excluding advances from contracted projects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
2.  A cap on the percentage of net debt to equity of 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
3.  A requirement to hold at least one dollar of cash for each dollar borrowed in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

Real estate companies that failed to meet these requirements would not be allowed to add more debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.

Evergrande's metrics at the time the law was passed were:
*   **Liabilities to asset ratio:** 82% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>
*   **Net debt to equity percentage:** 199% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>
*   **Ratio of cash to short-term borrowings:** 0.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>

> [!WARNING] Evergrande was far beyond the red lines, indicating severe [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | financial challenges and debt of Evergrande]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>

This policy change seemed to catch Xu and the company off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. Weeks later, Xu announced that Evergrande would slash prices on its 600-plus new builds nationwide by 30%, aiming for monthly sales of 100 billion RMB ($15.4 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. While the company had offered discounts before (e.g., 78% during the March 2020 pandemic crisis), this marked a significant shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

## The Leaked Letter and Intensifying Crisis
In September 2020, a Chinese website leaked a letter purportedly sent by Evergrande to the Guangdong provincial government, titled "Report on Requesting Support for Major Asset Restructuring Projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. While Evergrande called it fake, some news sources confirmed its authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

The letter re-emphasized Evergrande's adherence to government real estate price reduction policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>. It stated that the company's interest-bearing liabilities had reached about 835 billion RMB ($130 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>:
*   232 billion RMB ($35.8 billion USD) owed to 128 domestic banks, with the biggest being Minsheng Bank and Agricultural Bank of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>.
*   368 billion RMB ($56.9 billion USD) owed to 121 non-banking entities (real estate funds, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.
*   The remainder owed to various domestic and offshore bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.

The report requested the Guangdong government's help in coordinating a reorganization of Evergrande's entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. The key point was that if the reorganization wasn't completed by February 2021, Evergrande would owe strategic investors 130 billion RMB ($20 billion USD) and 13.7 billion RMB ($2.2 billion USD) in dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. This could trigger a sudden cash flow crunch and jeopardize the company's [[financial_challenges_and_debt_of_evergrande | financial health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>.

## Current Situation and Outlook
Since the leaked letter, there has been a flurry of news, including debt downgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:30]</a>. Shares dropped over 68%, and debt lost more than half its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. The company is trying to find new funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.

Evergrande's 2020 annual report showed approximately 1.95 trillion RMB (about $300 billion USD) in liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. While Evergrande has 1.9 trillion RMB in assets on its balance sheet, much of these are land bank assets or houses under construction, which are not easily converted to cash unless vendors and construction crews are paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.

Additional concerns include obligations from Evergrande Wealth Management fund products, high-yielding interest products primarily sold to employees who then resell them to friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. Approximately 40 billion RMB ($6.2 billion USD) of these products are outstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>. On September 8, 2021, two Evergrande affiliates missed repayments on these obligations, leading to protests at Evergrande's headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>. Five days later, Evergrande announced repayment options, including cash (with a waiting period), payment in kind (land), or credit for future home purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. Many investors remained unhappy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:19">[00:30:19]</a>.

A significant issue is Evergrande's off-balance sheet liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. The group has various subsidiaries not fully consolidated (owning less than 51% stock) but which represent themselves as Evergrande companies and whose debts are implicitly backed by the main group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. The full extent of these liabilities is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.

Amidst this turmoil, Xu Jiayin resigned as Evergrande's chairman on August 17, 2021, with Zhao Tanglong stepping up as chairman, general manager, and legal representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

> [!INFO] **Outlook (as of transcript)**
> The Evergrande situation is ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. The government is unlikely to bail out the company, as Evergrande is not a bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. It is expected to undergo debt resolution in court and be slowly broken up, similar to how other companies have been handled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>. Concerns remain about the [[impact_and_consequences_of_evergrandes_financial_issues | effect Evergrande's winding down]] will have on its hundreds of new builds and the broader Chinese real estate market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. Lower real estate prices would align with the government's social equality goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.

Non-performing real estate loans remain low across the overall financial system, indicating capacity to absorb losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>. The bigger challenge for [[regulatory_and_government_interactions_with_evergrande | state regulators]] is to contain the damage from off-balance sheet issues before it causes a systemic crisis of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. Regulators have successfully handled other massive conglomerates in crisis before, such as Anbang Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>. It remains to be seen if Xu Jiayin will face charges for the turmoil caused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>.

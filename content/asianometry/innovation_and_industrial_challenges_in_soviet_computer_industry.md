By 1986, the Soviet Union possessed just over 10,000 computers, a stark contrast to the 1.3 million held by the Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While the Soviet Union was the world's third most proficient computing power at the time of Stalin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, a significant gap emerged by the 1960s, becoming "undeniable and basically permanent" twenty years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

Despite the Soviet state's belief in science and industrial modernization, plentiful support for research and development in hard sciences, and having top minds capable of launching Sputnik and landing on Venus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, its computing industry lagged.

## Early Soviet Computing Efforts

News of the ENIAC, the first general-purpose programmable computer built in the United States, reached the Soviet Union in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Though initially dismissed by many as propaganda due to limited knowledge of its vacuum tube operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, the Soviet government recognized the need to improve calculating workflows. For instance, the nuclear weapons effort required over 100 "calculator girls" working daily eight-hour shifts on calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, prompting concerns about finding enough people for error-free work on complex equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

In 1948, the Soviet Union established the Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Technology (ITMVT) within the Soviet Academy of Sciences to explore computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. However, early ITMVT efforts focused on mechanical analog calculating machines due to the political influence of its director, General Nikolai Brevich, who believed reliable electronic general computers were impossible in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Sergey Lebedev and the MESM

A different path emerged in Ukraine. In 1948, Sergey Lebedev, director of the Kiev Electrotechnical Institute, learned of American digital computer efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Lebedev, an electrical engineer and World War II hero known for developing a tank gun stabilization system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, built his own "little calculating machine," the Mali Electrono Machina (MESM), over the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Ironically, MESM had about 6,000 vacuum tubes and occupied 60 square meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

On December 1951, MESM completed its first real calculation, solving for 585 values of a probability distribution function for an artillery weapons calculation table, requiring 250,000 calculations and two and a half hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Its demonstration to top political leaders, including future Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev, in late 1949, impressed him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This success allowed "renegade scientists" at ITMVT to reach out to Khrushchev, leading to the deposition of Brevich and the approval for ITMVT to develop a more powerful digital computer, the Bolshaya Electronia Machina (BESM-1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### The BESM-1 and Bureaucratic Competition

The BESM-1, meaning "large calculating machine," was capable of 8,000 to 10,000 operations per second (8 to 10 kiloflops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This would have made it one of the world's fastest computers, certainly the fastest in Europe, compared to the UNIVAC I, which was one of America's leading-edge machines in 1951 and only capable of about one kiloflop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

However, ITMVT struggled to deliver BESM-1 due to [[impact_of_bureaucratic_infighting_on_soviet_technological_advancements|bureaucratic infighting]]. The Ministry of Machine and Instrument Engineering had established its own institute, SKB245, initially for mechanical analog computers, which soon proposed building its own digital high-speed computer, the Strela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Strela was computationally inferior to BESM-1 (2 kiloflops vs. 8-10 kiloflops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, but its supporters made bizarre arguments for its sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

With Stalin's blessing, the two institutes competed, hurting BESM's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. ITMVT needed special cathode ray tubes for memory storage, but the sole ministry making them was SKB245's. They refused to supply the tubes for BESM-1, forcing the team to use inferior mercury storage tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. A 1951 state commission chose Strela over BESM-1, possibly due to "flashy lights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

Actual users soon discovered Strela's serious issues: frequent breakdowns and inability to solve complicated quadratic equations needed for fission development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. By 1955, the head of the Soviet nuclear development effort requested BESM replacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. BESM-1 remained Europe's fastest computer for a few more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. While the Soviets successfully developed a first-generation computer as fast as the West, and arguably better, this effort foreshadowed future industrial issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## The Production Gap: A Systemic Problem

While the Soviets and Americans appeared neck-and-neck at the leading edge, the production level told a different story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. In 1959, the Soviet Union produced computers worth $59 million, but the United States produced $1 billion of computer hardware that same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. By 1964, the USSR produced 200 million semiconductor pieces, while the US produced 1.36 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This production disparity, "far more relevant than any hostile ideology," was where the battle was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

[[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing|The Soviet command economy]] failed to fully realize the computer's potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. While the military had some demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, the West saw "titanic commercial and industrial demand" driven by computer-aided automation in industries like steelmaking and manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. In the Soviet system:
*   **Lack of Incentive:** Soviet steelmakers only needed to meet quotas, with no emphasis on steel quality or production efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. This meant Soviet computer makers had little incentive to produce productivity-improving computers or provide necessary training and customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Ministers were reluctant to allocate limited resources to computer development due to a failure to see its full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Factories often lacked funding, materials, and talent. For example, in 1958, the Penza computer plant, one of only two in the USSR, requested 50 experts but received only seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Distribution Challenges:** This was a systemic problem; the country consistently lagged in distributing revolutionary technologies like steel-making and synthetic fibers, despite being pioneers in some fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Second and Third Generation Challenges

The West transitioned from vacuum tubes to transistors (second-generation computer technology) around 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The transistor's reliability and smaller size transformed computers into powerful industrial tools, exemplified by the IBM 1401, which sold over 12,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This spurred development of new peripherals and programming paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

The Soviets also developed their second-generation computers, notably the Ural series and the BESM-6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. The BESM-6, the Soviet Union's first [[technological_innovations_and_challenges_in_supercomputer_design|supercomputer]] capable of over a million operations per second, entered production in 1967 and saw extensive use, leading to new software and multi-program operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. At this point, the Soviets were delivering computers about two years behind the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

However, this changed with third-generation computers, powered by integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This is when the "computing gap" between the US and USSR began to be explicitly mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. In 1964, IBM announced the System/360, a revolutionary line of computers with backward and forward compatibility, which became one of IBM's greatest commercial successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. In the Soviet Union, it became clear that demand for computers had a "seemingly limitless ceiling," and the domestic industry needed to step up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## The ES (Unified System) Project and Copying Western Technology

Public criticism grew within the Soviet Union. In 1964, *Izvestia* levied the first major criticism of the country's computer efforts, highlighting a disjointed industry needing centralization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Two years later, *Pravda* questioned if the industry could meet national economic requirements, concluding, "unfortunately we must state that the situation is far from optimistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

Russia historically imported foreign technologies to acquire expertise, as seen in rocketry (from German scientists and war booty) and the chemical industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. However, there's a risk: if technology transfer fails to foster self-generated innovation, it can lead to "an uncontrollable and irreversible addiction to the imported technology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

In 1967, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued Resolution 1184-20 to consolidate its computing industry into the ES (Unified System) project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. This resolution dramatically increased the computing manufacturing budget tenfold to three billion rubles by 1975, directed the construction of 28 new computer plants, expansion of 22 existing ones, and a target of 20,000 computers by 1975 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

To build the ES, the ministries in charge opted to copy an American IBM 360 model's design to ensure compatibility with 360 software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This was a controversial decision. Critics argued it would make the USSR an "intellectual colony of the West" and hinder future innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. One memo stated that copying foreign work "will bring the development of computer technology in our nation to an end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

Furthermore, the US government forbade IBM from exporting 360 systems to the Soviet Union, meaning the Soviets would lack adequate documentation and rely on espionage or intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. An alternative existed: ICL, the UK's largest computer maker, offered to share technology and documentation from their 360-compatible System 4 line, willing to commit significant funds and specialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. This offered 360 software compatibility while retaining some industrial sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. However, working with ICL would delay the project by at least 1.5 years, a politically difficult prospect given the existing [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements|Soviet-American computer gap]], especially in software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Additionally, [[industrial_challenges_faced_by_east_germany_in_semiconductor_production|East Germany]] had already begun efforts to copy the IBM 360, making a change of direction politically problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

The decision to copy had "tragic long lasting consequences" on the [[soviet_computer_development_history|Soviet computing industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Several prominent computer scientists resigned in protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>, and Sergey Lebedev's failed attempts to reverse the decision are said to have hastened his death in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

## Outcomes and Permanent Gap

Over 100 organizations, 46,000 scientists, and 300,000 workers across Poland, East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Czechoslovakia contributed to developing the ES <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Over 15,000 pieces were created, with much hardware reverse-engineered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. However, peripherals, particularly disk storage solutions, fell short of Western alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

Software-wise, the ES's 360 compatibility did accelerate Soviet capabilities. CIA estimates in the 1970s suggested the computing gap shrank from 10-15 years in the mid-1960s to about 4-6 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

However, this short-term gain led to a long-term loss. Starting in the 1980s, the Soviet industry struggled to reverse-engineer increasingly complicated Western computers, widening the gap once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. The Soviets had lost the "native industrial capacity to develop anything new on their own," making the gap "permanent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. Industrial productivity suffered as the 1970s-era computers aged and frequently broke down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. By 1989, a quarter of the Soviet Union's 13,613 general-purpose computers were ES-1022s, made in 1974 but copying technology from 1965 – effectively 24 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

The reliance on foreign technology also caused issues when the United States and the West levied export bans on advanced technologies during international crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. While some US policymakers feared selling technology would help the Soviets close the gap, the transfer ultimately did not enable the Soviets to fully close it, especially given their human capital shortages for complex software like IBM 360 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

The decline of the [[challenges_faced_by_the_soviet_economy_in_its_later_years|Soviet computing industry]] was a story of wasted talents, lost progress, "foolish short-term strategic choices made by politicians over scientists, and the limits of centralized planning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

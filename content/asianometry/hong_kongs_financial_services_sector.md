Hong Kong has undergone a significant economic transformation, shifting its focus from manufacturing to a service-based economy, with a particular emphasis on finance and trading. This shift has been described as a "demanufacturing" of the economy [00:00:22], a process some consider to be its biggest mistake [00:00:24].

## Historical Context and Economic Shift
After the Chinese Civil War, industrialists from Shanghai, alongside a large number of refugees, relocated to Hong Kong to escape the Communist Party of China [00:01:01]. These industrialists brought capital and manufacturing expertise, establishing factories to take advantage of the labor opportunities provided by a million or so Chinese migrants [00:01:10]. Due to limited land, factories produced lightly manufactured items like plastic flowers, clothes, and radio assemblies in high-rise buildings [00:01:27].

Hong Kong's manufacturing industry thrived in the 1950s as the United States and other Western nations began outsourcing manufactured goods from Asia [00:01:40]. By the early 1960s, Hong Kong was the largest manufacturer in the developing world [00:01:56]. However, competition soon emerged from places like [[political_and_financial_environment_in_south_korea | South Korea]] and Taiwan, leading to rising costs as worker salaries improved [00:02:10]. Hong Kong's manufacturing largely offered only cheap labor, lacking technological expertise for native technologies, necessitating imports of critical components like integrated circuits from Japan [00:02:30]. This made the industry uncompetitive [00:02:53].

Unlike Taiwan, Singapore, and [[political_and_financial_environment_in_south_korea | South Korea]], whose governments invested in acquiring and naturalizing technologies, Hong Kong's British colonial administration had a non-interventionist stance [00:03:04]. The government's primary source of revenue was land leases, as it held superior title to all land [00:03:47]. This fiscal strategy created incentives for an economy centered on ever-rising land prices and trading [00:03:55]. By 1949, Hong Kong's largest companies were banks, land development companies, and trading houses [00:04:02]. Many former industrialists, such as Li Ka-shing, closed their factories to become landlords, seeing it as more profitable [00:04:10]. This led to a significant loss of lower and middle-income manufacturing jobs and a massive doubling down on finance and trading [00:04:32].

## Growth of the Financial Services Sector
Hong Kong's economy shifted from making and exporting goods to serving as a value-added intermediary for investments and cargo between China and the West [00:04:42]. Its British heritage, English language laws, and pro-business attitudes facilitated this role [00:04:57].

The service industry's contribution to Hong Kong's GDP saw substantial growth:
*   **1980:** 68% [00:05:04]
*   **2000:** 86.5% [00:05:10]
*   **2019:** 93.4% [00:05:12]

Construction is the second biggest sector [00:05:17]. Hong Kong Chief Executives, including Tung Chee-hwa and Donald Tsang, did not attempt to reverse the [[deindustrialization_in_hong_kong | deindustrialization]] trend, instead promoting the view that Hong Kong benefits most from the free flow of capital and trade between China and the West [00:05:27].

However, as China reformed and opened up, Hong Kong's intermediary role diminished [00:05:42]. The Pearl River region became a major logistics and transport center [00:05:52], and Shanghai took on many of Hong Kong's service economy functions [00:05:57]. Mainland Chinese cities reformed financial restrictions, allowing foreign capital to flow directly into their ports and logistics networks [00:06:03]. Hong Kong's share of China's trade handling with the rest of the world declined from 60% in 1997 to 28% in 2007, and further to just 10% in 2020 [00:06:11].

With the transport, trade, and logistics sectors declining, the financial services sector became Hong Kong's primary growth engine [00:06:22]. Its contribution to the economy grew:
*   **2000:** Finance, insurance, and real estate contributed 18% of the economy [00:06:30].
*   **2019:** This grew to nearly 30% [00:06:37].

## Challenges and Competition
Even the financial services sector faces increasing competition [00:06:44]. China has been lifting foreign ownership restrictions in its investing and banking markets [00:06:47]. In 2020, foreign banks were allowed complete ownership of their Chinese subsidiaries, followed by securities and fund management firms later that year [00:06:53]. This allows foreign companies to offer financial products and services directly to Chinese consumers [00:07:03]. Major asset managers like BlackRock have taken advantage, launching wholly-owned mutual funds in China, seeing it as a significant opportunity to meet long-term investment goals and address retirement challenges [00:07:09].

Despite the growth of the financial sector, it provides less than 10% of the city's jobs [00:10:02]. The majority of young people in Hong Kong will earn wealth from work, salary, and wages [00:09:56]. Around 85% of Hong Kong's adult population (over 3.1 million people) work for large service-oriented companies such as supermarkets, utilities, and business services [00:10:17]. This domestic landscape is stagnant, dominated by the city's massive land developer business conglomerates [00:10:31]. The anti-competitive nature of established markets makes it difficult for new entrants [00:10:36]. This contributes to significant and growing wage inequality, where bankers and executives earn substantially more than others [00:10:47]. Many service workers are over-educated for their jobs with few career upgrading prospects [00:11:05].

The Hong Kong government has attempted to open new career pathways for youth since 2016 [00:11:37]. They identified emerging industries like cultural and creative (including games and software), medical services, education services, testing and certification, and especially innovation and technology [00:11:44].

## Investment and Asset Financialization
The Hong Kong government encourages investment in wealth-building assets, particularly stock ownership [00:09:27]. Policies encouraging stock ownership have increased participation in the city's stock markets [00:12:43]. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has become a market for Chinese companies like Didi and Alibaba fleeing American capital markets [00:12:50].

However, merely providing stock exchange accounts is not seen as a solution for lower-income individuals seeking wealth or financial stability [00:13:01]. A 2015 survey found that the average Hong Kong retail stock investor was 47 years old and already earned substantially more than the average household income [00:13:08]. Stocks are often a means to "stay rich," rather than "get rich" [00:13:20].

Hong Kong stocks have shown lagging performance compared to international benchmarks:
*   **Hong Kong 2550 Index Fund (past 10 years):** 8.2% annually [00:13:32]
*   **Hang Seng Index Fund (past 5 years):** 3.56% total return [00:13:40]
*   **S&P 500 (past 5 years):** 16.6% annually [00:13:47]

The underperformance is attributed to factors like regulatory issues affecting major Chinese companies such as Meituan, Alibaba, and Tencent [00:13:54]. Many of Hong Kong's listed companies operate and make money within the city [00:14:04]. For these companies to become more shareholder-friendly and raise stock prices, actions like mass layoffs and moving low-skilled workers into non-standard employment may be necessary, contributing to income insecurity [00:14:10].

Given that [[housing_and_land_issues_in_hong_kong | Hong Kong real estate]] has become too expensive for the average citizen to invest in directly [00:14:30], the government and financial sector have sought new assets to package into investment vehicles [00:14:35]. While these actions have benefited some, they have often come at a long-term detriment to other residents [00:14:45].

Examples of asset financialization include:
*   **MTR Privatization:** In 2000, the Hong Kong government partially privatized the Hong Kong MTR, the railway company also known as a land developer [00:14:56]. After privatization, MTR stopped receiving free land grants for railway extensions and focused on profitable land management, with profits from land development declining significantly (from HKD 8.3 billion in 2007 to HKD 530 million in 2016) [00:15:08]. The company expanded its landlord services to include advertising and telecom [00:15:31]. While no longer a financial burden on the government, a mass transit company focused on monetizing existing networks rather than expanding them is seen as a long-term failure [00:15:41].
*   **The Link REIT:** The government sold the car parking and retail facilities of its public housing complexes to a real estate investment trust called The Link [00:15:56]. The purpose was ostensibly to raise funds for the housing authority, and The Link was IPO'd to the markets [00:16:04]. Tenants criticized this move, arguing the facilities were sold for too little and that it would negatively affect shop owners' livelihoods [00:16:10]. The IPO, subscribed by retail investors, valued The Link at up to five times its initial price [00:16:23]. Subsequently, The Link raised rents, driving many tenants into economic hardship [00:16:28].

## Consequences
While Hong Kong's choice to [[deindustrialization_in_hong_kong | demanufacture]] its economy and specialize in services and finance has generated significant wealth for many, as evidenced by its higher GDP [00:16:35], it has also created a stark divide [00:16:42]. The economy turned its public goods and even its people into investable assets or cash flow streams [00:17:50]. This has come at a considerable cost to the majority poor, who now see limited pathways to wealth and economic security [00:17:57]. Although Hong Kong remains a desirable place for a privileged few, the opportunity to have developed a sophisticated manufacturing sector, akin to a "Hong Kong TSMC," while maintaining its financial prowess, was missed [00:17:15]. This demonstrates a crucial lesson in economic diversification [00:18:02].

The transition to copper and low-K dielectric interconnects in semiconductor manufacturing saw different companies adopt varied strategies, leading to shifts in industry leadership and technological approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## IBM's Pioneering Approach
IBM was a pioneer in developing copper interconnects, working on the problem for 15 years in a secret project code-named "red aluminium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. They announced their successful production of copper interconnects in September 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Their strategy involved developing key technologies such as the use of tantalum as a diffusion barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, the damascene method around 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, and the "super-filling" or "bottoms-up growth" electroplating technique from 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.

For low-K dielectrics at the 130 nanometer node, IBM made a bold technological choice to adopt Dow Chemical's proprietary SiLK material, applied with the spin-on technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. This choice, however, ultimately failed in production, as IBM failed to ship products with SiLK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>. They eventually switched to Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:24">[00:33:24]</a>.

## TSMC's "Go-It-Alone" Strategy
The Asian foundries, including [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]], initially lagged behind American companies in copper development, not seriously considering it until 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>. For the copper transition, [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]] decided to "go it alone," with a team of six elite semiconductor scientists leading a crash effort to develop their own copper interconnect implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

For low-K dielectrics, [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]] experienced significant [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenges]] with the spin-on Hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) technique at the 180 nanometer node, causing delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. For the 130 nanometer node, [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]] adopted the Black Diamond material from Applied Materials, which was compatible with CVD, explicitly due to their prior negative experience with spin-on techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a>. [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]] was the first to ship 130 nanometer chips with both copper interconnects and low-K dielectric in October 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:07">[00:32:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.

## UMC's Collaborative Approach
UMC, another major Taiwanese foundry, was rapidly catching up to [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]] in market share and capacity by the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. For copper interconnects, UMC opted for a collaborative strategy, joining an IBM-sponsored research consortium to collectively research copper interconnects and benefit from IBM's patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

For low-K dielectrics, UMC partnered with IBM and Infineon, adopting Dow Chemical's SiLK material and the spin-on technique for their 130 nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. This proved to be a costly bad choice, as UMC's customers also failed to ship products with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. UMC signaled defeat in October 2001, defecting from IBM and dropping SiLK for a CVD process from Novellus Systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>.

## Intel's Conservative Stance
Intel did not start their copper interconnect program until 1997, despite their own researchers publishing on copper electroplating in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. Intel's 180 nanometer process did not use copper interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. This was due to being late to copper and their need for a process that could scale rapidly to massive quantities for their PC CPU monopoly, requiring sufficient copper tools from suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:10">[00:23:10]</a>.

Intel only implemented copper interconnects in November 2000 with the 130 nanometer node, and even then, only six of the seven layers were made from copper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. For low-K dielectrics, Intel apparently chose to stick with the older, second-generation Fluorinated Silicon Glass (FSG) technique, again because of their larger capacity needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:44">[00:31:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:47">[00:31:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.

## Other Companies' Strategies
*   **Motorola**
    Motorola announced they had produced copper interconnects just two weeks after IBM's announcement in October 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. They started their copper work in 1990, having gained insight through their alliance with IBM for the PowerPC chip, inferring IBM's copper breakthroughs through design rule changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. Motorola released a 220 nanometer node in late 1998, with the first chips being PowerPC G4 chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

*   **AMD**
    AMD started their copper work around 1995, ramping up quickly despite being initially slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

*   **AT&T - Bell Labs**
    AT&T (Bell Labs) also began their copper work around the same time as AMD, and notably developed their entire copper interconnect stack separately from IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

*   **Texas Instruments**
    Texas Instruments suffered through similar low-K dielectric [[challenges_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenges]] as [[comparison_to_global_semiconductor_leaders | TSMC]] with the HSQ spin-on technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:24">[00:29:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. For the 130 nanometer node, TI favored a different low-K dielectric material called "Black Diamond" from Applied Materials, which was exclusive to CVD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.

The competitive landscape of the semiconductor manufacturing industry at the time meant that many players had their own variants of each technology generation, allowing them to pick and choose which aspects of the specifications to adopt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. The collective research facilitated by organizations like Sematech also contributed to the rapid catch-up in copper technology across the industry, despite individual company efforts to maintain secrecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

Recent online discussions, particularly on Hacker News, have revealed a negative perception of career paths in [[Challenges in semiconductor manufacturing | semiconductor manufacturing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Comments suggest that these roles are seen as problematic, characterized by long hours, subpar labor practices, and low pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Some descriptions paint a picture of demanding work environments, likening a "fab person" job to constantly being on call, often getting woken up, and being responsible for tools even when not on call, alongside facing abusive and pathological behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The long-term career prospects for a TSMC engineer, for instance, were summarized as "sucking," requiring PhDs, post-doctorate experience, and over 10 years in an R&D "sweatshop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Despite American politicians' and elites' push to build fabs for semiconductor independence and staff them with industry talents, there's a challenge in attracting Americans to the field if peers actively discourage entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## [[Differences between manufacturing and nonmanufacturing semiconductor jobs | Differences between Manufacturing and Non-Manufacturing Jobs]]

The semiconductor industry broadly consists of manufacturing and design jobs, which typically require different skill sets and offer distinct work environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

*   **Design Jobs**: These roles focus on creating the designs that foundries fabricate into actual chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Companies like TSMC hire IC design engineers to work with customers on chip fabrication preparation, and also employ software developers, including AI engineers, to develop algorithms for machine performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. These non-manufacturing positions are often compared to software engineering, involving comfortable office work (or remote work) and high pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Jobs**: These roles involve direct work in fabs, often requiring clean suits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The goal of [[Challenges in semiconductor manufacturing | semiconductor manufacturing]] is to deliver complex products at a staggering scale, demanding significant operational discipline and military-style execution from companies like Intel, Samsung, and TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Manufacturing Job Roles and Demands (Taiwanese Context)

In Taiwan, [[Challenges in semiconductor manufacturing | manufacturing lines]] typically have two types of workers:

*   **Line Technicians and Operators**: Led by a foreman, their responsibilities include debugging manufacturing issues, operating the line, and inspecting products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. These roles typically require only a high school or vocational degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. They often work 12-hour shifts, two days on and two days off, from 7 AM to 7 PM or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. While the pay is better than working at a convenience store, the anxiety and high pressure, especially for a foreman at TSMC, are significantly higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The internal job progression is somewhat limited, usually only reaching foreman status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Engineers**: Engineers collaborate with technicians to guide manufacturing process flow and resolve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. TSMC employs several categories:
    *   **Process Engineers**: They inspect and analyze processes, optimizing variables and conducting tests when yield rates are low, leading to a difficult work life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
    *   **Equipment Engineers**: They monitor and inspect equipment, taking responsibility when it breaks down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. A technical degree is required, but not always in electrical engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. In Taiwan, they might even visit temples and buy charms in hopes of making devices more obedient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
    *   **R&D Engineers**: Involved in new product development, these roles face high pressure and a race against time and competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. They regularly require PhDs and work over 10 hours a day on experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Success in these roles brings recognition and significant impact within the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   **Production Management Engineers**: These engineers handle production forecasting and logistics, ensuring proper product dispatch, sufficient resources for smooth production, and customer awareness of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Strong English skills are often required due to interaction with Western customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
    *   **Smart Manufacturing and AI Engineers**: These roles use big data and AI techniques to enhance production efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## [[Challenges in the semiconductor industry | Workforce Challenges and Perceptions]]

[[Challenges in the semiconductor industry | Semiconductor foundries]] face difficulty filling these positions, particularly in the United States, due to the attractive compensation offered by the software development industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Software development is perceived as a superior job category globally, offering easy entry, numerous companies, legendary perks, and exceptionally high salaries (including stock compensation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This is exemplified by the fact that 9 out of 10 Berkeley EECS majors graduating in 2018 entered software engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Even within the semiconductor field, many opt for chip design, which shares similarities with software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Most highly educated individuals prefer working remotely and writing code over wearing a clean suit and working in a factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

This problem is intercontinental:
*   **China**: China also struggles to hire and retain experienced line technicians, as their youngest and brightest workers prefer becoming software developers for tech giants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Taiwan**: Even in Taiwan, where society heavily pushes young people into electrical engineering and TSMC is revered, the company experiences substantial turnover among technicians and engineers due to the demanding work culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. The expansion of TSMC into Arizona has highlighted these culture clashes for American employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The growing presence of chip design companies in Taiwan, offering competitive salaries, makes it easier for talent to leave manufacturing roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## [[Strategies for addressing workforce shortages in semiconductor industry | Addressing Workforce Shortages]]

Companies are taking steps to mitigate these [[Challenges in the semiconductor industry | challenges]]:
*   **TSMC**: The company increased employee wages by 20% in 2020 (effective 2022) and is working to make it easier for employees to purchase company stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. More pay, while not solving the work environment issue, certainly helps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Intel**: Intel has successfully built its own pipelines of semiconductor specialist technicians by partnering with Arizona community colleges for two-year technical education programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. In Malaysia, Intel offered research grants for students to learn semiconductor engineering (especially packaging) and contributed senior engineers' time to train them in industry practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This approach aims to create a trained, affordable workforce tailored to the company's needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

However, a downside is that these workers can develop highly specialized skills, making it difficult to leave the field, potentially leading to underpayment or poor treatment due to the limited number of companies involved in advanced [[Challenges in semiconductor manufacturing | semiconductor manufacturing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. In contrast, software engineers and IC chip designers have a much larger pool of potential employers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

## Policy Solutions and the Immigration Debate

Ideas to address the economically undervalued but strategically important nature of semiconductor skills include individual income credits for hardware technicians or extra taxes for software engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

Immigration is another proposed solution, suggesting bringing foreign semiconductor talents to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The recently passed CHIPS Act is expected to create about eight new fabs, translating to approximately 27,000 new jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. A report indicates that at least 3,500 of these jobs will need to be filled by highly skilled foreign workers with prior expertise, ideally from firms like TSMC or Samsung, to transfer tacit engineering knowledge to American workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. While high-level executives and R&D personnel can already immigrate (many educated in the US and some holding dual citizenship), the need for 3,500 engineers and technicians might not be considered a severe enough shortage to warrant a special immigration program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. A historical comparison is the H-1A visa program in the 1980s for nursing shortages, which issued nearly 40,000 visas over six years before sunsetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Given the current political environment, such a program is unlikely to be repeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Furthermore, immigration doesn't address the fundamental issue of Americans preferring software over hardware careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

## Lack of Hardware Interaction Among Youth

A contributing factor to the disinterest in semiconductor careers among young Americans is their limited access to and interaction with hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. In contrast, access to software is easy, allowing young people to spark an interest that can lead to a career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. While "right to repair" laws play a role, the inherent complexity of modern hardware is a significant barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. In the 1960s, an average person could open and understand a transistor radio; personal computers, while more complex, still allowed direct interaction with hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Today's cell phones are too complex, built with technology stacks that a single person could spend a lifetime studying, often limiting user interaction to just changing the battery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. As a result, users interact daily with graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and user experiences (UX) software, leading them to careers in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. The integrated chip, despite its beauty, remains unseen and untinkered with by young people, leading them to grow up without considering it as a career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

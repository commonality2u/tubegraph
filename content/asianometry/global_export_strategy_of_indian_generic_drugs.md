The Indian economy is largely service-based, with pharmaceuticals being a significant exception where manufacturing plays a crucial role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. India's pharmaceutical industry was the third largest by volume and 11th largest by value as of 2020, experiencing rapid [[growth_of_indias_pharmaceutical_industry | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It is the world's largest provider of generic drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, with the United States relying on India for 40% of its generics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. In 2020, India exported $16 billion more in pharmaceuticals than it imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. These exports meet the strict standards and regulations of many countries worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Genesis of the Industry: The Patent Act of 1970

Following India's independence in 1947, millions of Indians lacked access to basic drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The country's drug industry was nearly entirely controlled by foreign multinational corporations, with eight of the top ten firms being Western companies (primarily from the UK, France, and Germany) holding a 90% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Domestic Indian companies focused on marketing and distributing foreign drugs rather than creating their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, leading to almost all drugs being imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Drug prices were among the highest globally, as 99% of drugs were protected by patents, limiting access to only the wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

To address this reliance on foreign drug imports, the Indian government took several steps:
*   In 1954, Hindustan Antibiotics Limited (HAL), a public sector pharmaceutical firm, was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   A few years later, Indian Drugs and Pharmaceuticals Limited was founded in cooperation with the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   The turning point arrived when Indian company Cipla began manufacturing a generic version of propranolol, a high blood pressure medication developed by British pharmaceutical company ICI Pharmaceuticals, which was too expensive for India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Cipla's R&D head, Yusuf Hamied, justified his actions to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who then urged parliament to modify drug patent laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

This led to the passing of the [[impact_of_the_patent_act_of_1970_on_drug_accessibility | Patent Act of 1970]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, which aimed to guarantee low-cost access to drugs and foster an indigenous Indian pharmaceutical industry through import substitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The 1970 Act replaced product patents (which protected chemical compounds) with a system that protected the *process* of making a drug, not the product itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. It also set shorter time limits on these process patents (5-7 years) compared to the old law's 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. The Indian Patent Office could also force patent holders to license patents at a reasonable rate if they were not being used in a socially beneficial way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

This new system allowed Indian companies to reverse engineer popular drug imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The number of pharmaceutical firms in India more than doubled between 1970 and 1980 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Companies would reproduce and optimize existing drugs by making slight modifications to the manufacturing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This strategy, though seemingly derivative, helped domestic companies gain significant competency in pharmaceuticals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. By the end of the 1980s, Indian companies could manufacture virtually any new molecule without needing the original innovator's recipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The time gap between the introduction of original innovations and Indian generics steadily narrowed, demonstrating improving reverse engineering capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. For example, Ibuprofen took six years for an Indian generic (1967 vs. 1973), while Ciprofloxacin took only three years (1986 vs. 1989) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. By 2006, Indian companies supplied 95% of the country's drugs, signifying successful import substitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Shifts Post-TRIPS Agreement

Despite its successes in drug accessibility, the 1970 Patent Act had drawbacks. The industry it created was high in volume but low in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. With low barriers to entry and little capital needed, there were around 16,000 pharmaceutical companies by 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Companies focused on making as many molecules as cheaply as possible, resulting in extremely low margins and vast overcapacity, leading to a highly fragmented industry with up to 100 brands for a single molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The domestic Indian pharmaceutical industry did not invest meaningful amounts in R&D and produced few new drugs due to a lack of resources, incentives, or protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. While some companies turned to the export market, by the 1990s, 40% of Indian drug production was for export, but these were still low-value products, locking Indian companies out of more lucrative markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

A major milestone in the industry's history was India's signing of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This agreement, controversial at the time, required India to amend its patent policies to conform to international trade standards, including recognizing product patents and granting exclusive marketing rights to new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The international trade community gave India until 2005 to prepare its drug industry, leading to a gradual implementation of changes like the exclusive marketing rights amendment in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

Between 1992 and 2005, the industry underwent a monumental shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>:
*   **Limited Drug Discovery R&D**: A few firms, such as Ranbaxy, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (DRL), and Wockhardt, decided to invest in R&D and enter the drug discovery business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. From 1956-1987, the industry discovered only 13 new drug compounds, but from 1991-2005, that number was seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Annual R&D spending accelerated from 4.9% before 1992 to 6.6% after 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Indian institutions saw pharmaceutical drug patents grow significantly: from 9 in 1990-1994 to 48 in 1995-1998, and further to 227 in 1999-2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The government supported R&D with schemes, government bodies, and a pharmaceutical R&D support fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. However, drug discovery remained expensive and rare for most small to medium-sized Indian firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.
*   **Diversification and Strengthening**: Many companies sought other ways to strengthen or diversify revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Some invested in R&D for drug-adjacent fields like drug delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, while others expanded and strengthened areas like marketing and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **Strategic Collaborations**: Companies like Zydus Cadila struck collaboration deals with multinationals in France, Cuba, Switzerland, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Biocon, a biopharmaceutical company, also signed deals with large companies like Novartis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Their joint venture with the Cuban Center of Molecular Immunology helped Biocon develop the first new monoclonal antibody treatment by an Indian pharmaceutical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Mergers and Acquisitions**: Other firms decided to scale up through mergers and acquisitions with companies operating in different parts of the value chain to match the size of Western multinationals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

These different paths shared a common goal: surviving a new, more challenging business environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

## Global Export Dominance

The TRIPS agreement significantly pushed India's pharmaceutical companies towards the export market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Once the industry met its IP regulation responsibilities, the global market opened up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Today, India's generics industry is highly internationally competitive, aided by lower costs and expertise honed from competing in the brutal domestic market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. A favorable generic drug regulatory environment, such as the U.S. Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 which allowed the FDA to more easily approve generic drugs, also helped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

Examples of export growth include:
*   Dr. Reddy's Laboratories increased the export ratio of their overall revenue from 53% (2000-2005) to 74% (2012-2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   Marksons Pharma went from 21.2% (2000-2005) to 97.5% (2012-2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   The entire industry's export intensity grew at an average rate of about 13% in the years after the 2005 implementation of TRIPS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

The industry is nearly eight times the size it was then, with sales to North America, Africa, and Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Outlook

A significant concern for India's export success is the [[indias_dependency_on_china_for_active_pharmaceutical_ingredients | industry's concurrent dependency on China for its active pharmaceutical ingredients]] (APIs), which are the most important raw materials for finished drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. India relies on China for 70% of its APIs, and imports of Chinese APIs, particularly antibiotics, have tripled since 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. India used to produce these domestically but lost the market in the 1990s when Chinese products were 40% cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. Even with higher Chinese labor costs today, the price gap remains about 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. This industrial weakness became pronounced in 2020 when China's lockdowns led to stock shortages and restricted exports of certain ingredients for virus medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Geopolitical tensions between China and India further emphasize the need for the Indian industry and government to work together to close these shortcomings with new import substitution policies for APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

Despite these concerns, India's pharmaceutical success has been noted by other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. Ironically, as India moved away from process-based patents, other countries began to move towards them, seeing how the 1970 Indian Patent Act helped lower drug costs and break the hold of multinationals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. The Indian pharmaceutical industry's current position is a testament to the removal and re-application of IP rights, serving as a perfect example of market-driven reform sparked by environmental changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. India's flexible approach, adapting based on what was right for them at the time, rather than adhering to rigid ideology, has been key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. India's pharmaceutical industry is poised to play a huge role in addressing the world's health issues in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

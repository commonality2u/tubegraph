National Steel Corporation (NSC) was once a significant entity in the Philippine industry, recognized as one of the country's largest companies and a rare example of a well-managed government-owned enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Over two decades, it employed over 4,000 workers in Iligan City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The Philippines had an early lead among Asian countries in developing a steel industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While NSC had the potential to become a global player, various factors ultimately led to its decline and failure by 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Post-War Economic Context and Industrial Ambitions

Following World War II, the Philippine economy was primarily agricultural and semi-colonial, with significant foreign dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Unlike neighbors like Indonesia and Malaysia, the Philippines lacked petroleum reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, but it possessed abundant metallic minerals such as iron, copper, gold, and nickel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

President Carlos Garcia initiated an industrialization drive to boost economic output and enrich the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The government viewed these minerals as foundational to a highly industrialized future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. A key issue was the country's lack of adequate steel facilities, forcing it to export iron ore to Japan only to reimport finished steel products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Establishing domestic steel and rolling mills would enable the Philippines to build its own ships, roads, and electric power infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Furthermore, a thriving steel industry would open doors to specialty alloys and industrial chemicals like sulfuric acid, soda ash, and fertilizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Thus, the country needed its own [[importance_of_integrated_steel_mills_for_industrialization|integrated steel mill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Understanding Steel Production Methods

The steel industry primarily uses two methods for production:

1.  **Integrated Steel Mill Process** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>: This vertically integrated process refines iron ore into steel through four main steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>:
    *   **Sintering:** Heating fine iron ore with coal and other materials to create sinter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   **Pig Iron Production:** Creating pig iron, a high-carbon intermediary product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
    *   **Steel Production:** Placing pig iron in a blast furnace with fuel and oxygen to produce steel. Modern steelmaking includes a secondary step to remove dissolved gases and add alloys for higher quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   **Finishing:** Transforming semi-finished steel into bars, sheets, wires, and tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    These steps are typically performed within a single facility, an [[importance_of_integrated_steel_mills_for_industrialization|integrated steel mill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

2.  **Mini Mills (Scrap Metal)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>: This newer method starts with scrap metal instead of iron ore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Mini steel plants use electricity to generate intense heat, melting down scrap metal, cleaning impurities, and recasting it into new steel products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This method is cheaper due to fewer steps, but the resulting steel was initially considered inferior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Early mini mills in the 1950s and 60s focused on low-margin rebar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. However, mini mills improved throughout the 1970s, disrupting the market and eroding the margins of traditional [[importance_of_integrated_steel_mills_for_industrialization|integrated steel mills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This business disruption example was popularized by Clayton Christensen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## From NASCO to IISMI: Early Struggles

In 1950, the Philippine government established the National Shipyard and Steel Corporation (NASCO) in Iligan City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Its steel mill converted scrap metal into ingots, bars, steel shapes, and rods, primarily for ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. The strategy was to combine steel and shipbuilding to foster domestic ship construction and gain export experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

In 1955, NASCO received 50 million pesos to set up pig iron plants, which would transform it into an [[importance_of_integrated_steel_mills_for_industrialization|integrated steel mill]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. If completed, NASCO would have been Asia's second such facility, with only the Japanese preceding it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

A currency crisis soon impacted NASCO's plans, making it difficult to purchase steel-making equipment from abroad without foreign currency, necessitating loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. In 1958, President Garcia, while promoting a "Filipino First" policy, secured a $62.4 million loan from the United States Export-Import (Exim) Bank during a visit to the U.S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The loan came with two conditions: the money had to be spent solely on American steel-making equipment, and NASCO had to be privatized, with 49% of shares sold to a private investor, though the government could retain 51% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This privatization was reportedly insisted upon by the Exim Bank due to past bureaucratic inefficiencies or, as some accounts suggest, by American steel companies seeking protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

This led to the formation of Iligan Integrated Steel Mills (IISMI), a joint venture, with Jacinto Steel winning the bid as the private investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. By 1962, the Jacintos had acquired the entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

The privatization process faced significant delays, causing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The Jacintos informed the government that the initial $62 million was insufficient to build a full [[importance_of_integrated_steel_mills_for_industrialization|integrated steel mill]], only enough for a cold and hot rolling mill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The government guaranteed the Exim Bank loan and the Bank of the Philippines lent IISMI an additional 30 million pesos to complete the mill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

IISMI struggled to turn a profit throughout its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Conflicting reasons for this include:
*   The Jacintos allegedly used IISMI to cross-subsidize other family business ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   The government failed to adequately protect the company, allowing it to face domestic competition and providing far less support than steel companies in other Asian countries, such as Japan's government, which offered raw goods subsidies, import bans, and substantial tax incentives to its six domestic steel companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

The cold and hot rolling mill was completed between 1967 and 1969 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. IISMI sought another $70 million loan to finish the blast furnace by 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. However, the 1970s brought global oil price shocks and economic turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. In 1970, the peso devalued significantly, raising the cost of imported goods and making it difficult for indebted industrialists to service foreign currency debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Assistance from the government depended on industrialists' standing with President Ferdinand Marcos, who did not favor the Jacinto family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Consequently, the Development Bank of the Philippines foreclosed on IISMI's loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

After martial law was declared in 1972, the military seized IISMI's assets and transferred them to National Steel Corporation (NSC), a subsidiary of the Development Bank, a process completed in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## The Rise of National Steel Corporation (NSC)

The government created NSC to stabilize the industry, preserve thousands of jobs, and protect creditors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Initially, NSC focused on survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. To prevent game-ending loan losses for banks, NSC merged with several other bankrupt local steel factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This expanded its capacity from 141,000 tons in 1974 to 452,000 tons by 1979 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

By 1979, NSC exited survival mode, becoming the country's 11th largest corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. NSC was the Philippines' leading producer of billets, tin plates, and flat rolled steel, holding a monopoly over the domestic steel industry for the next two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Its specialty was flat steel products, which it excelled at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. NSC's steel goods were exported to China, Indonesia, and the United States, where they were preferred over domestic competitors despite shipping costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

NSC was a significant patron of Iligan City, providing up to 75% of the city's total revenues during the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The company offered extensive health care and housing benefits to its 4,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The lowest basic salary was 10,000 pesos a month, substantially higher than the average hourly wage of 9 to 20 pesos at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Employees also received 10-15% annual salary increases, mid-year bonuses, year-end bonuses, and sick leave monetization benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. NSC employees were considered "steel towners," part of a high-class village, known for their appearance and lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Despite the economic turmoil of the 1980s, the company experienced only one strike in 22 years, and employee turnover was below one percent, reflecting the pride in being an NSC worker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Challenges and Privatization

The 1980s saw trade reforms that reduced steel product tariffs to three percent, leading to an influx of cheap imports from Taiwan and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Despite this, NSC remained profitable, weathering the challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. In 1983, the company invested 27 billion pesos in system computerization and other upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, recognizing a decline in the market for its core flat steel products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

Entering the 1990s, NSC continued to turn a profit, such as 538 million pesos in 1991, but the trend was downward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. The flat steel market was increasingly dominated by cheaper South Korean and Taiwanese imports, necessitating upgrades, with many companies moving into coils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

Company management understood the need for more investment to stay competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Crucially, NSC still lacked full vertical integration; it did not have iron and steel-making capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The company needed capital for these facilities, but the government, overexposed to numerous state-owned corporations, had no funds to spare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. President Fidel Ramos openly stated that the government was not meant to run a steel company, prompting a search for a private investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

In 1993, a majority share in NSC was auctioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. The successful bidder was required to continue and complete NSC's business plans and maintain its global competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## The Fall: Incompetent Management and Financial Crisis

The winner of the auction was Wintek Holdings, a Malaysian company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The transaction was finalized in 1995, a year many NSC employees consider the end of their era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. A critical problem was that Wintek, while from the steel industry, comprised foreign steel traders, not steel makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Top management lacked operational knowledge, a fact the Philippine government (still holding a 12.5% share) should have recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

Signs of mismanagement under Wintek included:
*   The CEO did not relocate to the Philippines, commuting from Kuala Lumpur at great expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   Planning and update meetings ceased, eroding employee trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   Suppliers were switched to Wintek's own trading corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   In late 1995, the new management ordered a massive quantity of raw steel goods at peak prices, leading to significant financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   Financial disclosures to banks were restricted, creating opportunities for fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

Losses escalated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. In 1995, NSC laid off employees for the first time since 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Despite 1996 being one of the best economic years for the Philippines, NSC recorded an unprecedented loss of 2 billion pesos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

In early 1997, Wintek sold NSC to another Malaysian trading firm, Hautic Investment Limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Hautic was highly leveraged, borrowing around $800 million USD for the acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. The onset of the [[impact_of_global_competition_on_the_philippine_steel_industry|Asian Financial Crisis of 1997]] proved disastrous for their plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Another Malaysian management team, equally inexperienced, took over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Planned upgrades never materialized, and previous upgrades suffered from neglect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Meanwhile, cheap imported products continued to flood the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

The crisis caused another massive devaluation of the peso, making NSC's U.S. dollar-denominated loans and raw materials prohibitively expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Creditors and suppliers severed ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Employee early retirement buyouts further strained finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. After a failed intervention by the city, NSC ceased operations in November 1999, resulting in 1,800 employees losing their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. City revenues dropped by 72 million pesos that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## Failed Revival Attempts and Legacy

In 2004, an Indian group formed Global Steel Philippines Inc. (GSPI) to acquire NSC's assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. These assets, though dormant for five years, still held some value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. It was later revealed that the Indian investors were linked to Mittal Steel (now ArcelorMittal), then the world's second-largest steel company, suggesting legitimate experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

Despite this, GSPI failed to take off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. While it produced and shipped some flat steel, it operated far below capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. A chronic lack of funds, unsuccessful attempts to secure additional national government support, and an adversarial relationship with the local community and government led to another closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

NSC's decline had widespread repercussions across Iligan City and its supporting industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. Losses to supporting businesses were estimated at 1.4 billion pesos annually, with local scrap metal collectors, service contractors, and the power utility suffering the most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. While cheap imports contributed to the decline of NSC's core markets, the company was still profitable into 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Ultimately, its downfall was attributed to incompetent management and an unprecedented financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

Proposals for NSC's revival occasionally surface, but none have succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. Today, the 145-hectare plant and its adjacent 600-unit housing complex in Iligan City sit largely unused, most recently serving as a quarantine center – a stark reminder of what could have been <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

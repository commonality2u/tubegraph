Concerns have been raised in Taiwan about whether America is attempting to "steal" TSMC, particularly with the company's new facility in Arizona beginning operations in 2024 and recent local elections in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This notion often stems from anxieties about TSMC's expanding global footprint and its potential [[impact_of_export_bans_and_political_influence_on_chinese_semiconductor_industry | impact on the Taiwanese economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## TSMC's Global Expansion and Taiwanese Concerns

TSMC first announced its Arizona production facility in May 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Initially, there were questions about whether this would mirror the Foxconn in Wisconsin scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The Arizona facility was planned to produce N5 chips, which are very advanced, representing the most advanced node TSMC had ever tried to bring outside of Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Taiwanese observers initially found comfort in two aspects of the Arizona plan:
*   **Small Scale**: The Arizona site was relatively small, projected to produce about 20,000 300-millimeter wafers a month, compared to Taiwan's four gigafabs, which collectively produce over 100,000 such wafers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Technological Lag**: N5 would not be the leading edge by the time the factory came online, with the presumption that N3 would be active by 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

However, new announcements before its December 2022 tool-in ceremony expanded TSMC's U.S. commitment:
*   **N4 Process**: TSMC will bring its N4 process, an upgrade to the N5 line, to Arizona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Second Arizona Fab**: An additional investment of $28 billion over three years to open a second Arizona factory equipped with N3 technology, expected for high-volume production by 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Despite these expansions, TSMC remains committed to keeping its most advanced nodes in Taiwan, with plans for N2 and N1 fabs in Taiwan, the former expected by 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. TSMC is also expanding into other countries, including a specialty N28 plant in Japan and ongoing discussions for a plant in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. These moves deviate from TSMC's historical norm of concentrating its most advanced operations in Taiwan, causing nervousness in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Driving Factors for Expansion

TSMC's expansion is driven by a confluence of demand and financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. As a commercial entity, TSMC works closely with its customers, notably Apple, which accounts for about 25% of its total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Apple has stated its intention to source from plants in Arizona starting 2024, and potentially Europe as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. TSMC aims to avoid losing customers like Apple to competitors such as Samsung and Intel, both of whom are building massive new facilities in the United States, partly supported by [[government_subsidies_and_investments_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | government subsidies]] from the CHIPS Act of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Scale of Investment and Production: Taiwan Remains Core

Despite overseas ventures, the claim that America is "stealing" Taiwan's manufacturing or causing "massive loss" to the Taiwanese economy is not supported by current data on scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Capital Expenditure
TSMC's projected capital expenditure for 2022 was $36 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The $28 billion investment in the second Arizona fab, spread over three years until 2026, averages about $9 billion per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. This represents approximately 25% to 30% of the proposed annual capital expenditure, meaning the majority of TSMC's spending will still be in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Wafer Shipments
In 2021, TSMC produced and shipped 14.2 million 300-millimeter equivalent wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The Arizona factory, when it starts production in 2024, will produce around 20,000 300-millimeter equivalent wafers a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This is less than 1/50th of current annual production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Even with the planned expansion to 50,000 wafers a month by 2026, it will still not be a significant portion of TSMC's total output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

TSMC is simultaneously juggling at least five other build-outs and expansions in Taiwan, including:
*   New phases for existing Taiwanese fabs, such as expansions in Tainan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   New N2 plants in Baoshan and potentially Taichung <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   Future plans for an N1 plant in the Longtan District <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   An N28 build in Kaohsiung, with construction officially beginning in November 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

This demonstrates that the majority of TSMC's investment and production capacity will continue to be based in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Taiwan's Broader Semiconductor Ecosystem

Even if America were to increase its domestic chip manufacturing, it would not achieve self-sufficiency in silicon due to several factors related to Taiwan's deep involvement in the global supply chain:

### Focus on Leading-Edge vs. Mature Nodes
The Arizona fab will produce advanced N4 and N3 chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. However, the majority of the world's industrially important semiconductors (e.g., for fridges, airplanes, cars) are not leading-edge chips; they are mature nodes like 130nm, 65nm, and N28 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. These chips represent the majority of TSMC's volume, though a minority of its revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Other Taiwanese Foundries
Beyond TSMC, Taiwan is home to other significant semiconductor foundries such as UMC (third largest), Powerchip (seventh), and Vanguard (eighth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. These companies possess specialty processes that few others have, contributing to Taiwan's unique position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Packaging, Assembly, and Testing (OSAT)
Taiwan holds leading positions in the rest of the chip supply chain, including wafers, packaging, assembly, and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. America's position in global packaging, assembly, and test capacity is notably worse than its fabrication market share (3% versus 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Taiwan hosts three of the world's five largest outsourced semiconductor packaging, assembly, and testing companies: ASE Group (the largest), SPIL, and Powertech Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Duplicating this entire global supply chain would be immensely expensive, if not economically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### Human Capital and Industrial Development
The managers running the fabs, including C-suite personnel and thousands of hard-to-replace individuals in R&D, operations, and supply chain management, are primarily based in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Billions of dollars and some 50 years of industrial development have made Taiwan a leader not only in semiconductor manufacturing but also in other areas like electronics assembly and specialty plastics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This established ecosystem cannot be replaced in a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

## Conclusion

Taiwan remains TSMC's greatest asset, and TSMC has no choice but to remain heavily invested in Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The notion of America "stealing" TSMC from Taiwan is an oversimplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The status quo, with Taiwan as the central hub of the global semiconductor industry, has benefited many, and its continuation is hoped for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

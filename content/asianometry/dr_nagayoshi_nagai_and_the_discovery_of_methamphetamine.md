Dr. Nagayoshi Nagai, a pioneering Japanese scientist, was responsible for the discovery and synthesis of methamphetamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Early Life and Training Abroad

Nagai was among the first Japanese scientists to pursue training abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. In 1871, he traveled to Berlin, Germany, where he spent 12 years working under the renowned chemist August Wilhelm von Hoffman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. During this period, Nagai conducted experiments on vanilla and cinnamon extracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. His significant discoveries in synthetic vanilla were recognized, leading the Japanese government to request his return to Japan to help establish a pharmaceutical industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Nagai complied, though he briefly returned to Germany later to marry a German woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Research and Synthesis of Methamphetamine

Upon his return to Japan, Dr. Nagai began researching Chinese ephedra, also known as ma Hwang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This shrub grows in the coastal and sub-alpine regions of Mongolia and northeastern China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Traditional Chinese medicine had utilized ma Hwang for at least 5,000 years to treat coughs and fevers, and to induce sweating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

In 1885, Nagai successfully isolated one of the four forms of ephedrine from the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Eight years later, in 1893, he synthesized methamphetamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The original name given to his discovery was "m33n," reflecting its status as Nagai's 33rd extract from the ephedra plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Initial Reception and Subsequent Developments

Initially, few people showed interest in Nagai's synthesis of methamphetamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Decades later, in 1919, Akira Ogata, one of Nagai's students at the University of Tokyo, synthesized a more potent variant known as crystal meth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. At the time, this development also garnered little attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Crystal meth is notable for its ability to easily cross the blood-brain barrier, triggering a rapid release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This chemical cascade results in a rush of energy and euphoria that can last 8 to 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. However, excessive use can lead to hallucinations, delusions, and sleeplessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, while withdrawal symptoms include decreased energy, anxiety, irritability, and disrupted sleep patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Despite its later association with [[japans_postwar_methamphetamine_crisis | Japan's postwar methamphetamine crisis]] and widespread abuse, methamphetamine's initial application in Japan was as a cough suppressant or bronchodilator for asthmatics, and occasionally for treating depression and lethargy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. It was not until World War II that its stimulant effects gained prominence, influenced by the German Army's adoption of pervitin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

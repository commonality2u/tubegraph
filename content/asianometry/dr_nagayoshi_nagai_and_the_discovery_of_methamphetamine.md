Dr. Nagayoshi Nagai, a Japanese scientist, is credited with the discovery of methamphetamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. His work laid the groundwork for the drug that would later become a significant public health concern, particularly during [[japans_postwar_methamphetamine_crisis | Japan's post-war heropan panic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>.

## Early Life and Training
In 1871, Dr. Nagai was one of the first Japanese scientists to train abroad, traveling to Berlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>. He worked there for 12 years under the renowned chemist August Wilhelm von Hoffman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>. During this period, he conducted experiments on vanilla and cinnamon extracts, making notable discoveries in synthetic vanilla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.

## Return to Japan and Pharmaceutical Industry
Following his work in Berlin, the Japanese government asked Dr. Nagai to return to Japan to help establish a pharmaceutical industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>. He did so, though he briefly returned to Germany later to marry a German woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## Research on Chinese Ephedra
In Japan, Dr. Nagai began researching an herb known as Chinese ephedra, or ma Huang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>. This shrub grows in the coastal and sub-alpine regions of Mongolia and northeastern China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>. Chinese traditional medicine had utilized ma Huang for at least 5,000 years to treat coughs and fevers and to induce sweating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:07">[01:29:07]</a>.

In 1885, Nagai successfully isolated one of the four forms of ephedrine from the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>.

## Synthesis of Methamphetamine
Later, in 1893, Dr. Nagai managed to synthesize methamphetamine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. Its original name was M33N, indicating it was Nagai's 33rd extract from the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:57">[01:50:57]</a>. At the time, few people paid attention to this discovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:04">[01:56:04]</a>.

## Akira Ogata and Crystal Meth
Several decades later, in 1919, Akira Ogata, one of Nagai's students at the University of Tokyo, synthesized a more potent variant called crystal meth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:04">[01:59:04]</a>. Again, there was not much public interest at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:05">[02:07:05]</a>.

Crystal meth can easily cross the blood-brain barrier, triggering an "avalanche" of neurotransmitters like dopamine (which induces feelings of well-being), norepinephrine (priming the brain for fight or flight), and, to a lesser extent, serotonin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:01">[02:12:01]</a>. This chemical reaction leads to a rush of energy and euphoria that can last for 8 to 12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:04">[02:32:04]</a>. However, excessive use can result in hallucinations, delusions, and sleeplessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>. Withdrawal symptoms often include decreased energy, anxiety, irritability, and disrupted sleep patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:03">[02:52:03]</a>.

## Initial Uses in Japan
Initially, methamphetamine was used in Japan as a cough suppressant or bronchodilator, helping to relax the muscle bands of asthmatics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:09">[03:12:09]</a>. It was also administered to individuals suffering from depression and lethargic symptoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. However, it was not widely popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:08">[03:24:08]</a>.

## Adoption During World War II
In 1938, during [[role_of_methamphetamine_in_world_war_ii_japan | World War II]], the German Army adopted methamphetamine under the brand name Pervitin for its stimulant effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:01">[03:26:01]</a>. Hearing of this, Japanese researchers like Kenosuke Miura encouraged their government to follow suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:03">[03:34:03]</a>. Miura's company, Dai Nippon Pharmaceutical Company, produced the popular meth brand "Philippon" or "Hedopon," introduced in 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:03">[03:44:03]</a>. The name "loving labor" (from "Philippon") became synonymous with all stimulants for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

In 1941, the government approved the commercial sale of both amphetamine and methamphetamine without limitations, with the more addictive methamphetamine becoming more popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. The drugs were marketed as "Awakening drugs" or "Wakeamines," with advertisements promoting them for night work and other times demanding mental alertness or for overexertion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:03">[04:12:03]</a>.

As [[role_of_methamphetamine_in_world_war_ii_japan | World War II]] progressed, the Japanese military adopted methamphetamine for the war effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. Sentries on nighttime duty received special meth tablets called "cat eye tablets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:05">[04:33:05]</a>. Workers in munitions factories received their own tablets to facilitate working through the night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:07">[04:39:07]</a>. Kamikaze pilots and other special forces took a special meth tablet mixed with green tea powder and stamped with the emperor's crest, known as the "storming tablet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. Methamphetamine was widely used throughout the military, almost always in tablet form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:07">[04:56:07]</a>. Though air pilots reportedly received meth injections under the guise of "nighttime vision hormones" imported from Germany, post-war records suggest these were likely milanotropins extracted from cows and pigs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>. The military stockpiled large quantities of these meth drugs, labeling them a "Mainland decisive battle weapon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.

## Post-War Context
After the war, Japan faced ruinous conditions, chaos, and food shortages, exacerbated by millions of soldiers returning home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:05">[05:29:05]</a>. Many Japanese turned to alcohol and drugs to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. Signs of a meth crisis appeared as early as September 1946, when Tokyo's first meth addict was hospitalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. The crisis was fueled by pharmaceutical companies dumping their wartime supplies into the civilian market, leaked military stockpiles, and informal markets run by crime gangs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. The drugs, often cheaper than alcohol, were easily manufactured in small labs with ingredients from Hong Kong pharmacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. Many soldiers took their pills home, unaware of the hazardous side effects, believing them harmless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

### [[cultural_and_societal_attitudes_towards_meth_in_postwar_japan | Cultural and Societal Attitudes]]
Contemporary documents initially reflected a view of the drug's "positive upsides" for work attitudes and stamina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. The public largely saw methamphetamine as a legitimate aid for productivity, with blame for abuse falling on "immoral people" like entertainers and novelists, rather than the drug itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. However, public perception shifted following two deaths publicly attributed to drug abuse â€“ comedian Miss Wakana in 1946 and novelist Sakonosuke Oda in 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. These widely reported incidents contributed to changing the [[cultural_and_societal_attitudes_towards_meth_in_postwar_japan | country's attitudes towards such drugs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

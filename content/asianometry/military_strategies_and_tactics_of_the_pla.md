On February 17, 1979, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) initiated an attack on the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, beginning with artillery shelling followed by 100,000 troops crossing the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This incursion saw five columns of troops sweeping through border areas and seizing several cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The Chinese leadership viewed this military invasion as the culmination of escalating tensions and perceived "insolence" from Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Background and Strategic Objectives

Historically, China and Vietnam have had a complex and often conflicted relationship, including nearly 1,000 years of colonization and a 20-year invasion by the Ming Dynasty in the 15th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. The Chinese viewed Vietnam as a junior partner and were angered by Hanoi's perceived lack of gratitude for aid provided during the Vietnam War, which came with the condition of not accepting Soviet assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. Rising border clashes and the exodus of ethnic Chinese from Vietnam further fueled tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

Under [[deng_xiaopings_role_and_strategy | Deng Xiaoping]], who emerged as China's paramount leader in July 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) sought to modernize its economy, open to the outside world, and improve relations with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. The Soviet Union was considered China's biggest foreign policy threat at the time, stemming from the long-standing Sino-Soviet Split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Invading Vietnam was seen as a way to demonstrate China's intentions to the global community, proving its forces could competently fight alongside the West against Soviet influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. [[deng_xiaopings_role_and_strategy | Deng Xiaoping]] personally drove the war effort, seemingly harboring a grudge against the Vietnamese <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

## PLA Strategy and Execution

[[deng_xiaopings_role_and_strategy | Deng Xiaoping]] specifically instructed the PLA to limit the war's scope to achieve China's political goals, aiming to avoid getting bogged down like the U.S. in Vietnam and to keep the Soviet Union from intervening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

The war was planned in two stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>:
*   **Stage One (February 17-25)**: A two-pronged offensive striking Cao Bang, Lao Cai, and Dong Dang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
*   **Stage Two (February 26-March 5)**: PLA forces would converge on Lang Son <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

After these stages, the Chinese army would withdraw and claim victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. Approximately 330,000 PLA men were allocated for the land-based attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. Ahead of the invasion, China evacuated 300,000 civilians from Soviet border zones to guard against a Soviet counterattack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.

### Initial Miscalculations
The Vietnamese high command was reportedly baffled by the PLA's attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. Vietnam's regular troops were largely deployed in Cambodia, leaving only about 150,000 regional security and militia forces at the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Chinese Central Command's military assessments ignored these militias, assuming an overwhelming 8:1 advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. This proved to be a critical mistake, as Vietnamese local forces were well-trained and well-equipped, making the actual ratio closer to 2:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

### Battle Tactics
On February 17, 1979, the PLA launched an artillery barrage along the Sino-Vietnamese border, followed by 100,000 soldiers and tank units advancing towards Lang Son, Cao Bang, and Lao Cai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. Lao Cai was a key target due to its railroad link to Hanoi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

Key tactical aspects included:
*   **Lack of Air Support**: [[deng_xiaopings_role_and_strategy | Deng Xiaoping]] and Central Command restricted Chinese flying missions to Chinese airspace for political reasons, leaving infantry without aerial bombing support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.
*   **Top-Down Command**: Central Command did not allow middle and lower-ranking officers to make independent judgments or adjust to conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.
*   **Human Wave Attacks**: The PLA was forced to send "waves and waves of human soldiers" against fortifications, accepting thousands of casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.
*   **Maoist Urban Warfare Strategy**: When approaching Lang Son, the PLA followed Mao's strategy of first occupying the surrounding countryside to avoid getting bogged down once inside the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.
*   **"Butcher's Knife" Principle**: A major general was instructed to "use a butcher's knife to kill a chick," meaning to employ razor-sharp strikes to destroy enemy vital areas while avoiding their strengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>.
*   **Enduring Heavy Losses**: Despite well-fortified Vietnamese defenses, the Chinese pushed infantrymen into close massed combat to seize strategic locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.

The PLA advanced 10 miles into Vietnam, capturing border towns and pushing towards Lao Cai, which they took along with Cao Bang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. They also took two small towns en route to Dong Dang, where they encountered the Vietnamese "Flying Tiger Regiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. By March 2, Lang Son, located just 85 miles from Hanoi, was mostly surrounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. On March 3, the PLA launched a successful attack to complete the capture of Lang Son, blowing up adjacent Vietnamese artillery positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Casualties
The PLA encountered significant difficulties:
*   **Jungle Warfare**: Soldiers were unprepared for jungle fighting conditions, suffering immense casualties from tunnel and jungle warfare, booby traps, land mines, and bamboo stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.
*   **Fortified Defenses**: The Vietnamese had fortified border provinces with tunnels, caves, and trenches, which their well-armed militia effectively utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.
*   **Logistical Issues**: Rain bogged down operations, forcing PLA troops to use horses and donkeys to transport goods through difficult terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. Infantry soldiers tied themselves to tanks, making them easy targets during ambushes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.
*   **Heavy Tank Losses**: Tank units suffered especially heavy losses, with 87% experiencing some form of damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

Casualty figures vary widely, with Beijing initially claiming 20,000 killed or wounded, Hanoi asserting 42,000 Chinese casualties, and other estimates ranging from 6,900 to 25,000 PLA dead with 37,000 wounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>. Regardless of the exact numbers, a significant number of Chinese soldiers perished in the short three-week battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>.

## Conclusion and Assessment

[[deng_xiaopings_role_and_strategy | Deng Xiaoping]] and the Chinese high command emphasized from the start that the incursion would be limited and short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. This strategy succeeded in preventing Soviet intervention, as the Soviets stayed out as long as the fighting remained "limited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

On March 5, Beijing announced they had advanced 30 to 80 miles, taken the capitals of Lang Son, Cao Bang, and Lao Cai, along with 17 other areas, and severely damaged Vietnamese forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. With the Party's political goals achieved, the PLA began to withdraw, and Vietnam allowed an orderly retreat without escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.

Despite the strategic success in achieving political aims, internal Party documents acknowledged that the PLA underperformed operationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. Army planners had arrogantly claimed they could take Hanoi in a week with a fraction of their forces, but it took 16 days and 10 full divisions to capture only a third of that distance, and they did not even face the main Vietnamese army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>. The PLA's weapons were outdated, tactics needed updating from Mao's era, and morale was low due to the rigid top-down command structure, leading soldiers to feel their lives were wasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>.

The [[sinovietnamese_war_overview | Sino-Vietnamese War Overview]] highlighted how the Chinese Communist Party views war and the PLA as tools to achieve its political goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>. If the Party's goals are met, the PLA is considered successful, regardless of military performance or casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>. This approach is reminiscent of the tactics of the Red Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.

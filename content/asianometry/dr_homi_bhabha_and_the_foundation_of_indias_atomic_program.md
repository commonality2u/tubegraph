India, a nation that was among the first to advocate for a global ban on nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, saw Mahatma Gandhi in 1947 describe nuclear weapons as a "sinful and diabolical use of science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Following the Japanese atomic bombings, [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | India's first Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru]] expressed concerns that the bomb would exclusively be a weapon for killing Asians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Despite its desire for a world free of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, India became the sixth declared nuclear power on May 18, 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The foundation of this journey lies significantly with Dr. Homi Bhabha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Bhabha's Early Life and Vision

India's entire atomic program began with Dr. Homi Bhabha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Bhabha was born into a prominent and wealthy Parsi family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. His uncle by marriage was Sir Dorabji Tata, son of Tata Group founder Jamshedji Tata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Growing up, Bhabha visited his uncle and overheard conversations with members of the Indian independence movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

He earned a PhD in physics from Cambridge, with his thesis focusing on cosmic rays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, and regularly interacted with Western physics luminaries like Paul Dirac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. In the summer of 1939, Bhabha was in India for a holiday when World War II broke out in England, preventing his return to Cambridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Initially, Bhabha viewed his stay in India as a temporary disruption, desiring to return to the United Kingdom or the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. In 1940, he sought opportunities to go to Princeton or CalTech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, feeling intellectually isolated in India, which was turbulent due to its fight for independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

However, as India's independence became imminent around 1943-1944 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, Bhabha saw an opportunity to make a transformative impact and help his country overcome its colonial disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. The trustees of the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust also recognized the opportunity to retain an eminent scientist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Creation of TIFR

In March 1944, Bhabha wrote to the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust, requesting funds for a "vigorous school of research" to conduct world-class science in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This school would be centered around an individual (Bhabha himself) and granted autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, following the advice of Nobel laureate A.V. Hill regarding the creation of celebrated schools of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Consequently, the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR) was founded in 1945 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It received a lavish budget, growing 15-30% annually over its first two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, and became the "cradle of Indiaâ€™s atomic energy program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Through TIFR and his connections, Bhabha gained access to [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Prime Minster Nehru]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## The Race for Ores

One of the early challenges for India's nuclear program was securing thorium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. While thorium is non-fissile, it can be converted into fissile uranium-233 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

The Travancore principality, indirectly ruled by the United Kingdom, possessed significant rare earth ores like monazite, which contains trace amounts of thorium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:04:04]</a>. This was India's only known source of nuclear ore at the time, although uranium ores were later discovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Travancore's government leveraged its monazite reserves to support its sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. In January 1947, Sir C.P. Ramaswami Aiyar, Travancore's Dewar (like a prime minister), struck a three-year deal with the British for monazite access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

The Indian government pressured Travancore to join the union, with [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] even considering the use of air power in April 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Ultimately, Travancore's ruler overruled his Dewar, ensuring India secured its nuclear ores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Atomic Energy Commission of India

In 1948, [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] proposed establishing the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) of India, with Bhabha as its chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The commission received substantial protection within the government, with Bhabha formally answering only to the prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Bhabha and [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] often met privately and worked well together, sharing similar backgrounds like a Cambridge education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

[[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] was primarily interested in nuclear science for its potential to accelerate India's development and prestige, as the country desperately needed new energy sources for industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. While publicly opposing nuclear weapons, [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] understood global realities and kept the option open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This granted Bhabha the autonomy to build the necessary infrastructure should the need for weapons arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Finding Partners

In its early years, India leveraged its thorium and other strategic minerals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Agreements with France in 1948 and 1950 led to a monazite processing plant and joint research on beryllium-moderated reactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, marking the first bilateral international nuclear project after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. However, its benefits to India's program were limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

In 1952, Bhabha wrote to Gordon Dean, chairman of the American AEC, proposing a trade: "All declassified information on reactor theory, design and technology...together with all operational data" and 10 tons of heavy water in exchange for thorium or uranium ore and potentially beryllium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. India's resources drew the Americans to the negotiating table despite strained relations due to India's non-alignment policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The global rush for strategic nuclear-relevant ores was paramount, as acquiring them denied them to Communist nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The Americans also feared deeper Indian ties with the Soviets, especially after China's Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

An incident in July 1953, where an Indian state-owned enterprise shipped thorium nitrate to China, caused a "big problem" for the Eisenhower Administration due to the Mutual Defense Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] bristled at America's attempt to dictate India's trade partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, and a deal was eventually arranged where the Americans bought the thorium at an inflated price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. A year later, Pakistan's courting of the Americans deepened India's antipathy towards the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Criticism and "Atoms for Peace"

The AEC's power was not unlimited, and [[criticism_and_challenges_faced_by_indias_atomic_energy_commission | critics disliked Bhabha's control over India's atomic institutes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. [[criticism_and_challenges_faced_by_indias_atomic_energy_commission | Indian astrophysicist Meghnad Saha]] was particularly vocal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. In 1952, [[criticism_and_challenges_faced_by_indias_atomic_energy_commission | Saha]] won a seat in Parliament and used his position to criticize the AEC's lack of results, transparency, and its ties to private enterprises like the Tata Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

[[criticism_and_challenges_faced_by_indias_atomic_energy_commission | Saha]], a Communist aligned with the Soviet Union, stated in 1954:
> "India has got an Atomic Energy Commission and five years ago [1948] it had announced that we were going to set up a nuclear reactor within five years. This is 1954 and the nuclear reactor has not been set up... I do not know how long it will take us to make good this proposal. It may take us years to set up a nuclear reactor." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>

He argued against the notion that "atomic scientists are a special class," stating they were "ordinary chemists, ordinary physicists, biologists and others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. While [[criticism_and_challenges_faced_by_indias_atomic_energy_commission | Saha]] was a "lonely voice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, many Indians believed the pursuit of atomic energy was an expensive "boondoggle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. The AEC had become too theoretical and lacked domestic capability for a real reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Although [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] still supported the AEC, public scrutiny pushed for results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

This pressure coincided with a shift in global nuclear policy. In December 1953, Dwight Eisenhower delivered his "Atoms for Peace" speech at the UN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Eisenhower sought to present a more favorable image of atomic energy and counter the Soviets' potential nuclear technology export industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. "Atoms for Peace" abruptly reversed years of secrecy, opening doors to commercial competition in atomic energy development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. This greatly benefited India's atomic energy, and subsequently weapons, program due to the inherent duality of nuclear power and weapons development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## Bhabha's Three-Step Plan

In response to public criticism, [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] asked the AEC to hold a national conference in November 1954 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. At the "Conference on the Development of Atomic Energy for Peaceful Purposes" in New Delhi, Bhabha presented a three-step plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>:

1.  **Step One**: Build atomic reactors fueled by natural uranium with foreign assistance, producing plutonium as a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.
2.  **Step Two**: Construct new atomic reactors fueled by a mix of thorium and plutonium from the first stage, producing uranium-233 as a byproduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.
3.  **Step Three**: Mix uranium-233 with India's abundant thorium to feed "breeder" reactors, which produce more U-233 than they consume, creating an essentially unlimited supply of nuclear fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

Bhabha's plan was designed for national independence and strategic optionality, utilizing India's thorium reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. The second stage, producing plutonium, provided India the option to eventually build nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. The conference solidified Bhabha's control over India's atomic apparatus, and [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] increased the program's budget twelve-fold by 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

## Early Reactors: Apsara and CIRUS

Bhabha actively sought international aid for building a nuclear reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. In June 1954, he wrote to Sir John Cockcroft, head of the UK's Atomic Energy Authority, requesting 5 tons of heavy water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Recognizing India as the "Third World's most developed nuclear power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>, the British offered technical drawings, data, and 6 kilograms of enriched fuel rods for a "swimming pool" type research reactor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. In return, India promised special consideration for future reactor purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

Bhabha bet Cockcroft that India would complete this 1-megawatt reactor, named "Apsara," within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. He lost by a few days but everyone was "ecstatic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. Apsara went critical in August 1956, becoming Asia's first nuclear reactor outside the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] spoke at its inauguration in January 1957, highlighting that Apsara was "almost entirely" the work of young Indian scientists and builders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. Apsara was decommissioned in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

At the first "Atoms for Peace" conference in Geneva in August 1955 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, Bhabha served as president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. There, Canada proposed transferring one of their research reactors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. The final agreement involved Canada building a 40-megawatt heavy water reactor in India, named the Canadian-Indian Reactor, US (CIRUS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. Canada covered the foreign exchange costs ($14 million), and the US provided 21 tons of heavy water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. Canada initially requested that the fuel be held in international custody, but Bhabha "fiercely rejected it," asserting India's "inalienable right to hold its own fuel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. He did not believe international safeguards could stop a country's progress towards a bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. Ultimately, Canada imposed no strict restrictions beyond a promise to use the reactor for peaceful purposes, with no inspections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. Work on CIRUS began in 1956, went critical in July 1960, and reached full capacity in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

CIRUS's design encouraged the production of large amounts of weapons-grade plutonium by allowing fuel rods to be removed and replaced before they were "overcooked," preventing the creation of undesirable plutonium isotopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. Years later, Canada's "peaceful" nuclear program faced scrutiny when it was found their reactors contributed to nuclear weapons proliferation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.

## Phoenix Reprocessing Plant

Concurrently, India began constructing a plutonium reprocessing plant in Trombay called Phoenix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. This plant could extract plutonium from spent uranium nuclear fuel, like that from CIRUS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Phoenix was indigenously built with assistance from American company Vitro International, which had worked on the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. This transfer of plans was legitimate at the time, as regulators did not recognize its significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.

With CIRUS and Phoenix, India technically had a pathway to a nuclear weapon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. By 1961 or 1962, they knew they could gather enough weapons-grade plutonium for a bomb within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. This likely explains the timing of the 1962 Atomic Energy Act, which [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] hastily passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. The bill locked down information on the Indian nuclear program and granted the government legal rights to mine and seize land for nuclear development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. When Phoenix went live in June 1964, the Indian government was about a year away from having the 5-10 kilograms of weapons-grade plutonium needed for a test bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

## Hesitancy and External Pressures

Despite having the materials by 1965, India's actual production of a bomb was delayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. This was largely due to [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] and other influential groups who were against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. The Sino-Indian border clashes escalating into war on October 20, 1962, a month after the Atomic Energy Act was passed, further complicated matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. The humiliating defeat motivated India to double its military budget in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.

For the first time, a parliamentary party, the right-wing Jana Sangh Party, publicly demanded India build the bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. Yet, [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]] did not move forward with the bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>, stating, "How can we, without showing the utter insincerity of what we have always said, go in for doing the very thing which we have repeatedly asked the other powers not to do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. He believed atomic bombs would not help India's growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

[[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]]'s health declined, and he passed away in May 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. Lal Bahadur Shastri took over in June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>, immediately facing threats from Pakistan and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

## China's Influence and Bhabha's Advocacy

On September 29, 1964, the Americans publicly announced an imminent [[chinese_scientists_contributions_to_nuclear_development | Chinese nuclear weapons test]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. This deeply impacted the Indian political class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. Dr. Bhabha led a faction advocating for India to build the bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:55">[00:25:55]</a>. On October 4, 12 days before the [[chinese_scientists_contributions_to_nuclear_development | Chinese test]], he told journalists in London that India was just 18 months away from a nuclear weapon, subtly pushing for its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

On October 16, [[chinese_scientists_contributions_to_nuclear_development | China]] detonated its bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. U.S. President Lyndon Johnson downplayed it as a "crude device" and tried to dissuade India from pursuing its own weapon without solid guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. Debate raged in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. The Jana Sangh party escalated its rhetoric for a bomb, condemning the "eunuch Government" for prioritizing nuclear power over the bomb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.

A survey by the Indian Express in late October revealed that Indian elites believed Bhabha's 18-month assertion (though likely an exaggeration) but urged against rushing due to the "huge costs" amidst rising inflation and food shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. Bhabha countered this publicly on October 24 at the UN, stating that 50 atomic bombs would cost only $21 million, and 50 H-bombs $31 million, misleadingly excluding infrastructure and delivery costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.

Many in the ruling Congress Party, like R. K. Khadilkar, believed [[chinese_scientists_contributions_to_nuclear_development | China]]'s bomb was "not directed towards India" but rather at "the world powers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. Ultimately, Shastri prioritized solving the food shortage crisis over bomb development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>, advocating for a non-bomb policy and possibly a nuclear umbrella from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>. He also suggested a program of using nuclear weapons for "peaceful purposes" akin to the US's Operation Plowshare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

## Bhabha's Legacy

The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>, during which [[chinese_scientists_contributions_to_nuclear_development | China]] threatened India with nuclear retaliation (though they later blinked) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>, and the halting of US military exports to both India and Pakistan, further eroded trust in a Western nuclear umbrella <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>. This reignited calls for a bomb in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:13">[00:30:13]</a>.

In January 1966, Shastri died suddenly, and [[indias_path_to_nuclear_detonation_under_indira_gandhi | Indira Gandhi]], [[indias_early_nuclear_policy_and_nehrus_leadership | Nehru]]'s daughter, became Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. On the very day [[indias_path_to_nuclear_detonation_under_indira_gandhi | Gandhi]] was sworn in, Bhabha tragically passed away in a plane crash at 56 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. He never lived to see India become a nuclear weapons power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>. His death, along with Shastri's, left a "massive void" in India's nuclear policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

However, the foundation Bhabha laid, including the TIFR, the AEC, the securing of indigenous ores, the Three-Step Plan, and the acquisition and construction of reactors like Apsara and CIRUS, alongside the Phoenix reprocessing plant, provided the essential infrastructure and scientific capability for India's eventual nuclear detonation.

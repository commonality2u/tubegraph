During the 1970s, relations between the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union were characterized by deep mistrust and antagonism. China viewed the Soviet Union as its primary foreign policy threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## The Sino-Soviet Split

The [[SinoSoviet nuclear cooperation and its challenges | Sino-Soviet Split]] had been ongoing for a significant period, stemming from ideological disputes between Mao Zedong and Nikita Khrushchev, particularly after Khrushchev's denouncement of Stalin in his Secret Speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Despite occasional attempts by the Soviets to thaw relations, China remained distrustful due to the USSR's continued positioning of major military forces along the Soviet-Chinese borders and conducting live-ammunition exercises there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## China's Shifting Alliances

By the late 1970s, the Chinese Communist Party, under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping (who emerged as paramount leader in July 1977 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>), sought to warm relations with the West, particularly the United States, and further distance itself from the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This shift aimed to modernize China's economy and open up to the outside world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Influence on Regional Conflicts
China's foreign policy was heavily influenced by its opposition to the Soviet Union. When providing aid to Vietnam for its war against the United States, China conditioned this assistance on Vietnam not accepting any aid from the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

During the [[SinoVietnamese War of 1979 | Sino-Vietnamese War of 1979]], China's actions were partly intended to demonstrate its ability to competently fight alongside Western powers to push back Soviet influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Deng Xiaoping specifically instructed the Chinese army to limit the scope of the war to avoid getting bogged down and, crucially, to keep the Soviet Union from intervening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Chinese propaganda referred to the Vietnamese as "dogs of the Soviet Union" and the "Cuba of the East" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

China also undertook a massive evacuation of 300,000 civilians from Heilongjiang and Xinjiang, areas bordering the Soviet Union, to guard against a potential Soviet counterattack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This strategy of limiting the conflict proved successful, as the Soviets ultimately refrained from intervening, provided the fighting remained limited in scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

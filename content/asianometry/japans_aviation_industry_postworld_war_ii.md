Before World War II, Japan had a thriving aircraft industry with companies like Mitsubishi, Hitachi, Fuji, and Kawasaki involved at the government's request, primarily for military projects [01:05:22]. However, industrial development in this sector was halted after Japan lost World War II [01:17:80]. This cessation meant Japan fell behind in the technological shift from propeller planes to jets [01:23:44]. Furthermore, because the industry had previously served the government, none of the companies were commercially competitive or had experience selling to airliners [01:30:33].

## NAMC YS-11: Early Post-War Endeavor
Japan's first attempt at building a commercial plane after the war was the NAMC YS-11, a turboprop airliner that first flew in 1962 [01:41:40]. The Japanese [[mitis_role_in_japans_computer_and_software_industry_development | Ministry of International Trade and Industry]] (MITI) encouraged a consortium of Japanese companies to design and build it, aiming to replace Douglas DC-3s on short domestic routes [01:52:68]. The YS-11 was produced for a decade, shutting down in 1974 [02:04:16]. Approximately 161 units were sold to various customers [02:10:0]. Although Japan's Self-Defense Forces continued to fly the plane for many years, the project ultimately failed, incurring a $600 million loss [02:14:26].

Despite its commercial failure, the YS-11 experience allowed Japan to integrate into Boeing's supplier network [02:25:27]. Japan would later come to dominate the global commercial automobile industry [02:30:19], but the commercial plane industry consolidated into a duopoly between the United States and Europe [02:35:10].

## Japan's Role in the Global Aircraft Supply Chain
Japan became a very important supplier to Boeing [05:02:97]. Japanese companies contribute 35% of an average Boeing 787, including critical parts like the main wings [05:06:50]. This partnership is partly due to political requirements mandating Boeing to allocate some production to Japanese manufacturers, acting as a technology transfer agreement [09:21:99]. Japan has leveraged such strategies to build the capabilities of its domestic companies [09:32:41].

## The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (SpaceJet) Project
In 2003, the modern-day Japanese MITI, now the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, initiated a five-year, $400 million program to study an indigenous regional jet [03:53:14]. The original plan was for a 30 to 50-seat aircraft, but this was upscaled to 70 to 90 seats based on market demand projections for 4,500+ units over the next 20 years [04:08:29].

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) was selected to lead the project [04:23:19]. They exhibited a concept in 2007 and officially launched the program a year later [04:26:40]. Mitsubishi founded a subsidiary, Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation, with partners like Toyota [04:32:20]. This was Japan's first commercial aircraft project in nearly 50 years [04:39:79], and Mitsubishi itself had not developed a commercial plane since the MC-20 in 1940 [04:44:81]. MHI is Japan's largest military supplier, with experience producing fighter jets [04:52:16].

Mitsubishi aimed to capture 20% market share of the 70 to 90-seat regional jet market [05:26:71]. Two specifications were planned: the MRJ90 (85-90 seats) and the MRJ70 (70-80 seats) [05:32:15]. The jet was positioned as a high-tech, stylish, comfortable, and fuel-efficient passenger jet, claiming a 20% to 30% fuel reduction over competitors [05:44:81]. The Japanese government contributed hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies to develop technologies like carbon composite molding and advanced aerodynamic design [06:13:30].

The MRJ needed to achieve three milestones: finalize design, build the supply chain and start manufacturing (culminating in first flight), and pass flight tests for certification [06:29:0]. The original 2008 plan targeted a 2013 launch date with $1.3 billion in development costs, requiring 300 to 400 unit sales to break even [06:51:75]. Orders were received from Japan Airlines, ANA, and US-based SkyWest and Eastern Airlines [07:02:88].

### Design Changes and Delays
The initial design featured drastically swept-back wings made of a significant percentage of carbon-based composite materials [07:50:50]. However, in September 2009, the design changed, with main wings becoming aluminum and only rear wings made of carbon composites, reducing the overall composite percentage from 30% to 10-15% [08:19:0]. This change, possibly due to supply chain constraints or concerns about composite durability in regional jets (which undergo frequent takeoffs/landings), led to the first six-month delay, pushing the first flight to Q2 2012 and deliveries to early 2014 [08:35:0].

Boeing, which does not produce its own regional jet, offered strategic and technical consultation to Mitsubishi [09:49:50]. In 2010, a Boeing executive suggested using the Boeing 737 cockpit for the MRJ, which would have saved time and costs by leveraging Boeing's global supply network and pilot familiarity [10:11:47]. However, Japanese government policy required at least 30% domestic sourcing for the plane [10:36:58].

Despite this, in 2010, Mitsubishi announced the design lock and began aircraft assembly in April 2011 [10:57:72]. Over the next three years, Mitsubishi struggled to build its supply network [11:09:68]. Aircraft parts are highly precise, difficult to manufacture, and often made by a small group of suppliers [11:15:33]. Mitsubishi often paid twice as much as Boeing for particular parts [11:51:50].

This supply chain struggle led to the second program delay in April 2012, pushing the first flight to Q3 2013 and deliveries to mid-2015 [11:58:62]. Despite a significant order from SkyWest Airlines for 100 MRJ90s (with an option for another 100) worth $4.2 billion [12:17:80], the program remained in the red due to high part costs [12:35:28]. Mitsubishi raised its sales target from 1,000 to 1,500 units, with a break-even point of 750 planes [12:39:27].

In August 2013, a third delay was announced due to needing more time with supply partners, pushing first delivery to mid-2017 [12:56:90]. The rollout ceremony, signaling completed assembly, took place in October 2014 [13:13:58]. The first flight occurred a year later in November 2015 at Nagoya Airport, seemingly successfully [13:46:17].

However, extensive internal flight tests and type certification flights (at least 2,500 hours, mostly in the US) were still required [14:05:89]. This led to a fourth delay in 2015, pushing first deliveries to Q3 2018 [14:31:0]. This critically aligned the MRJ's release with Embraer's E2 series, which used the same Pratt & Whitney engine, negating the MRJ's initial 20% fuel consumption advantage [14:41:40]. By 2016, the program budget had ballooned to nearly $3 billion [14:54:99].

### Certification Challenges and Project Freezing
Type certification (TC) tests proved very challenging due to misinterpretations and a lack of proper documentation, leading to a fifth delay [15:14:87]. A significant issue arose from the engineering team's wire design lacking proper documentation, making it impossible to explain to regulators why it was wired in a particular way, especially after the TWA Flight 800 explosion spurred tighter aircraft wiring certifications [15:30:17]. Instead of reworking 23,000 wires individually, the company decided to redo the entire wiring, tantamount to a total internal redesign [16:00:26]. This pushed delivery dates to mid-2020 [16:13:84]. Four of the five delays were attributed to a "sloppy lack of documentation" [16:18:67].

In response, Mitsubishi changed its organizational structure, hired more experienced foreign engineers, and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' president took more direct control [16:35:10]. The project's profitability seemed unlikely [16:56:77].

In June 2019, the MRJ was rebranded as the Mitsubishi SpaceJet [17:01:21]. The MRJ90 became the SpaceJet M90, and the MRJ70 was reworked into the SpaceJet M100 to address concerns from major US regional airlines like SkyWest and Trans States Holdings, which held 70% of the order book [17:15:33]. These changes were made to comply with scope clauses in major airline pilot union contracts that influence airplane seat numbers and maximum takeoff weight [17:48:50].

This rework led to a sixth delay in January 2020, pushing deliveries to 2021 or beyond, as the new design could not acquire certification before then [18:03:70]. Simultaneously, the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted global air travel [18:21:46]. A Type Certification flight for an MJ-90 unit was delayed due to pandemic lockdowns [18:27:14].

In March 2020, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries reported its first quarterly loss in 20 years [18:36:20]. By May 2020, Mitsubishi halved its SpaceJet development plan, postponed production, reduced personnel, and closed US development centers, repatriating work to Japan [18:43:40]. In October 2020, Mitsubishi announced a three-year pause on all SpaceJet M90 development, laying off 95% of Mitsubishi Aircraft employees [18:56:46]. The company would only maintain its certification documentation, anticipating an air travel recovery in 2024 [19:09:47].

### Conclusion
The SpaceJet program's journey, marked by six delays, over ten years of development, and nearly $9 billion spent, was frozen in 2020 [00:00:0]. Mitsubishi Aircraft became insolvent and operates with a skeleton crew [00:17:19]. This outcome reflects the immense difficulty of building cutting-edge commercial aircraft [19:17:19]. While the company made progress, the program's functional death, with liquidation and a three-year pause, signifies a massive loss of experience, talent, and resources, making revival a significant challenge [20:03:0].

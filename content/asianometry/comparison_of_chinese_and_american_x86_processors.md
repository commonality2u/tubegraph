## Overview of x86 Processors and China's Market
The x86 instruction set architecture (ISA) is foundational to many computing devices, with Intel and AMD being the two major companies producing and selling chips using this ISA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | China]] represents a massive market for these companies; in 2020, Intel sold $20 billion worth of processors to China, while AMD sold $2.3 billion, figures comparable to or even higher than their sales in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

Despite being a significant consumer of American x86 technology, [[Chinas involvement in x86 processor development | China]] has actively pursued the development of its own homegrown x86 processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This interest stems from several factors:
*   **National Security Concerns** The Edward Snowden revelations regarding American spying heightened global alarm about the implementation of U.S. technologies in critical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Competition** Growing competition between [[comparisons_of_ethnocentrism_in_china_and_the_united_states | China]] and the United States, especially after the era of openness following the Sino-Soviet split, has increased tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **National Pride and Industrial Policy** [[comparisons_of_ethnocentrism_in_china_and_the_united_states | China]] desires to foster domestic "national champions" in critical industries like high-speed rail, solar, space, and now, [[implications_of_chinese_semiconductor_advancements | computer chips]], driven by a strong sense of national and patriotic pride <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Response to U.S. Sanctions** Actions by the Trump administration, such as cutting off companies like Huawei from American technologies, reinforced [[Chinas involvement in x86 processor development | China's]] fears and spurred on domestic development efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Chinese Homegrown x86 Initiatives
[[Chinas involvement in x86 processor development | China]] has two primary lineages of homegrown x86 chips in its market: Zhaoxin and Haiguang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Zhaoxin
Zhaoxin is the older of the two lineages, having released CPUs since 2014, marketed as domestically made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Joint Venture** Zhaoxin is a fabless semiconductor joint venture between the Shanghai municipal government and a Taiwanese company called Via Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **x86 License Acquisition** Via Technologies is one of the rare companies holding an x86 architectural license, which it obtained through the 1999 purchases of Cyrix and Centaur Technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Via's acquisition of Centaur led to a patent battle with Intel, culminating in a 10-year cross-license agreement in 2003, with a three-year grace period granted in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Architecture and Performance** Zhaoxin architectures, now in their sixth generation, are direct descendants of Centaur Technologies' work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. For instance, the 2015 third-generation ZXC (Zhangjiang) architecture is considered identical to Centaur's Isaiah 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Tests on the latest sixth-generation Luchador SoCs indicate that their performance is about four to eight years behind the latest American designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. They consume less power than traditional desktop chips, aligning with their mobile and IoT origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Overall, they are deemed sufficient for [[Chinas involvement in x86 processor development | China's]] low-end computing needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Foundry and Future** Zhaoxin, being a fabless company, has been trying to shift its manufacturing from TSMC to a mainland alternative like SMIC for national security reasons, which is likely causing delays and performance losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Zhaoxin has also announced plans to enter the discrete GPU market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Haiguang (Hygon)
The second major x86 joint venture initiative in [[Chinas involvement in x86 processor development | China]] was established by AMD in 2015, at a time when the company was struggling financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Joint Venture Structure** AMD formed a two-layer joint venture, collectively named Tianjin Haiguang Advanced Technology Investment Co-limited (THATIC), to provide the Chinese market with a version of its Zen 1 x86 chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
    *   The first part is Hai Guang Micro Electronics (HMC), 51% owned by AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
    *   The second is Chengdu Haiguang Integrated Circuit Design Company (Hygon), of which AMD only owns 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Technology Transfer Mechanism** The process was designed to allow [[chip_design_process_and_techniques | AMD]] to control its intellectual property while enabling [[Chinas involvement in x86 processor development | China]] to claim the chips as homegrown:
    1.  [[chip_design_process_and_techniques | AMD]] creates IP for a special x86 server chip and hands it to HMC (AMD's majority-controlled subsidiary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
    2.  HMC removes sensitive elements before passing the design to Hygon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
    3.  Hygon makes its own changes and updates, including designing the chip's top-level architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
    4.  The chip design is then returned to HMC and [[chip_design_process and techniques | AMD]] for approval and finalization, before being sent to GlobalFoundries for fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
    5.  Finally, the chips are given back to Hygon for packaging and sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **U.S. Government Scrutiny** [[chip_design_process and techniques | AMD]] stated it briefed the U.S. Departments of Defense and Commerce and received approval for the joint venture, though the Department of Defense reportedly disagreed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. While [[chip_design_process and techniques | AMD]] claimed the chips were for commercial purposes, job postings and interviews in [[Chinas involvement in x86 processor development | China]] suggested they would be used in new exa-scale supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. In 2019, THATIC was placed on an entity list, and [[chip_design_process and techniques | AMD]] agreed to cease further technology transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Overall Comparison and Future Outlook
Chinese x86 chips, while representing significant domestic effort, still lag many years behind their American-made competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Performance Gap** The latest Zhaoxin chips are 4-8 years behind current American designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Market Viability** As long as Intel and [[the_role_of_amd_and_intel_in_china | AMD]] chips remain available in [[Chinas involvement in x86 processor development | China]], consumers are likely to opt for the far better, commercially available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Export Limitations** Any chips produced by Chinese companies in this area are primarily for domestic consumption and likely cannot be exported due to potential litigation and lack of competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

While x86 has historically held a strong position, its dominance is being challenged. ARM processors are gaining ground in areas previously exclusive to x86, such as desktops and servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. In [[Chinas involvement in x86 processor development | China]], x86 development is a niche within the broader indigenous semiconductor efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The primary focus for [[Chinas involvement in x86 processor development | China's]] semiconductor industry is on [[the_significance_of_arm_and_riscv_in_chinas_semiconductor_industry | ARM-based designs]], which constitute an estimated 95% of computer chips designed in [[Chinas involvement in x86 processor development | China]], followed by the open-source [[the_significance_of_arm_and_riscv_in_chinas_semiconductor_industry | RISC-V]] instruction set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

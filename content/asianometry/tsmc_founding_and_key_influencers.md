While much of the Western media tends to overlook the detailed history of [[TSMC]] after its initial founding, the period between its establishment and the present day is described as enthralling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. The company's success is attributed to its ability to navigate technically challenging decisions, often leapfrogging rivals due to the collective brilliance of its executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:08">[03:03:08]</a>.

## Founding Geniuses and Early Talent Pool

[[TSMC]] was built upon the return of brilliant semiconductor minds from the United States to Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Leaving comfortable, high-salary positions in the U.S., which was then a leader in semiconductor technology, to join a peculiar Taiwanese company raised eyebrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

Key figures who played significant roles in the early development and growth of [[TSMC]] include:

*   **Liang Mong-song**: Described as one of [[TSMC]]'s "founding geniuses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> and brightest rising stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, he was unquestionably brilliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. After graduating from NCKU in Tainan, Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, he pursued graduate studies at the University of California, Berkeley, under Professor Hu Ten-ming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Liang worked at AMD for over a decade, accumulating over 180 critical semiconductor patents and publishing over 350 technical papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. He joined [[TSMC]]'s R&D department in 1992 at the age of 40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. He was a specialist in FinFET technology, which would later become critical for [[TSMC]]'s transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Professor Hu Ten-ming**: A "[[TSMC]] legend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, he was one of the company's first technical hires and eventually served as its chief technology officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. In the mid-2010s, he helped bring FinFET to market, aiding [[TSMC]] in a transition few other semiconductor foundries achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Morris Chang**: The most famous of the American migrants, he founded [[TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. He retired as CEO in 2005 at age 74 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, but returned in 2009 to guide the company through challenging years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Chang Yi**: R&D team leader and future CTO, he came from Texas Instruments and Hewlett-Packard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. He was a recipient of the 2003 Outstanding Scientific and Technological Worker Award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Rick Tsai**: Formerly of Cornell and Hewlett-Packard, he briefly served as [[TSMC]]'s CEO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. He was Morris Chang's chosen successor in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Douglas Yu**: From the Georgia Institute of Technology and Bell Labs, he is now a [[TSMC]] distinguished fellow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Burlingame "Berlin" Lin**: Senior director of R&D, also received the 2003 Outstanding Scientific and Technological Worker Award <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. He is renowned for leading the industry transition to 193 nanometer immersion lithography, which allowed [[TSMC]] to surpass Japanese lithography makers like Canon and Nikon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Early Technical Achievements and Innovation

One of [[TSMC]]'s most significant technical advancements occurred in 2003 with the adoption of copper interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. While the industry had long used aluminum interconnects, copper offered 40% less resistance, 15% faster speed, and smaller sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The challenge lay in manufacturing, as copper atoms could diffuse into silicon, requiring a difficult-to-construct metal barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

In 1997, IBM announced the industry's first copper interconnect implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. However, their technology could not move beyond the laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. In the early 2000s, IBM offered to license their technology to [[TSMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. [[TSMC]]'s R&D team, believing copper was the future but rejecting IBM's specific implementation, invested heavily to create their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

Within about a year, a team of six elite [[TSMC]] R&D scientists, led by Liang Mong-song, developed their own 130 nanometer process node with copper interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. By 2003, they began shipping wafers using this technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This event allowed [[TSMC]] to surpass IBM in this critical area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The Taiwan government recognized this achievement by awarding the 2003 Outstanding Scientific and Technological Worker Award to Chang Yi, Liang Mong-song, and Burlingame Lin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

Liang Mong-song's technical brilliance was evident throughout his career at [[TSMC]], where he was named on nearly 500 patents and possessed an obsessive dedication to technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. He received substantial compensation, earning over $21 million USD in stock and cash over his 17 years at the company, including over $1 million annually during the 2000s when the average Taiwanese income was $15,000-$22,000 a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics and Challenges

Despite his brilliance, Liang's stubborn nature led to frequent clashes with colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. He was described as "very strict on technology" and inflexible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. His personality was likened to Lu Bu, a mighty Chinese general known for his ferocity and willingness to betray allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

A "game of thrones" unfolded within [[TSMC]]'s ranks, particularly after Morris Chang's retirement in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. When Chang Yi retired, the vacant senior R&D VP position was split into two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. While Dr. Lo Wei-jen filled one role, Liang believed he was the best candidate for the second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. However, advisor Chang chose Jack Sun, a rival of Liang's, who possessed a broader view of [[TSMC]]'s operations and better interpersonal skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Morris Chang decided to transfer Liang to a new initiative focused on "beyond more" or "more than more" â€“ expanding [[TSMC]]'s trailing edge foundry capabilities into new verticals like MEMS, automotive sensors, and advanced packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. While this is a growing business for [[TSMC]] today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, it was small at the time, starting with a four-person office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This move, seen as a banishment to a far-off province due to Liang's obsession with the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, fueled his resentment and feeling of being cast aside by company leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

Liang's defection to [[Competition between TSMC and Samsung | Samsung]] in 2011, after a two-year non-compete clause, brought significant challenges and competitive shifts, fundamentally impacting the landscape of the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

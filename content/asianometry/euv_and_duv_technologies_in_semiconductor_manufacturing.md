Germany-based Carl Zeiss AG plays a crucial role in semiconductor manufacturing by producing the "optics systems" at the heart of multi-million dollar photolithography machines made by ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Without these systems, ASML cannot supply companies like TSMC, Samsung, or Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Carl Zeiss's optics systems enable high-energy UV light to etch patterns on wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, even patterns as wide as a small virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Carl Zeiss SMT: A Strategic Partnership

Carl Zeiss SMT, the semiconductor manufacturing division, is a joint venture with ASML, where Carl Zeiss AG holds the majority share and ASML has a 24.9% stake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The division's core product is the optics at the heart of ASML's lithography scanners and steppers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. In 2020, the semiconductor division generated 1.8 billion Euro in revenue, growing 12% year-over-year while other divisions saw declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. It contributes 30% of the group's business and holds critical strategic importance in German industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

## Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) Lithography

Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) lithography utilizes ultraviolet light rays in the 193 nanometer or 248 nanometer range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. DUV techniques currently power the majority of process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Evolution of DUV Optics at Zeiss
Carl Zeiss has been building deep ultraviolet imaging systems for nearly 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Early Concepts**: Carl Abb√©, a physicist recruited by Zeiss, proposed the possibility of a microscope using ultraviolet light as early as 1874 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Quartz Lenses**: By 1899, the company developed a quartz lens suitable for UV microscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Microlithography Lenses**: In the 1960s, Zeiss began leveraging its microscope techniques to build the first-ever lenses for microlithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### Challenges and Innovations in DUV
Microlithography demands tight control over light distortions across a relatively large space to ensure accurate transfer of IC designs to silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Multi-component Optics**: A single lens was insufficient, so Zeiss combined multiple smaller lenses into massive optics systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Field Curvature Reduction**: The "double bulge" and "funny looking bulge and waist" structure of these systems reduce field curvature, an optical problem that causes parts of the image to be out of sharp focus, leading to inaccuracies in lithography <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Resolution Improvements**: Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Zeiss refined its techniques to increase the resolution of IC design projection onto wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Immersion Lithography
In the 2000s, immersion lithography provided a breakthrough in resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Instead of an air gap between the wafer and the stepper, water is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. First proposed for semiconductor use by Taiwanese scientist Burn Lin, this technique allowed foundries to etch structures as small as 40 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Zeiss's leading products for this technique are the Starlith 1900 series, including the 1900i, which are among the company's best-selling products ever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Building these required a brand new factory and overcoming substantial engineering [[Challenges in developing EUV systems | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

## [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Lithography]]

[[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV lithography]] is the next step in the semiconductor fabrication roadmap and is a disruptive technology used in today's cutting-edge process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

### [[EUV lithography technology and its challenges | Challenges]] and Optics System Design
The shift to a new wavelength in [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] necessitated radical changes to the optics system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The key [[EUV lithography technology and its challenges | challenge]] is that all available materials, including air, absorb high-energy UV light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This means traditional lenses are not possible as UV light cannot pass through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Consequently, Zeiss had to design an optic system entirely out of multi-layer mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

### [[The evolution of EUV lithography | Development of Zeiss EUV Optics]]
*   **Initiation**: Zeiss began working on its [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] optic system in 1995 with a micro exposure tool, a smaller version of the final product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Prototypes and Refinement**: Collaborating with Lawrence Livermore National Lab and Berkeley Lab, Zeiss delivered the first prototype in 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a> and continued to refine the design five times over the next few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **First Full-Field System**: In 2015, the Starlith 3100, the first full-field [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] optic system, was delivered for ASML's Alpha Demo Tool (ADT), the ASML ADT NXE 3100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Starlith System Components**: The Starlith is a multi-component system comprising:
    *   Collector optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>
    *   Aperture illumination optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>
    *   Reticle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>
    *   Projection optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>
*   **Light Path**: Light from the [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] source hits the collector, which projects it through the aperture into the illuminator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. The illuminator spreads the light evenly, which then reflects off the reticle (containing IC chip designs) and is finally projected onto the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Further Refinements**: The Starlith 3100 pioneered the optical system's core mechanics, which were later refined in subsequent releases like the Starlith 3300 and 3400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

Today, [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] makes up a critical part of [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]]-based process nodes at 7 nanometers or lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. The complexity of Zeiss's [[Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography Technology | EUV]] and DUV optic systems is "fantastically complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>, making it challenging for competitors like [[Japans semiconductor industry and EUV | Japan-based Nikon and Canon]] to catch up, as they make their own optics systems, an arrangement that has not worked as well as ASML's partnership with Zeiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

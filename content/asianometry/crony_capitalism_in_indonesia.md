From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Crony capitalism became deeply entrenched in Indonesia, particularly during the [[Economic policies and reforms in Suhartos Indonesia | Suharto]] regime. This system saw close ties between the government and a select group of businesses, allowing for immense wealth accumulation for those connected to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

## Historical Roots of Corruption

Long before [[Economic policies and reforms in Suhartos Indonesia | Suharto]] ascended to power, the military and the business community were intricately and corruptly intertwined in Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

During the 1950s, the Republican government often failed to adequately fund its fighting units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This led commanders to unite with local businessmen, known as "kukong" (Hokkian for "Boss," often ethnic Chinese), to raise necessary funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. In exchange for funneling cash to the military, these businessmen received favors and concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

After Indonesia gained independence and Dutch assets were nationalized, the government increasingly relied on the military to provide daily services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. This broadened the military's involvement in various sectors, from shipping to hotels and timber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

## The Suharto Era: A Crony Capitalist Pyramid

The existing structure of military-business ties significantly strengthened after [[Economic policies and reforms in Suhartos Indonesia | Suharto]] became president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Throughout his 32-year presidency, [[Economic policies and reforms in Suhartos Indonesia | Suharto]] meticulously crafted a crony capitalist political pyramid that collected rents across a wide range of economic activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. These "rents" flowed upwards to [[Economic policies and reforms in Suhartos Indonesia | Suharto]] himself and his inner circle of elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

The government strategically partnered with economic cronies in the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. These partners received preferential benefits to help achieve government goals, while also generating profits for redistribution within the elite circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. [[Economic policies and reforms in Suhartos Indonesia | Suharto]] and his government carefully separated economic and political power; his Chinese business partners, for instance, relied on him for their protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

### The Rise of Salim Group

Lim Sioe Liong (also known as Sudono Salim), founder of the Salim Group, exemplifies the success possible under this system due to [[Suhartos relationship with the business elite | his personal connection to Suharto]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. [[Suhartos relationship with the business elite | Suharto]], a personal friend of Lim, leaned on the Salim Group as a core collaborator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Lim became [[Suhartos relationship with the business elite | Suharto]]'s "go-to guy for all money matters," and in turn, [[Suhartos relationship with the business elite | Suharto]] became Lim's patron and protector as he rose through military ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

Initially, Lim was one of many Chinese "kukong" but quickly rose to become the biggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

*   **Clove Monopoly:** In 1966, the government granted Lim one of two exclusive licenses to import cloves, a critical ingredient for Indonesia's "kretek" cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. While Lim's company received a small percentage of profits, the majority went to a slush fund owned by the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This provided crucial early funds for Lim's expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Flour and Food Monopoly:** In 1969, Lim founded Bogasari Flour Mills, which quickly received a monopoly for the import, milling, and distribution of wheat for Western Indonesia, covering 80% of the country's population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This was an immensely profitable business, with 25-35% profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Again, a significant share (26%) of the company's profits was designated for foundations headed by [[Suhartos relationship with the business elite | Suharto]] and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. The Salim Group's food business later expanded into Indofood, one of the world's biggest food companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Cement Industry:** The Salim Group demonstrated competence in executing government development plans, such as building domestic cement capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. [[Suhartos relationship with the business elite | Suharto]] specifically directed Lim to enter this industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. During Indonesia's oil export boom in the 1970s, Lim built one of the world's largest cement companies, controlling 60% of Indonesia's total cement production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. When oil prices tumbled in 1984, [[Suhartos relationship with the business elite | Suharto]] ordered the government to purchase 35% of what is now PT Indocement to bail out Lim's company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Banking (BCA):** Lim also owned Bank Central Asia (BCA), which became Indonesia's biggest private bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Shares in BCA were distributed to several of [[Suhartos relationship with the business elite | Suharto]]'s generals and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. BCA leveraged its connections to Lim's empire by banking customers from his various businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

By the mid-1980s, the Salim Group expanded dramatically, reaching over 225 affiliated businesses by 1986 and an estimated 350 separate companies by 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Many of these companies operated as monopolies or near-monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, such as Indomobile Group receiving attractive government orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

### The Role of Suharto's Children

In [[Economic policies and reforms in Suhartos Indonesia | Suharto]]'s later years, his children began to exert their political influence, often to the detriment of public opinion due to their incompetence and self-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. An infamous example occurred in 1990 when [[Economic policies and reforms in Suhartos Indonesia | Suharto]] created a single clove monopoly for his youngest son, Tommy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. This led to Tommy mismanaging the industry to the point where [[Economic policies and reforms in Suhartos Indonesia | Suharto]] had to order Bank Indonesia to contribute $350 million to bail out the monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

## Impact of the Asian Financial Crisis

The [[impact_of_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | Asian financial crisis]] of 1997-1998 exposed the fragilities of Indonesia's crony capitalist system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   **Currency Devaluation and Debt:** When Thailand floated its currency in July 1997, it sparked a contagion across Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. Indonesia's rupiah lost over 30% of its value, severely impacting banks due to their dollar-denominated debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.
*   **Banking Crisis:** Intense competition among banks due to earlier reforms, coupled with high non-performing loans, led to widespread insolvencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. In October 1997, 16 commercial banks closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>. Rumors and fear triggered a massive run on banks, including BCA, which collapsed despite initial resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. The central bank had to take over BCA and its $5 billion in debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **IMF Bailout and Reforms:** The IMF intervened with a $33 billion bailout package in October 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>. This came with stringent conditions, including dismantling state and private monopolies, cutting subsidies, and further opening the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. These reforms directly targeted monopolies dominated by [[Suhartos relationship with the business elite | Suharto]]'s cronies and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

### Fall of Suharto and Salim Group's Restructuring

The economic crisis and IMF-imposed reforms created widespread discontent, leading to mass riots and pro-democracy student demonstrations in May 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. Many of these riots targeted ethnic Chinese and their businesses, including Lim's home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. On May 21, 1998, [[Economic policies and reforms in Suhartos Indonesia | Suharto]] resigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

With [[Economic policies and reforms in Suhartos Indonesia | Suharto]]'s fall, the Salim Empire began to break apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. The government demanded that the Salim Group hand over stakes in over 100 Indonesian businesses, including Indocement and Indomobile, to repay the $5 billion bailout for BCA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. However, the Salim family managed to retain a 50.1% share in Indofood, strategically moving those holdings offshore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.

## Legacy

While [[Economic policies and reforms in Suhartos Indonesia | Suharto]]'s governance brought substantial economic benefits to Indonesia, including 7% annual economic growth and the development of agricultural and manufacturing bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>, it also disproportionately enriched him, his cronies, and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>.

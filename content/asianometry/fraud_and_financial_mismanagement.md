The Daewoo Group, once Korea's fourth-largest business conglomerate, experienced a rapid rise fueled by a favorable political environment and significant debt, but ultimately collapsed due to its liabilities, a crushing recession, and widespread fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This collapse severely damaged the legacy of its founder and chairman, Kim Woo-Choong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Financial Strategies and Debt Accumulation

Daewoo Industrial, founded in 1967, started small but quickly grew through ambitious strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. A key early gambit involved sacrificing profits and product quality to gain market share in textiles before a US import quota was imposed, which resulted in Daewoo being awarded 30% of the quota in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. This "de facto monopoly" provided cash flow for future expansions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

The company's expansion into various industries like machinery, shipbuilding, construction, and automobiles in the 1970s often came through acquiring struggling companies and turning them around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Daewoo's general playbook focused on market share over profits, high volume, and low prices, with little emphasis on upgrading technologies or moving upscale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. The company also heavily focused on exports, particularly to emerging countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

### [[corruption_and_political_ties_in_south_korea | Political Ties]] and Preferential Loans

Daewoo's rapid growth was inextricably linked to its close relationship with the Korean government, particularly founder Kim Woo-Choong's ties to President Park Chung-hee, whose primary school principal was Kim's father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. The company regularly hired government elites and retired state bankers, which helped secure "absurdly favorable loans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. While private banks charged high interest rates (sometimes over 40% annual inflation), Daewoo's loans were in the 6-9% range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. In return for these benefits, Daewoo and other chaebol contributed hundreds of millions of dollars to presidential slush funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

### Complex Cross-Ownership Structure

Initially, Daewoo's core holding company was privately owned by the founder and his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. In the 1970s, the government demanded that chaebol take their holding companies public to provide liquidity to Korean stock markets and allow public participation in economic efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. To maintain control while offering stock, Daewoo, like other chaebol, established a complex cross-ownership structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. By 1997, Kim and his family owned only 6.1% of shares on average but controlled 38.3% of votes due to subsidiaries owning shares in each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. This structure made it nearly impossible for shareholders to challenge Kim and obscured which parts of the group were profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

### Moral Hazard and Reckless Expansion

After President Park Chung-hee's assassination in 1979, the regulatory and economic climate shifted, with markets opening to foreign competition and cheap loans drying up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. Despite these changes, Daewoo continued to hold close political ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

In 1988, Daewoo Shipbuilding and Heavy Machinery, carrying $1.8 billion in debt, faced near-bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. Kim argued the shipyard was taken on at Park's request and the Korea Development Bank had not provided promised equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. In 1989, the government bailed out Daewoo Shipbuilding with 200 billion Korean Won in preferential loans and injected another 50 billion Won directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. This rescue "reaffirmed Daewoo's closeness to the government" and created a "moral hazard," where Kim believed the government would always intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.

Despite a brief attempt at quality improvement in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>, Kim reverted to aggressive expansion, particularly in the unprofitable car business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. In 1992, Daewoo acquired full control of its motor subsidiary, which was losing $200 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. Daewoo Motors embarked on a massive global buying spree, acquiring 14 car factories in 13 countries, including a Polish car company for $1.8 billion and an $800 million plant in Uzbekistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>. Many of these ventures failed, leading to significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:03:00">[14:03:00]</a>. This culminated in a majority takeover of the troubled Ssangyong Motor Company in January 1998, at the peak of the Asian Financial Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>.

All chaebol used debt, with an average debt-to-equity ratio of 400% in the 1980s and 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>. However, Daewoo carried the most debt—over $11 billion into the 1990s—and was structurally vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. Unlike other chaebol with profitable "cash cow" core companies, Daewoo's core, Daewoo Corporation, was a trading and financial company that prioritized revenues over profits and funded its subsidiaries through borrowings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>.

## The Unraveling and Discovery of Fraud

The [[financial_strategies_and_challenges_faced_by_evergrande | Asian Financial Crisis]] began in 1997, causing the Korean Won to plunge and the economy to shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. While other chaebol pulled back, Daewoo "plunged ahead recklessly," discounting products and acquiring new companies, adding more debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>. Throughout 1998, Daewoo raised another $14.1 billion, becoming Korea's most indebted company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>. Investors likely believed the Korean government would bail them out again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>.

However, the government, having been in discussions with Daewoo since June 1998 regarding austerity measures Kim resisted, changed its stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>. In late 1998, realizing the financial contagion risk of a Daewoo debt default, the government told financial institutions they could only hold 5% of their portfolio in Daewoo Group debt, effectively cutting off Daewoo's credit lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>. Kim's confidence that the government would ease reforms and bail out Daewoo was shattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:00">[17:37:00]</a>.

### The Fraudulent Accounting Practices

In December 1998, Daewoo finally agreed to downsize, consolidating 51 operating companies into 10 and reducing its debt ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>. However, this restructuring lacked teeth, and creditor banks failed to withdraw funding when Daewoo missed its debt reduction targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>. Rumors of last-second deals and special relationships with the incoming president kept the belief that Daewoo would stay afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>.

The reality was that by the end of 1998, Daewoo was already a bankrupt entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>. While the company reported a half-trillion Korean Won profit loss for 1998, management claimed core companies were generating profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>. These reported profits were generated through a scheme of "fictitious overseas asset sales" between sister subsidiaries at inflated, fake prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:00">[19:48:00]</a>. Removing these fraudulent practices revealed Daewoo didn't lose half a trillion Won but actually four trillion Won, eight times the reported amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">[20:27:00]</a>. Other estimates put the fraud in 1997 and 1998 as high as 23 trillion Won (about $19 billion), making it Korea's biggest accounting fraud up to that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>. The company was undeniably insolvent, a "dead man walking" with far more liabilities than assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>.

## Consequences and Aftermath

In July 1999, Kim Woo-Choong made a final attempt to save the company, offering his personal wealth as collateral and asking creditors to inject another 4 trillion Won ($3.4 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:05:00">[21:05:00]</a>. However, in August 1999, Kim was removed, and Daewoo's subsidiaries were placed into [[bankruptcy_and_restructuring_of_hna_group | bankruptcy]] to be sold off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:41:00">[21:41:00]</a>. At its end, Daewoo owed over $50 billion in debt to 140 banks in over 100 countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.

Kim fled the country in November 1999, living in exile for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58:00">[21:58:00]</a>. Upon his return, he was sentenced to a large fine and a ten-year prison sentence, though he received a presidential pardon less than a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:04:00">[22:04:00]</a>.

The Daewoo collapse had far-reaching consequences:
*   **Financial Sector**: Banks and insurance companies lost trillions of Won, requiring the Korean government to inject public money to prevent further collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:18:00">[22:18:00]</a>.
*   **Reforms**: It led to extensive [[reforms_in_south_korean_business_practices | reforms]] in investor transparency and banking oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>.
*   **Accounting Industry**: The scale of the fraud highlighted failures by accountants, leading to fines, license suspensions, and reforms in the Korean accounting industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:33:00">[22:33:00]</a>.
*   **Missing Money**: Between $750 million and $4 billion remains missing from the company's coffers, possibly used for personal expenses or government bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:51:00">[22:51:00]</a>.

Today, former Daewoo companies operate independently, some still bearing the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:12:00">[23:12:00]</a>. Daewoo's rapid growth and spectacular implosion serve as a cautionary tale of unchecked ambition, excessive debt, and financial fraud.

The Australian automobile industry, which once employed 100,000 people and produced tens of thousands of vehicles for domestic use and export, has largely vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The last major factory, operated by Toyota, closed in 2017, leaving the country with virtually no car-making industry, save for a few units for national security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This decline is closely tied to the operations and decisions of foreign multinational companies that dominated the sector.

## Early Development and Foreign Investment

Following World War II, the Australian government actively sought to rebuild its economy and foster manufacturing capacity, prioritizing car manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. To achieve this, it offered foreign companies subsidies and tax concessions to establish production in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Several foreign manufacturers, including Volkswagen, British Motors Leyland, and Ford, entered the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. While most facilities focused on assembling imported parts, some, like the Australian subsidiary of American automaker GM Holden, brought more value-add activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

GM Holden produced the first "all-Australian" car in Melbourne in 1948, known simply as the Holden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This rugged vehicle was uniquely suited for Australia's rural areas and quickly dominated the market throughout the 1950s, with waiting lists stretching for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. By 1951, Holden had sold over 25,000 units and was the country's most profitable publicly traded company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## The Dual Nature of Foreign Ownership

A key characteristic of the Australian car industry was that none of the significant car manufacturing companies were actually owned by Australians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This foreign ownership presented both advantages and disadvantages:

*   **Upsides**: Australia's car-making industry benefited from being part of larger, [[the_impact_of_globalization_and_manufacturing_shifts | globalized networks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. For example, Australian-made auto components could be produced at scale and exported for use in other vehicles globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Downsides**: Profits flowed to Japanese or American headquarters, meaning the Australian government could not fully consider them "Australian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Furthermore, overseas executives lacked emotional attachment to Australia, making core decisions based primarily on the bottom line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This meant Australia did not control its own automaking destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This "worst of both worlds" scenario eventually became a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Loss of Competitiveness and Market Shifts

By the early 1970s, the domestic automotive industry employed over 100,000 people, with GM Holden and Ford as market leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. However, the 1970s marked a substantial loss of [[global_competitiveness_in_regional_jet_manufacturing | competitiveness]] for the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>:
*   Too many models: Five companies produced as many as 15 models, with individual production runs as small as 25,000 units, leading to a lack of economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   Misaligned products: While Australian cars were treasured for their rural ruggedness, the majority of the population lived in cities, creating market gaps, particularly in the small car segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

These gaps allowed high-quality, low-cost Japanese imports, such as the Datsun (Nissan), to gain a significant foothold in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Despite tariffs, Datsun sales grew rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Government Reforms and Industry Response

The 1972 election of the Whitlam government, the first Labor Party government in 32 years, ushered in substantial reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This administration was less favorable towards foreign multinational carmakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Amid concerns about rising inflation, the government strengthened the Australian currency and sought to reduce trade barriers, believing a more liberal trade policy would provide a "competitive jolt" to the domestic industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

A controversial 25% reduction in all tariffs on imported goods in 1973 was met with strong opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. European assemblers and American-Australian carmakers saw the potential entry of Japanese companies as a betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. GM Holden responded by firing 5,000 workers, sparking a political crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

The OPEC oil embargo and the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973 further impacted the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Soaring oil prices spurred sales of small, fuel-efficient Japanese cars, which came to dominate the market segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. While sales of large six-cylinder cars (the domain of Australian carmakers) remained flat, their market share collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

Interestingly, not all Japanese vehicles were wholesale imports. To avoid tariffs, two major Japanese automakers, Toyota and Nissan, established domestic Australian assembly operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Nissan Motors, for instance, signed a contract with a local assembler in Clayton, Victoria, eventually purchasing the facility to make it a regional headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. These operations brought Japanese companies into contact with Australian labor policies, navigating relationships with multiple trade unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

As the six-cylinder market declined, thousands of jobs were lost throughout the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. British Motors Leyland, facing trouble back home, closed its Australian operations in 1975, cutting 2,600 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. The worsening economic situation forced the government to reimpose import quotas in 1974-1975, which only somewhat stemmed the decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

The collapse of automobile exports, from 60,000 units in 1970 to a few hundred by 1979, signaled to government officials that the domestic car industry was uncompetitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### The Button Plan

The mid-1980s brought a new government and major macroeconomic policy changes, including banking sector deregulation, financial market liberalization, and floating the Australian dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The intention was to reorient domestic manufacturing industries towards exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Prime Minister Hawke argued that tariffs had created "inefficient industries that could not compete overseas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. In late 1983, Senator John Button introduced a "new car plan" that offered credits and subsidies for Australian-made cars, along with temporary government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. However, it also significantly reduced import tariffs from 57.5% to 45% by 1988, with further reductions planned until 2000, and removed import quotas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

The plan aimed to slim down the domestic industry into a "leaner, meaner entity," but the shrinking part went as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Ford lost $60 million in 1992 and laid off thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. The 1980s and 1990s saw plant closures by all domestic automakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Unexpectedly, Australian-made cars became even less competitive, as domestic carmakers responded by cutting costs and reducing investment in R&D and manufacturing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

Ultimately, foreign companies had entered the Australian market primarily to bypass trade protections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. When these protections vanished, the multinationals in Japan and the United States saw little reason to maintain their expensive manufacturing operations in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

## The Final Years: Decline and Exit

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, domestic assembly stabilized around 350,000 units annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. However, as the country's economy and population grew, the domestic makers' share of the overall market continued to shrink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This occurred despite AUD 500 million in annual government support through schemes like the Automotive Competitive and Investment Scheme (ACIS), which cost the Australian government AUD 7 billion from 2001 to 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

A decadelong mining boom starting in 2000, fueled by countries like China and India, caused a dramatic appreciation of the Australian dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. The dollar doubled in value from 50 cents USD in 2001 to parity by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. While a strong currency might seem positive, it dramatically increased the cost of Australian automotive production, leading to chronic losses for the entire sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. From 2003 to 2010, the industry lost 25,000 jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

In April 2004, Mitsubishi announced the closure of its engine and assembly plants in Southern Adelaide, resulting in 1,167 job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. The Mitsubishi factory had been an institution since the 1960s, with manufacturing making up 18% of employment in Southern Adelaide in 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Although the federal and state governments provided financial assistance, it was insufficient to save the plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. By 2005, each domestically produced Mitsubishi car was already receiving AUD 1,300 in subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. The Mitsubishi closure in 2006 is often seen as the beginning of the end for the Australian automotive industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

The Global Financial Crisis prompted further government interventions, including targeted subsidies like the Green Car Innovation Fund and the Automotive Transformation Scheme, and a AUD 200 million line of credit to GM Holden after GM filed for bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

In 2013, a new conservative-leaning government under Prime Minister Tony Abbott replaced the Labor Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. This government disagreed with previous interventions, stating that "the government's role is not to prop up private business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. The argument was that all Australian manufacturing was struggling, so cars should not receive preferential treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

By this time, the Australian automobile manufacturing industry was a shadow of its former self. Modern car manufacturers aim for around 250,000 cars per factory per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>:
*   GM Holden produced 160,000 in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.
*   Mitsubishi struggled to produce 35,000 in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.
*   Ford produced about 70,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

Australian labor was also expensive compared to emerging low-cost manufacturers in China and Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. Despite some cooperation between GM Holden and the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union near the end, it wasn't enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

Ultimately, continuous government support was critical for the Australian car-making industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. With billions in subsidies having yielded little, and facing economic crisis, the new government's stance solidified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Finance Minister Joe Hockey's dismissal of GM's approaches ("either you're here or you're not") and the constant delays in new government policies created an unstable environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. Faced with this uncertainty, Toyota and GM pulled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

## Consequences of the Industry's Demise

The loss of Australia's domestic auto industry has wide-ranging consequences:

*   **Impact on the Domestic Components Industry**: 260 Australian businesses supplied the automotive sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>. Without the domestic assembly industry as an anchor, many could not achieve sufficient economies of scale and closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>. For instance, 70% of the Toyota Camry's parts were once made in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.
*   **Vanishing R&D Spend**: In its final years, Australian companies in the automotive industry spent AUD 700 million on R&D, making up 2% of the country's total R&D spending, which subsequently vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.
*   **Job Losses**: Around 14,000 people lost their jobs after the Toyota and GM Holden factories closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. A survey two years later found that less than half were still working, a quarter were seeking new work, and the rest had retired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.
*   **Cultural Impact**: The industry's demise closed a uniquely Australian chapter of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. Despite foreign ownership, Australian cars, particularly rugged vehicles like the Holden Ute, helped mythologize the pioneering spirit and the idea of thriving in the harsh outback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.

## Conclusion

There are no clear heroes or villains in the story of the Australian auto industry's decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. Australia faces challenges such as its remote location and higher costs of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. While the government poured billions into the industry, the underlying economics and lack of economies of scale were significant hurdles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

Some argue that more direct government intervention, akin to Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) arranging mergers to create national champions in the 1960s, might have saved the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. However, Australia opted for a path influenced by rationalism and a deregulated market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

Despite the industry's end, there is a future: Toyota and other automakers continue to tap Australia's educated labor for new automotive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. The former Toyota Altona factory is being converted into a transport hub for green hydrogen technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.

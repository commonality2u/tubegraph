The world of computer chips is defined by various instruction set architectures (ISAs), which serve as the fundamental blueprints for CPU design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Three prominent ISAs are x86, ARM, and RISC-V, each with distinct characteristics and applications. Different companies can share instruction sets but still produce radically different designs and performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## x86 Architecture

x86 refers to a family of instruction set architectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
The two major companies that make and sell chips using the x86 instruction set are Intel and AMD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Intel first developed and popularized x86, but licensed it to other companies for second-source and anti-competitive reasons, with AMD being the most famous licensee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Even with the same instruction set, Intel's and AMD's x86 implementations are different and perform distinctively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

### Dominance and Use Cases
As of today, most CPUs for personal computers, game consoles, and servers are x86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. These chips have a reputation for handling compute-intensive tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a> and drive 481 of the world's top 500 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

### China's Perspective on x86
x86 is seen as a shining example of American technology that has become a global standard, which is a concern for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. China has a strong interest in developing [[chinas_interest_in_homegrown_x86_processors | domestic alternatives]] to American technologies, including x86 chips, due to factors like:
*   **Edward Snowden revelations**: Concerns about American spying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Increased competition**: Growing tension between the U.S. and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **National champions**: Desire for homegrown national champions in critical industries like computer chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.
*   **U.S. restrictions**: The Trump administration's move to cut off companies like Huawei from American technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

## ARM Architecture

Unlike x86, ARM (the company) operates on a different paradigm, focusing on licensing its intellectual property (IP) to other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. These companies then create and sell their own chips for use in devices, commonly smartphones and IoT gadgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. Similar to x86, different ARM implementations yield different performance; for instance, Apple's self-developed ARM chips perform differently from other chips using the ARM instruction set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

### Growing Influence
ARM is increasingly making headway in areas once considered the exclusive domain of x86, including desktops and servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. In China, ARM is particularly popular, with an estimated 95% of computer chips designed there being ARM-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.

## RISC-V Architecture

RISC-V is a newer, open-source instruction set development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>. It is backed by major players such as Alibaba Cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. In China, if a chip isn't ARM-based, it's often RISC-V, with companies like HiSilicon releasing chips based on this architecture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

## Overall Outlook

While x86 still holds a strong position in the tech community, especially for high-performance computing, ARM is gaining significant ground in various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. RISC-V is emerging as a viable open-source alternative.

For China, specifically, x86 development remains a niche industry within its indigenous semiconductor efforts, primarily for domestic consumption due to potential litigation and lack of export competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. Chinese chips based on x86, such as those from Zhaoxin, still lag many years behind their American-made competitors in performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.

The future of these architectures will continue to evolve, with increasing competition and diversification of chip designs and applications.

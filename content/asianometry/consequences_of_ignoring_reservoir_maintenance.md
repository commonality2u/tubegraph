Ignoring the persistent problem of reservoir siltation leads to significant long-term consequences for water infrastructure and the services they provide. When reservoirs are not adequately maintained, their capacity steadily erodes, leading to a host of detrimental outcomes.

## Decline in Reservoir Capacity
Each year, the world loses one to two percent of its [[impact_of_reservoir_silting_on_hydropower_and_water_storage | hydropower capacity]] due to river silt and sediment [00:00:02]. Siltation, also known as [[effects_of_silt_and_sediment_on_reservoirs | reservoir sedimentation]], slowly erodes a dam's capacity to store drinking water, generate power, and protect from flooding [00:00:08]. The storage lost to silting is referred to as "dead storage" [00:01:52]. This necessitates expensive preventive measures and interventions [00:00:13].

## Broader Impacts of Siltation
The [[effects_of_silt_and_sediment_on_reservoirs | effects of silt and sediment]] extend beyond capacity reduction:
*   **Navigation Issues** A silted reservoir impedes boat traffic, making it harder to transport cargo and preventing vessels from reaching dam locks [00:04:04].
*   **Environmental and Health Hazards** When accumulated sediment dries up, it can be carried by wind, causing dust storms and posing health risks to local residents [00:04:12].
*   **Damage to Hydropower Infrastructure** Sediment negatively impacts [[impact_of_reservoir_silting_on_hydropower_and_water_storage | energy generation in hydropower dams]] in several ways [00:04:19]:
    *   Coarse sediments erode turbine runner blades [00:04:25].
    *   They abrade gate seals and spillways [00:04:27].
    *   They can clog intake valves [00:04:29].

### Case Studies
*   **Dominican Republic (Valdezia Dam)** In 1979, during Hurricane David, 17 meters of sediment and debris blocked the Valdezia Dam. Its power intakes remained blocked for half a year, and dredging efforts continued for 28 years [00:04:32].
*   **Australia** Between 1890 and 1960, over 20 dams in Australia became fully silted [00:03:20]. Many of these were older railway dams, but some continue to serve as irrigation or emergency water storage for cities [00:03:26]. These dams were often ill-equipped to manage the massive influx of muddy floodwaters, especially during large floods following droughts [00:03:40].
*   **Syria (Harbaka Dam)** An 1,800-year-old Roman-built Harbaka Dam in Syria is an example of an abandoned, silted reservoir, illustrating how societies can forget or lose the ability to maintain crucial infrastructure [00:13:24].

## Dams as Critical Infrastructure
Historically, reservoirs were designed with a presumed working life, often around a hundred years, after which they were expected to be lost to siltation [00:04:49]. However, many dams are a critical piece of [[impact_of_infrastructure_on_water_resources | infrastructure]], and abandoning them is not feasible [00:05:00]. Like any human-built structure, dams require continuous effort to maintain their effectiveness and cannot simply be built and left unattended [00:13:38].

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

The operation of data centers, especially with the current AI boom, demands significant resources, not just energy, but also water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. A data center with 15 megawatts of IT capacity is estimated to use between 80 to 130 million gallons of water annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This volume is comparable to the water usage of three hospitals or two 18-hole golf courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The massive [[impact_of_data_centers_on_water_and_energy_resources | water footprint]] of these facilities is a growing concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Types of Data Centers

Data centers vary widely in size and function, from small units that fit in a closet to massive custom-built facilities spanning football fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. They are typically classified by floor space, server count, or power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The largest are known as "hyperscale" data centers, housing around 5,000 servers and covering 10,000 square meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. These facilities, often built by global operators like Google or Meta for applications such as Gmail or Facebook, are designed for [[energy_efficiency_in_data_centers | energy efficiency]] and economic scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

[[energy_efficiency_in_data_centers | Energy efficiency]] is measured by Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), calculated by dividing total energy delivered by the energy consumed by ICT equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. A PUE of 1.0 signifies 100% efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Larger data centers generally achieve lower PUEs; Google and Microsoft report PUEs of 1.1 or 1.2 for their hyperscale facilities, whereas a small closet data center might have a PUE of around 2.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The difference in PUE is largely due to superior [[cooling_systems_in_data_centers | cooling systems]] in hyperscale data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Cooling

Nearly all electricity consumed by a data center is converted into heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Even when not at full capacity, data centers draw 60-100% of their maximum power, generating substantial heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Electronic equipment must be kept cool to prevent damage; for instance, hard disk drives require temperatures around 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit), while solid-state chips can tolerate up to 85 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

[[cooling_systems_in_data_centers | Cooling systems]] maintain stable temperatures and humidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The two primary types are air and liquid cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Most data centers use air cooling with a raised-floor system where cold air from Computer Room Air Conditioners (CRACs) is channeled into cold aisles to absorb heat from servers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Hot air rises and is collected for transfer out of the room via fluid heat exchangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

A common system uses two fluid loops:
*   **Process Loop**: A fluid refrigerant (often water and glycol) removes heat from the data room floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Condenser Loop**: Heat is transferred to a water-based loop for final release outdoors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

This two-loop design prevents contamination and offers operational flexibility, though it is more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Cooling towers then cool the water in the condenser loop by evaporation, with about 1% of the water evaporating for every 10 degrees Fahrenheit (5.6 degrees Celsius) of cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This evaporated water must be replaced with new "make-up" water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Energy Usage (Indirect Water Consumption)

The second and often larger source of water consumption for data centers is indirect: the water used to generate the electricity they consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. In 2022, data centers accounted for 1% to 1.3% of global electricity consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Thermoelectric power generation (coal, natural gas, nuclear), which involves boiling water to spin turbines, requires significant water withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. In 2021, 73% of the U.S. power came from thermoelectric means, according to the US Energy Information Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. A Berkeley National Laboratory study found that water usage from energy generation can be 2-3 times greater than the water directly consumed by data center cooling systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. While evaporative cooling towers consume thousands of gallons of water, not using them would necessitate air conditioning systems that consume even more power and, therefore, more indirect water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Water Usage by Major Companies

Several major tech companies report substantial water usage:
*   **Google**: In 2022, Google reported using about 4.3 billion gallons of water for cooling, with 25% sourced from reclaimed wastewater or seawater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Digital Realty**: This real estate investment trust, specializing in data centers, reports that 36% of its water comes from municipal non-drinkable sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Roughly half of their 2022 water consumption occurred in water-stressed areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **AWS**: Their 2022 Sustainability Report indicates that 20 of their global data centers use recycled water for cooling, with 16 in Virginia, 2 in California, and 2 in Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **Microsoft**: Microsoft's 2022 sustainability report highlights commitments to becoming water positive, including funding projects that replenish more water than they consume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Water Sources and Location Concerns

For Google, Digital Realty, Microsoft, and AWS, the majority of water directly withdrawn for cooling is potable water from local municipal supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This presents a challenge as 40-50% of the global population resides in areas facing water scarcity, and data centers often need to be near large population centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

Arizona, a leading state for data center construction (including facilities by Microsoft, PayPal, and Meta), exemplifies this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. While attractive due to ample sunlight, cheap land, business-friendly policies, and low risk of natural disasters, the state frequently experiences drought conditions and relies heavily on the Colorado River for water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Meta has responded by funding water restoration projects in the Colorado and Salt River basins and using long-term storage credits to avoid drawing from municipal water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Water-Saving Cooling Solutions

[[technological_advancements_and_sustainability_in_data_centers | Technological advancements and sustainability in data centers]] are driving new approaches to reduce water consumption.

### Free Cooling

"Free cooling" leverages natural environmental conditions to cool data centers without extensive HVAC systems or large amounts of evaporated water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Direct Free Cooling**: This involves bringing outside air directly into the data center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. However, outside air often contains impurities (smoke, dust, gases) that necessitate dehumidification, filtration, and cleaning, which can offset some energy savings depending on location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Nevertheless, studies in Europe found direct free cooling cuts energy consumption by 5.4-7.9% on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. In Australia, it can save up to 60% in southern capital cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **Waterside Free Cooling**: Data centers located near cold seas can use seawater to cool their systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Google's Hamina data center in Finland, a converted paper mill, uses existing pipes to draw cold seawater, which cools the process loop fluid without mixing, then returns the warmed water to the sea after further cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### Heat Recapture

Another approach is to capture and reuse the waste heat generated by data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This recaptured heat can be used for water [[trends_in_desalination_and_energy_consumption | desalination]], pre-heating water in thermoelectric plants, direct power generation, or district heating for homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Air-cooled data centers produce heat at 35-45 degrees Celsius, suitable for space and water heating, which accounts for about 6% of America's total energy consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. However, heat cannot be efficiently transported over long distances, requiring demand sources to be close to the data center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Furthermore, not all cities have the necessary district heating infrastructure of insulated pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Adopting heat recapture would also likely lead to the adoption of liquid cooling solutions, as liquid is significantly more efficient at capturing and transferring heat than air, reducing overall energy consumption and improving processor performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

### Optimized Temperature Ranges

The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommends a data center temperature range of 15-32 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. While some operators cool even further, raising a data center's temperature by just 1-2 degrees can yield significant financial benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Google's tests indicate their data centers can operate at higher temperatures, though results regarding hard drive performance at cooler temperatures have been contradictory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## Impact of the AI Boom

The ongoing AI boom is driving a rapid increase in data center scale, energy, and water consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Microsoft's 2022 water consumption jumped 34% from 2021, a significant increase from the 13% rise between 2020 and 2021, likely due to ChatGPT and other generative AI products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

Bob Blue, CEO of Dominion Energy, noted a shift from typical data center demands of 30 megawatts to individual requests for 60-90 megawatts or more, and even larger campuses requiring 300 megawatts to several gigawatts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. SemiAnalysis projects that AI will propel data center's share of global energy generation to 4.5% by 2030, with a corresponding increase in water consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. Nvidia's upcoming GPU products are becoming more power-hungry, meaning that training and deploying leading-edge AI models will require immense power and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## Conclusion

The future of compute and AI will demand significantly more electricity and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. This consumption starts at the [[semiconductor_industry_water_usage | semiconductor fabrication]] stage; for instance, TSMC in Taiwan is projected to account for 12.5% of Taiwan's total energy consumption by 2025, partly due to new EUV lithography machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. After chips are produced, they generate heat in data centers that requires even more energy to dissipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

To address these challenges, future data centers will need to rapidly adopt a combination of free-cooling, waste heat recovery, and renewable energy sources like solar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This transition is crucial for both environmental sustainability and financial viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

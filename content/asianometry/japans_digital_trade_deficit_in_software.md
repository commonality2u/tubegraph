From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Japan experienced a digital trade deficit of approximately 5.5 trillion yen (about $37 billion USD) in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This means the country imported trillions more yen in software licenses, cloud services, and other digital services than it exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This deficit is growing, with the 2023 amount being twice that of 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While Japan is globally recognized for its iconic electronics hardware companies like Sony, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Panasonic, Canon, Sharp, and Toshiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, it notably lacks domestic software giants comparable to Microsoft, Oracle, Adobe, or SAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Beginnings of the Computer Industry

Throughout the 20th century, [[mitis_role_in_japans_computer_and_software_industry_development | MITI]] (Japan's economic policy ministry) aimed to develop its computer industry, viewing IBM as a significant competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. IBM first entered Japan in 1925 and established IBM Japan in 1937, though its assets were confiscated during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Upon its return in 1949, a new Japanese law mandated joint ventures (JVs) for foreign computer companies, essentially forcing technology transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Examples include RCA with Hitachi, GE with Toshiba, and Honeywell with NEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, IBM refused to create JVs and maintained 100% ownership of IBM Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

[[mitis_role_in_japans_computer_and_software_industry_development | MITI]] and IBM Japan frequently clashed over market introductions, with government officials leveraging import licenses and encouraging customers to buy local products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Despite these pressures, Japanese customers often preferred IBM products due to their clear technical superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Japan Software Company

The introduction of IBM's System/360 in 1964 spurred [[mitis_role_in_japans_computer_and_software_industry_development | MITI]] to sponsor the Super High-Performance Computer Project from 1966 to 1971, aiming to surpass the System/360 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Unlike previous efforts focused solely on hardware, the project recognized the importance of software, given the System/360's software compatibility across its line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

In October 1966, [[mitis_role_in_japans_computer_and_software_industry_development | MITI]] sponsored the Japan Software Company (日本ソフトウェア), a joint venture between Hitachi, NEC, Fujitsu, and the Industrial Bank of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Its goal was to create a "common language" software and universal operating system for all Japanese computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Despite this ambitious goal, [[mitis_role_in_japans_computer_and_software_industry_development | MITI]] only funded 25% of the project's 10 billion yen budget, indicating software was an afterthought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The Japan Software Company ultimately failed in 1972 due to ballooning requirements, lack of outside sales, and loss of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### [[impact_of_ibm_unbundling_on_japanese_software_industry | IBM Unbundling]] and "Little IBMs"

In 1969, facing an American anti-trust lawsuit, IBM unbundled its software and hardware, a significant event in technology history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This change, which assigned a price to previously bundled software, allowed smaller software companies to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. In the United States, this created the modern software industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

In Japan, however, the [[impact_of_ibm_unbundling_on_japanese_software_industry | IBM unbundling]] led Japanese computer makers to set up software subsidiaries and "adopt" IBM's specifications through reverse-engineering, essentially becoming "little IBMs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Fujitsu began selling an "IBM-compatible" mainframe as early as 1971, marketing it as cheaper and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. These companies modified the software for Japanese kanji symbols and customized it for customers' existing business practices, which locked in customers and allowed higher charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This strategy allowed Japanese companies like Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC to survive despite a persistent technological lag against American firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### The IBM Spy Case

This reverse-engineering was technically illegal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. IBM initially did little due to the lack of definitive copyright protections for software until 1976/1978 legislation, and its focus on a titanic anti-trust case until 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Once the anti-trust case was resolved, IBM confronted Japanese companies like Fujitsu and Hitachi in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

Japanese firms argued that System/360 OS was in the public domain, allowing them to use derived software, and that IBM's specifications were a standard not subject to copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. IBM then escalated the issue to the U.S. government, leading to the "IBM Spy Case" in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This sting operation resulted in the arrest of 18 Japanese employees from Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric for stealing technical secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

The case created significant tension, with the U.S. feeling insecure about its global competitiveness and Japan feeling targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Despite the disputes, it was clear Japanese firms copied IBM's work, including errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The settlement required Fujitsu to pay a lump sum and annual licensing fees up to $60 million, and agree to respect IBM's IP rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. These fees severely impacted the competitiveness of Japanese computer makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

In response, [[mitis_role_in_japans_computer_and_software_industry_development | MITI]] proposed amending copyright laws in 1985 to limit software protection from the international standard of 50 years to just 15 years, though this failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This revealed the severity of the "software crisis," as Japanese companies had built their businesses on foreign closed-source software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## Challenges in Japanese Software

Japan faced a significant "software crisis" and a shortage of qualified programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This dependence on software imports meant Japanese tech providers would always rely on foreign companies like IBM or Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

Several factors contributed to this shortage:
*   **Education Gap** Japanese universities lacked enough qualified computer science and software teachers, with many professors trained in other disciplines like math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. They also lagged in adopting the latest computing trends and often lacked English bilingual abilities or overseas experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Unattractive Job Market** Software engineering was not seen as an attractive career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The largest employers were software development arms of larger business families operating under a lifetime employment system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Developers lacked career progression, earned low pay, and typically performed unfulfilling work like customization or maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. In 2010, an Infosys CEO estimated 80% of Japan's software spending went to maintaining existing systems, compared to under 60% in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Lack of Startups** Unlike the U.S., where independent software giants like Adobe, Intuit, Synopsys, Cadence, Lotus, Electronic Arts, Microsoft, and Oracle emerged in the 1980s, Japan saw a lack of software startups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This was attributed to factors like insufficient customer acceptance, limited venture capital, an unwieldy lifetime employment system, and a cultural lack of initiative or risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### BTRON and SIGMA Projects

One perceived issue was the lack of a robust "software environment" or widely accepted platform for Japanese programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **BTRON** In 1984, Dr. Ken Sakamura initiated TRON, a domestic "open" operating system project aimed at breaking the dominance of Microsoft's software and Intel's hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. The Business TRON (BTRON) variant was adopted by PC makers like Matsushita Electric for use in Japanese schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. However, in April 1989, the U.S. Trade Representative office listed BTRON as a potential Japanese trade barrier. Though the mention was later removed, Japanese microprocessor companies, already caught in the [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | U.S.-Japan semiconductor kerfuffle]], withdrew, leading to BTRON's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **SIGMA** In 1985, [[mitis_role_in_japans_computer_and_software_industry_development | MITI]] launched the five-year, 25 billion yen Software Industrialized Generators and Maintenance Aids (SIGMA) project, aiming to drastically improve programmer productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. While it fell short of its grand goals, SIGMA did prompt Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC to transition from IBM platforms to Unix, licensed from AT&T <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. However, in classic Japanese and Unix fashion, they heavily customized it into proprietary versions like UTS/M, Super-UX, and Hi-UX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This gave them a "second wind" in mainframes and supercomputers, with Japan producing some of the world's fastest supercomputers in the 1990s, challenging Cray Research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. This success, however, remained niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.

## The 1990s and Beyond

The popping of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1990 led to a prolonged recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Customers could no longer afford expensive software modifications, leading to a slow decline for Japanese mainframe makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. This period also led to a re-evaluation of [[mitis_role_in_japans_computer_and_software_industry_development | MITI]]'s long-standing industrial playbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

Traditionally, [[mitis_role_in_japans_computer_and_software_industry_development | MITI]] would fund domestic champions to reverse-engineer popular products and produce them cheaper for export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. While effective for industrial goods like steel and automobiles, this approach failed for software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Software success relies on widely held standards, networks of applications or users, and consumer familiarity, not just replication economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

### PC-98 and I-Mode

*   **PC-98** Japan famously "wrong-footed" the personal computer market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. For over a decade, NEC dominated the domestic PC market with its PC-98, a hardware-accelerated MS-DOS version with Japanese language support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. However, in the early 1990s, IBM, Microsoft, and Intel introduced a new DOS version with Japanese language support, allowing foreign software and hardware to enter the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This time, the Japanese government and [[mitis_role_in_japans_computer_and_software_industry_development | MITI]] opted for a more globalized approach, leading to the collapse of NEC's overpriced PC-98 monopoly and cementing Microsoft's dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.
*   **I-mode** A similar scenario unfolded with mobile internet. In 1999, Japanese telecom NTT DoCoMo launched "I-mode," a popular 2G web browser service with over 40 million subscribers by 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. NTT tried to export the standard, but it failed to gain traction abroad due to a lack of adoption by handset partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. The opportunity closed with the release of the iPhone and its rich application ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite a large software industry, Japan's software landscape is predominantly characterized by custom-made packages with limited market potential or imported products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. The country's brightest software spot remains gaming, despite ongoing [[challenges_in_japanese_software_talent_and_startups | talent issues]] that have somewhat cleared up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. Japanese software programmers are now considered quite good, and the Ruby language was created by a Japanese developer, though its fame came from the Rails framework developed by a Danish engineer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

The persistent lag of "Japan Inc." in the global software industry has been a subject of discussion across multiple technological eras, with no easy policy solutions apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

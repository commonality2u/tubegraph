From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

In the 1960s, as the Soviet economy faced stagnation, a radical proposal emerged: a single nationwide computer network designed to autonomously gather and process data from factories, dictating production as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This ambitious project, known as [[OGAS and the vision of a Soviet internet | OGAS]], was envisioned as the "nervous system for an entire nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, intended to usher in a technologically advanced future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. However, this vision never materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, largely due to significant [[challenges_in_soviet_computer_production | challenges]] and intense [[bureaucratic infighting in soviet computing | bureaucratic infighting]].

## The Soviet Command Economy and the Need for Reform

For much of its existence, the [[economic_challenges_of_early_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] operated as a command economy, where economic activity was coordinated through state directives, quotas, and commands rather than a free market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Three key state entities were involved: Gosplan (State Planning Commission), Gosnab (State Commission for Materials and Equipment Supplier), and Gosbank (handles accounting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

While the command economy initially saw rapid growth and achievements, particularly in military and aerospace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, it struggled with central planning, leading to immense paperwork, distorted incentives, and frequent miscommunications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Quotas were often met only through "pushers" – fixer-type power centers operating informally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Attempts at reform typically resulted in increased bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## The Dawn of Soviet Cybernetics

Following Stalin's death in 1953, Nikita Khrushchev's leadership (1953-1964) ushered in a new era of reforms, including the normalization and adoption of cybernetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. At the 20th Communist Party Congress in 1956, Khrushchev praised cybernetics as a "major tool of the creation of a communist Society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Previously banned under Stalin due to ideological conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, its legitimization allowed for the growth of computer science and industrial automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

Soviet leaders, seeing computers as a universal problem-solving method, believed they could revitalize the ailing economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This was influenced by news in 1958 of America's SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) air defense system, which coordinated radar data using the largest computer ever built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. In response, the Soviets developed their own military computer networks, like System A, which integrated supercomputers for air defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This military success opened eyes to the potential of networked computers for civilian use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Kitov's Early Vision and Downfall

Anatoli Kitov, an early cybernetics pioneer, first proposed networking the nation in 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Having authored the first significant positive article on cybernetics in the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, he proposed that computers could replace manual tabulating machines for economic data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

In January 1959, Kitov wrote to the Communist Party Central Committee, urging the adoption of computers for economic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. He likely also proposed a "unified State network of computing centers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. While the government supported general computer adoption, they initially rejected the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

Buoyed by partial success, Kitov pushed further in Autumn 1959, proposing "Automated Systems of Management" (ASUs) at factories and government agencies, linked together into an "economic automatic management system" (EASU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This system would be run by military computers in underground centers, accessible via civilian terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Kitov saw this as a way to maximize the command economy's centralization advantages and replace bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

However, his "red letter" also criticized the Ministry of Defense's slow computer adoption and suggested sharing military technology with civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. This angered the military, who "will never occupy itself with fulfilling any tasks concerned with the national economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Kitov suffered a show trial, losing his job, Party membership, and military honors, though he continued advocating for a networked Soviet future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:11:09]</a>.

### Glushkov's Ambitious OGAS Proposal

Despite Kitov's setback, others, inspired by Western developments like GE's time-sharing services and American Airlines' SABRE system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, continued to develop networking concepts. Victor Glushkov, head of the Kiev Institute of Cybernetics, sought to create the ASUs Kitov had described, even hiring Kitov as a consultant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:12:02]</a>.

In late 1962, Glushkov wrote to Khrushchev, emphasizing the growing [[soviet_versus_western_computing_capabilities | technology gap]] with the West and calling for accelerated Soviet computerization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:21]</a>. This led to approval for research into economic reform via automated computer networks (ASUs) in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:30]</a>. Glushkov's team successfully demonstrated computer control of distant factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:14]</a>.

From this work emerged [[OGAS and the vision of a Soviet internet | OGAS]] (All-State Automated System for the Management of the Economy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:29]</a>. As originally conceived in the early 1960s, OGAS was highly ambitious:
*   **Three-Tier Hierarchy**: 20,000 computer terminals/ASUs at the first tier, 100-200 mid-level regional systems at the second, and a central planner in Moscow at the third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:14:03]</a>.
*   **Moneyless System**: Initial proposals even included a moneyless system of receipts over the network, though this was later dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   **Economic Nervous System**: The core vision was a single computer network that would "rationally and automatically plan, optimize and produce the country's National economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:48]</a>. This system would dictate daily tasks for bureaucrats, resembling a "nervous system" connecting the "brain" (Soviet leadership) to the "body" (factories and workers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:25]</a>. It was intended as a Soviet counterpoint to the Western market economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:38]</a>.

### Obstacles to Implementation (1964)

The initial [[OGAS and the vision of a Soviet internet | OGAS]] proposal, presented in 1964, faced insurmountable obstacles:

*   **Prohibitive Cost**: The estimated cost was a "stupefying" 160 billion rubles (1.4 trillion USD in 2016), more than the Soviet space and atomic bomb programs combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Technological Immaturity**: While military computers had "World leading capabilities," civilian [[soviet_versus_western_computing_capabilities | computer technology]] lagged significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:37]</a>. The military was also "very unwilling to transfer any of that over to civilians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:43]</a>.
*   **Bureaucratic Resistance and Threat to Power**: Various power centers objected to being replaced or dictated to by computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:57]</a>.
    *   Communist Party bureaucrats, Gosplan, and industrial managers feared loss of authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:17:03]</a>.
    *   The Central Statistical Administration, in particular, recognized that the system's "objective collection of data" would "restrain their own power to control the flow of information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:15]</a>.
*   **"All or Nothing" Approach**: Glushkov's plans were designed to be implemented in their entirety, requiring a "complete Reformation of the country's management system – a revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:28]</a>.

## Brezhnev Era and the Revised OGAS

In 1964, Khrushchev lost power, replaced by Leonid Brezhnev, who largely reversed his predecessor's economic reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:44]</a>. However, thanks to high-level backing from figures like Premier Alexei Kosygin, the idea of computer-driven economic restructuring remained on the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:56]</a>. Gosplan and the Central Statistical Administration, however, continued to reject the project's "utopian Vision," engaging in [[bureaucratic infighting in soviet computing | infighting]] to control its resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:18:06]</a>.

The widespread news of [[comparison_between_soviet_networking_ambitions_and_western_advancements_like_arpanet | ARPANET]] going online in 1969 caught the Soviet leadership by surprise, injecting a competitive urgency into the [[OGAS and the vision of a Soviet internet | OGAS]] project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:39]</a>. In response, Glushkov revised [[OGAS and the vision of a Soviet internet | OGAS]] to be a "universal information Bank" that would "organize and control the flows of data," like a system of canals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:19:03]</a>, rather than controlling the entire economy directly.

### The Final Blow: Ministerial Resistance

At a momentous Politburo meeting on October 1st, 1970, Glushkov presented his new [[OGAS and the vision of a Soviet internet | OGAS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:16]</a>. Initially, several higher-ups spoke positively, and even hardliners did not object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:31]</a>.

However, Vasily Garbuzov, the Minister of Finance, intervened. Recognizing the immense political gravity of [[OGAS and the vision of a Soviet internet | OGAS]] and its potential to erode his ministry's power, he dismissed it as a "silly project good enough only to make hens lay more eggs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:55]</a>. He proposed a far more conservative counter-proposal, which won over the Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:20:04]</a>.

Ultimately, the full [[OGAS and the vision of a Soviet internet | OGAS]] proposal was neither fully accepted nor fully rejected, a "worst type of existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:13]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Unfulfilled Vision

Throughout the 1970s, some ASUs were built in individual factories, numbering perhaps hundreds or thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:30]</a>. However, they were built haphazardly and without standardization, making a nationwide unified network impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:41]</a>.

The proximate cause for the failure of the [[OGAS and the vision of a Soviet internet | Soviet internet]] was [[bureaucratic infighting in soviet computing | bureaucratic infighting]] and various power centers hijacking the project for their own needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:54]</a>. But the deeper reason was that the project "challenged how the Soviet Union ran things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:21:01]</a>. An invention cannot be separated from its context, and the Soviet system itself was only a couple of decades away from implosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:09]</a>.

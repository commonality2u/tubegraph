[[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography]] has become a commercial reality after over 20 years of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Multi-million dollar machines from [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] utilize [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] light to create minuscule patterns on wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A crucial component of [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]]'s $150 million lithography machine is its powerful [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] light source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This article focuses on the advancements in generating the 13.5 nanometer wavelength light necessary for modern microprocessors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

This video primarily examines the [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] approach taken by Kymer, an [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] subsidiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Another company, Gigaphoton (a subsidiary of Komatsu), is also developing its own unique approach to reliably generate [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | UV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Initial Requirements for [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] Light Sources

Engineers identified two major requirements for the next generation of [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] light sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>:

1.  **High Conversion Efficiency**: The source must generate enough [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] light at the correct 13.5 nanometer wavelength, emitted in the right direction towards the light collector optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This needs to be done relatively efficiently without consuming excessive energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
2.  **Debris Mitigation**: Firing lasers creates debris that can contaminate the critical optic system, degrading performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. A method to mitigate this debris was essential for cost-of-ownership requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

These issues, though simple to explain, proved incredibly difficult to overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

## Evolution from Synchrotron to Laser-Produced Plasma

Early experiments in [[japans_semiconductor_industry_and_euv | Japan]] and at Bell Labs in the late 1980s and early 1990s used synchrotron radiation to print patterns as small as 50 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. However, synchrotron sources were not practical for industrial use because they emitted [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | UV]] light over too broad a field of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>, failing the first requirement for directional light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

As [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] was pushed to smaller nodes (from 100nm to 70nm and then 50nm) due to delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>, the demands on the light source increased. Carl Zeiss, the German optics maker, had to add more mirrors to the [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] optics system to increase print resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. Each mirror, even when perfectly made, reflects only about 70% of the [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. This meant [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] needed a much stronger, more brilliant point of plasma light, capable of at least 250 watts, to be competitive with existing [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | 193 nanometer]] laser technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

Researchers began experimenting with Laser-Produced Plasma (LPP), where a laser fires at a target to create plasma that emits [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | UV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. The primary concern was debris contaminating optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

### Target Material Debate: Xenon vs. Tin

Researchers narrowed down target materials to lithium, tin, and xenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.
*   **Xenon**: Initially promising, experiments involved firing kilowatt YAG lasers at a jet of xenon at 10,000 cycles per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. While xenon ice particles could be suppressed from reaching optics using a gas jet, the plasma emitted high-energy ions that still degraded the optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. By 2002, the industry concluded that xenon had a fundamental roadblock: its conversion efficiency was too low, less than one percent, limiting it to only several tens of watts of [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.
*   **Tin**: Tin plasma emits a lot of [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | UV]] light at the required wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. However, firing lasers at a tin plate resulted in terrible conversion efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. Moreover, tin notoriously generates a lot of debris; a mere 1.2 nanometer thick tin layer can cause a 20% decline in collector efficiency and a 10% decline in total tool output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. Despite these issues, the industry decided to pursue tin plasma, believing the debris challenge could be overcome with engineering, as there was no fundamental physics issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

## Breakthrough: Two-Shot Laser System with Tin Droplets

The low conversion efficiency of tin plates was due to low spectral efficiencyâ€”the ratio of 13.5 nanometer light generated compared to the energy input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. Plasma from a tin plate was too opaque, blocking the desired light from reaching the mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

The solution came from firing lasers at **tin droplets** instead of plates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. This allowed for:
1.  **Improved Spectral Efficiency**: A new, more concave target shape was proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
2.  **Reduced Debris**: Making the target as small as possible significantly reduced debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.

The ingenious solution involved a **two-shot laser system** hitting a falling tin droplet 100,000 times a second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>:

*   **First Shot (Pre-pulse)**: A low-energy laser pulse creates strong pressure waves that reshape the spherical tin droplet into a concave sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. This pre-pulse must hit precisely, or it can misdirect the second shot or reflect it back, damaging the laser machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.
*   **Second Shot (Main Pulse)**: A more powerful blast from an amplified carbon dioxide laser (10 micrometer wavelength) further reshapes the droplet into an acorn shape and vaporizes it, creating dense plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>. This plasma then emits the desired 13.5 nanometer [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. This plasma is hotter and denser than lightning-created plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.

The introduction of the pre-pulse in 2016, combined with more powerful CO2 lasers, enabled [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] and Kymer to drastically scale up their [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] light source power levels from 10 watts to over 200 watts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

## System Components and Achieved Efficiency

The [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] machine comprises several main components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[00:12:48]</a>:
*   **High-powered CO2 laser**: Includes a master oscillator and power amplifier (MOPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[00:12:54]</a>. This laser needs to reach over 20 kilowatts of power and is often installed beneath the fab clean room floor due to its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[00:13:28]</a>.
*   **Beam Transport System**: Manages laser focusing and positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Vacuum Vessel**: Filled with low-pressure hydrogen gas, it houses the droplet generator, metrology modules, and the [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] collector mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Droplet Generator**: Shoots 30 micrometer wide tin droplets into the vessel at 50,000 cycles per second (50 kilohertz) at a speed of 80 meters per second (288 kilometers per hour) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[00:13:40]</a>. This high speed ensures sufficient separation between droplets to prevent interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   **[[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] Collector Mirror**: An ellipsoid-shaped mirror with a hole for the laser, it collects the generated light and directs it to the optics system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[00:13:18]</a>.

The combination of these elements yields a final conversion efficiency of **six percent** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[00:14:18]</a>. This massive leap from the initial one percent achieved with YAG lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[00:14:22]</a> allowed [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]]'s [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] machines to consistently reach the 250-watt power level needed to achieve the target of 125 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[00:14:29]</a>. There is even a pathway to 450 watts in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[00:14:41]</a>.

### Debris Mitigation with Hydrogen Gas
To protect the collector optics from over 100 billion pulses and the threat of tin debris particles, high-energy ions, and neutrals from the plasma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[00:14:45]</a>, Zeiss and [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] adopted pumping **hydrogen gas** into the vacuum chamber as a buffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[00:15:05]</a>. The hydrogen gas cools the plasma, blocks a percentage of tin ions, and etches tin layers from the mirror surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[00:15:11]</a>.

## The Role of Scientific Understanding
The development of [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] stands in contrast to earlier lithography technologies like the [[euv_and_duv_technologies_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | 193 nanometer]] argon fluoride lasers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[00:16:00]</a>. For the latter, basic technologies were already developed, and the industry largely relied on trial and error to find what worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[00:16:06]</a>. With [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]], such empirical methods were insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[00:16:21]</a>.

Instead, a deep understanding of physics and fundamental dynamics was required to address the complex energy efficiency and debris mitigation issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[00:16:26]</a>. Scientists first calculated the exact opacity, temperature, droplet size, ion density, and emission duration years in advance, and then built a machine to achieve these specifications in real life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[00:16:40]</a>, akin to a "modern day moon landing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[00:16:51]</a>.

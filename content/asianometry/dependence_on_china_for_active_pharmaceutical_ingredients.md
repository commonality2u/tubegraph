One significant concern for [[history_of_indias_pharmaceutical_industry | India's pharmaceutical industry]] is its concurrent dependence on China for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. These APIs are the most crucial raw materials required for manufacturing finished drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. For example, acetaminophen is the active ingredient in Tylenol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

## Current Reliance
India currently relies on China for 70% of its active pharmaceutical ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Imports of Chinese active pharmaceutical ingredients, particularly antibiotics, have tripled since 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

## Historical Context and Competitive Pricing
India previously manufactured these ingredients domestically but lost market share in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. This was due to [[impact_of_competition_from_china_and_other_asian_economies_on_hong_kong | Chinese products]] entering the market at prices 40% cheaper than what Indian companies could produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Even with higher Chinese labor costs today, the price gap remains about 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

## Challenges and Geopolitical Factors
This industrial weakness became particularly evident in 2020 when China implemented lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. During this period, Chinese vendors experienced stock shortages for shipments to India and restricted the export of certain ingredients needed for virus medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Furthermore, ongoing geopolitical tensions between China and India pose a real concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

## Path Forward
To address these shortcomings, the Indian industry is encouraged to collaborate with the government to implement new import substitution policies for these active ingredients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

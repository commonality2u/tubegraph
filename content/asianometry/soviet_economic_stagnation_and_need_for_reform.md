From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

By the 1960s, the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet economy]] faced significant stagnation and a desperate need for reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A radical concept emerged: a single, nationwide computer network designed to autonomously gather and process data from all factories, dictating production as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This ambitious project, known as OGAS (the Soviet internet), was envisioned as the "nervous system" for the entire nation, promising a tech-driven future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. However, this vision never came to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Command Economy and Its Challenges

For much of its existence, the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] operated as a command economy, where the state owned all means of production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Economic activity was coordinated through directives, quotas, and commands, rather than a free market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Key state entities included:
*   **Gosplan (State Planning Commission)**: Responsible for writing five-year plans and defining economic inputs, including prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Gosnab (State Commission for Materials and Equipment Supplier)**: Implemented the plan by procuring and supplying goods to factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Gosbank**: Handled accounting and recorded transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

In its [[economic_challenges_of_early_soviet_union | early years the command economy]] initially experienced rapid growth, surpassing many other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Achievements in technology and social spheres, particularly in military and aerospace, garnered significant praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

However, behind this facade, the central planning system frequently struggled to manage quotas and redistribute outputs effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Problems included:
*   Immense paperwork <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>
*   Distorted incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>
*   Frequent miscommunications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>

Many quotas, especially outside the military sector, were met only through informal networks of "pushers"—fixer-type individuals who navigated clogged formal channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Attempts at reform often exacerbated the bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Khrushchev's Reforms and the Rise of Cybernetics

Following Stalin's death in 1953, which ushered in a turbulent new era for the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] and its economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, Nikita [[rise_and_decline_of_soviet_economic_strategies | Khrushchev became leader. His reign from 1953 to 1964 saw a series of reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. One key reform was the normalization and adoption of cybernetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

At the 20th Congress of the [[economic_policies_and_challenges_under_communist_rule | Communist Party]] in 1956, Khrushchev praised cybernetics as "one of the major tools of the creation of a communist Society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. He encouraged the development of computer science and industrial automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Cybernetics, originated by Norbert Wiener in the U.S., had been banned under Stalin due to its assertions about information as a substance and its analogies between brain neurons and electric signals, which challenged established Russian psychological theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

Khrushchev's reversal allowed cybernetics to flourish, growing to encompass various sciences and introducing mathematical methods to life and social sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. The Soviets, much like East Germany with semiconductors, fell under a "technological spell," believing computers could unlock a universal method for problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. They sought to apply these powers to the nation's ailing economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Early Proposals: Anatoli Kitov and the "Red Letter"

In 1958, news of the U.S.'s Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) air defense system—a massive computer network coordinating radar data—alarmed Soviet military planners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This led to Soviet efforts to build their own centralized computer networks for defense, such as System A for air defense, which demonstrated the potential of networked computers for civilian use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

Anatoli Kitov, a pioneer in Soviet cybernetics, proposed the first effort to network the nation in 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. After discovering Norbert Wiener's work, Kitov concluded cybernetics was a valuable tool for the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. He authored the first significant positive article on cybernetics and founded one of the country's first computing centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

In 1956, Kitov wrote a book on how computers could model and regulate the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. In January 1959, he wrote to the [[economic_policies_and_challenges_under_communist_rule | Communist Party]] Central Committee, urging the acceleration of computer adoption for economic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. He proposed uniting several economic planning computer centers into a "Unified State Network of Computing Centers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. While his general proposals for computer adoption were supported, the network idea was initially not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

Buoyed by partial success, Kitov sent another letter in Autumn 1959, proposing installing large computers at local factories and government agencies, linking them into "Automated Systems of Management" (ASUs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. His ultimate vision was a "unified automated management system" serving the entire nation, military and civilian alike, called an "Economic Automatic Management System" (EASU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This system would be run by powerful military computers in underground centers, accessible through civilian terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Kitov saw this as a way to maximize the command economy's centralization advantages and achieve immense financial savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

However, this "red letter" also criticized Ministry of Defense leaders for their slow computer adoption and suggested sharing military technology with civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The military, which "will never occupy itself with fulfilling any tasks concerned with the national economy," did not appreciate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Kitov faced a show trial, losing his job, [[economic_policies_and_challenges_under_communist_rule | Communist Party]] membership, and military honors, though he was not executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. He spent the rest of his life advocating for a networked [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Victor Glushkov and the OGAS Vision

Kitov's setback temporarily stalled networking efforts, but the concept continued to be developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. In 1962, Alexander Kharkevich proposed a national unified communications network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Victor Glushkov, head of the Kiev Institute of Cybernetics, became a prominent figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. He sought to create the ASUs that Kitov had detailed, even hiring Kitov as a consultant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. In late 1962, Glushkov wrote to Khrushchev about the growing technology gap with the West, urging faster [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet computerization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

Concerned about this gap, the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet leadership]] approved research into economic reform using automated computer networks (ASUs) in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. These ASUs allowed mainframe computers to receive factory process information, resembling local network factory automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Glushkov's team studied how systems could automatically measure, receive, and process factory information, even achieving successes like a Kiev computer system controlling a steel-smelting factory 300 miles away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

Glushkov's ambitions extended beyond factory automation, leading to the emergence of OGAS: the "All-State Automated System for the Management of the Economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## The Ambitious Plan for OGAS

As conceived in the early 1960s, OGAS was a hierarchical system with three tiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>:
1.  **Tier 1**: 20,000 computer terminals and ASUs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
2.  **Tier 2**: 100-200 mid-level regional planning decision systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
3.  **Tier 3**: A central planner in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

Glushkov even envisioned computerizing currencies and money flows, initially including a moneyless system of receipts to appeal to Khrushchev's Marxist ideals, though this idea was later dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. The driving vision for OGAS was a single computer network that would rationally and automatically plan, optimize, and produce the country's national economy, as dictated by the [[economic_policies_and_challenges_under_communist_rule | Party Center]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. It was likened to a "nervous system" connecting the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]]'s leadership (brain) with its factories and workers (body), coordinating output and overcoming bureaucratic inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This system would be the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet]] counterpoint to the Western capitalist self-regulating market economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

## Reasons for OGAS's Failure

The original vision for OGAS, first presented in 1964, failed to materialize for several reasons:

1.  **Cost**: The project was estimated to take 30 years and cost an astronomical 160 billion rubles (approximately $1.4 trillion USD in 2016 dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. This was more than both the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet space and atomic bomb programs]] combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
2.  **Technological Lag and Military Secrecy**: While the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet military]] had world-leading computer capabilities (e.g., nationwide networks), civilian computer technology in the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] lagged significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. The military was unwilling to transfer its specialized, custom technology to civilian use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
3.  **Bureaucratic Resistance**: Various officials, including [[economic_policies_and_challenges_under_communist_rule | Communist Party]] bureaucrats, Gosplan, and industrial managers, objected to the idea of being replaced or dictated to by computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. The Central Statistical Administration, in particular, recognized that computers' "objective collection of data" would undermine their power to control information flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
4.  **All-or-Nothing Approach**: Glushkov's plans were an "all or nothing" proposition, requiring a complete reformation of the country's management system—a revolution—to realize its benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

## Brezhnev Era and the Evolution of OGAS

In 1964, Khrushchev lost power and was replaced by Leonid Brezhnev, who reversed many of his predecessor's [[rise_and_decline_of_soviet_economic_strategies | economic reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. However, the directive for economic restructuring via computer remained on the agenda due to high-level backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Gosplan and the Central Statistical Administration rejected OGAS's utopian vision, seeking to control its resources to further their own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Any implementation of OGAS would have to conform to the existing [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet way of doing things]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

In 1969, widespread news of ARPANET, the predecessor to today's internet, caught the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet leadership]] by surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. This competitive factor helped push the OGAS project forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. With ARPANET in mind, Glushkov re-envisioned OGAS as a universal information bank, accumulating and moving data between various national agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. Instead of controlling the entire economy, this new OGAS would organize and control data flow, like a system of canals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

At a momentous meeting on October 1, 1970, Glushkov presented his revised OGAS to the Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Despite positive responses from some higher-ups, including tacit approval from hardliners and support from Premier Alexei Kosygin, the Ministry of Finance, led by Vasili Garbazov, intervened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. Fearing the erosion of his ministry's power, Garbazov dismissed OGAS as a "silly project" and proposed a far more conservative counter-proposal, which won over the Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. Ultimately, the full OGAS proposal was neither fully accepted nor fully rejected, leaving it in a state of limbo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

Throughout the 1970s, some individual ASUs were built in factories—estimates range from around 100 to thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. However, these were built haphazardly and without standardization, making a Nationwide United Network of ASUs impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

## Conclusion

The proximate cause for the failure of the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet internet]] was bureaucratic infighting, with various leaders and power centers objecting to its capabilities and hijacking the project for their own ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. The deeper reason, however, was that Glushkov's vision fundamentally challenged how the [[economic_history_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet Union]] operated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. An invention cannot be separated from its context, and that context was only a couple of decades away from implosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

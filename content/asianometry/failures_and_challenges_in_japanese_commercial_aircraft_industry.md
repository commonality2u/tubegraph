Japan's ambition to re-establish itself in the commercial aircraft manufacturing sector post-World War II has been met with significant challenges, leading to considerable delays and financial losses for flagship projects like the YS-11 and the [[Mitsubishi Regional Jet MRJ development history | Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ)]] / SpaceJet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Historical Context: Post-World War II Setbacks

Before World War II, Japan had a thriving aircraft industry, with companies like [[Zaibatsu and Japanese economy | Mitsubishi]], Hitachi, Fuji, and Kawasaki contributing significantly, primarily at the behest of government policy for military projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. However, this industrial development was halted after Japan lost World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

This imposed delay was critical, causing Japan to fall behind in the generational technology shift from propeller planes to jets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. Furthermore, because the industry previously serviced the government, none of these companies were commercially competitive, lacking experience in selling to airliners domestically or internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

## The NAMC YS-11

Japan's first attempt at building a commercial plane after the war was the NAMC YS-11, a turboprop airliner that first flew in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) encouraged a consortium of Japanese companies to design and build it, aiming to replace Douglas DC-3s on short domestic routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

The YS-11 was produced for a decade, shutting down in 1974, having sold approximately 161 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. Despite the Japanese Self-Defense Forces continuing to fly it for many years, the project ultimately failed, incurring a $600 million loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>. Despite its commercial failure, the YS-11 experience allowed Japan to enter Boeing's supplier network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

## The Mitsubishi Regional Jet (MRJ) / SpaceJet

Decades later, Japanese industry watchers identified an opportunity in the regional jet market, expecting growth before 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. In 2003, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) initiated a five-year, $400 million program to study an indigenous regional jet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. [[Zaibatsu and Japanese economy | Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] was selected to lead the project, exhibiting a concept in 2007 and officially launching the program in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>. This led to the founding of [[Mitsubishi Regional Jet MRJ development history | Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation]], with involvement from Toyota and other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

The MRJ (later rebranded SpaceJet) was Japan's first commercial aircraft project in nearly 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>, with [[Zaibatsu and Japanese economy | Mitsubishi]] itself not having developed a commercial plane since the MC-20 in 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Despite [[Zaibatsu and Japanese economy | Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]]' experience as Japan's largest military supplier and a significant contributor to Boeing (e.g., 35% of a Boeing 787, including main wings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>, the MRJ program faced numerous challenges.

### Development Challenges and Delays

The original 2008 plan targeted a 2013 launch date with a $1.3 billion development budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. However, the program experienced six delays, ballooning the budget to nearly $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

1.  **Design Change and Supply Chain Issues (First Delay):**
    *   Initial design featured wings with a drastic sweep using a significant percentage of carbon-based composite materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.
    *   In September 2009, the design changed, making main wings from aluminum and reducing composite use from 30% to 10-15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.
    *   The reason for this change is unclear but may be due to a lack of slack in the supply chain (Toray's inability to deliver complex composite materials) or design considerations (composites' weakness against high impact forces during regional jet takeoffs/landings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.
    *   This led to a six-month delay, pushing the first flight to Q2 2012 and deliveries to early 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. This was the first of many delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.

2.  **Supply Network Struggles (Second and Third Delays):**
    *   [[Impact of supply chain and design changes on aircraft development | Mitsubishi]] struggled to build its supply network, as aircraft parts are highly precise and often sourced from a small group of suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.
    *   Suppliers faced uncertainty regarding economies of scale, leading to higher costs for [[Mitsubishi Regional Jet MRJ development history | Mitsubishi]] (sometimes double Boeing's price for parts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.
    *   This difficulty in securing parts resulted in a second delay in April 2012, pushing the first flight to Q3 2013 and deliveries to mid-2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.
    *   In August 2013, a third delay was announced due to the need for more time with supply partners, pushing first delivery to mid-2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.

3.  **Certification Challenges (Fourth Delay):**
    *   After the first flight in November 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>, extensive internal flight tests and type certification flights (2,500+ hours, mostly in the US) were required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>.
    *   Reviewing the schedule, [[Mitsubishi Regional Jet MRJ development history | Mitsubishi]] decided a fourth delay was necessary, pushing first deliveries to Q3 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. This critically aligned the MRJ's release with Embraer's E2 series, both using the same engine, eliminating the MRJ's fuel consumption advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>.

4.  **Documentation and Wiring Issues (Fifth Delay):**
    *   Type Certification (TC) tests were challenging due to misinterpretations and a lack of proper documentation, leading engineers to adopt their own approaches, particularly in electric wiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.
    *   Post-TWA Flight 800 (1996) changes to FAA aircraft wiring certifications required stringent compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>. Because the wiring design lacked proper documentation, [[Mitsubishi Regional Jet MRJ development history | Mitsubishi]] could not explain it to regulators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>.
    *   Rather than reworking 23,000 wires individually, the company decided to redo the entire wiring, which was tantamount to a total internal redesign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>.
    *   This pushed delivery dates to mid-2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>. Four of the five delays were attributed to sloppy documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>.

5.  **Scope Clause Rework and Pandemic (Sixth Delay & Program Freezing):**
    *   In June 2019, the MRJ was rebranded as the [[Mitsubishi Regional Jet MRJ development history | Mitsubishi SpaceJet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>. The MRJ70 was reworked into the SpaceJet M100 in response to concerns from major US regional airline customers (e.g., SkyWest), whose unionized pilots operate under "scope clauses" limiting aircraft seat numbers and maximum takeoff weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>.
    *   This rework impacted the delivery schedule, leading to the sixth delay in January 2020, pushing deliveries to 2021 or beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:03:00">[18:03:00]</a>.
    *   Simultaneously, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected global air travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>. In March 2020, a type certification flight was delayed due to lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>.
    *   In May 2020, [[Zaibatsu and Japanese economy | Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] halved its SpaceJet development plan and reduced personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>. By October 2020, all development of the SpaceJet M90 was paused, and 95% of [[Mitsubishi Regional Jet MRJ development history | Mitsubishi Aircraft]] employees were laid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>. The company now maintains certification documentation, awaiting an anticipated air travel recovery in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>.

### Outcome

The [[Mitsubishi Regional Jet MRJ development history | SpaceJet]] program is functionally dead, with a massive loss of experience, talent, and resources due to its liquidation and three-year pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>. Despite some progress from 2003 to 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:25:00">[19:25:00]</a>, Japan's odyssey in commercial aircraft manufacturing highlights the extreme difficulty of building cutting-edge commercial aircraft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>.

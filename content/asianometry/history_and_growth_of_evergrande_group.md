Evergrande Group, originally known as Evergrande Industrial Group, is a sprawling Chinese conglomerate that grew to become China's largest real estate company before facing significant financial challenges in the early 2020s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. By late 2021, the company faced billions of dollars in debt and liabilities, prompting widespread concern about its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Founder: Xu Jiayin (Hui Ka Yan)

The [[leadership_and_management_of_evergrande | founder]] and, until recently, chairman of Evergrande is Xu Jiayin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Early Life and Education
Born in 1958, Xu Jiayin was the son of a farmer and a veteran of the Second Sino-Japanese War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. His mother died of sepsis when he was eight months old due to the family's poverty, which prevented them from seeking medical treatment for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

In 1974, at age 16, Xu graduated high school, but college entrance exams were closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. He started his first business selling building materials on the street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. He then worked a series of rural jobs, including cement factory worker, village security officer, and tractor driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

In 1978, he took the Gaokao (college entrance exam) on his second attempt, ranking third out of 10 million students in Zhaokou City <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This achievement granted him entrance to Wuhan University of Science and Technology, where he graduated with honors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Early Career
After graduation, Xu met and married Yang Huaying, who also came from an impoverished background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. He worked at the Wuyang Iron and Steel Company in Ganan as an assistant director of the heat treatment workshop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. There, he was responsible for over 300 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. He managed with an "iron fist" but also paid attention to his workers' welfare, which contributed to his high profile due to the workshop's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

After 10 years, including seven as a director, Xu left Wuyang Iron and Steel Company after being investigated for selling scrap metal in his downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. He stated he was doing it to clear the floor and earn more money for his workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

He then joined Shenzhen Zhongda Group, a trading company, as a salesperson, quickly rising to office director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Xu proved to be a "go-getter," making an immediate impact by shepherding a steel trading alliance with his former company, Wuyang Iron and Steel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He implemented a double salary system, offering top workers a bonus equal to an entire year's salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

In 1994, Xu pushed Zhongda to enter the real estate market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. With the company's blessing, he moved to Guangzhou with four workers (a driver, cashier, salesman, and handyman) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. There, they developed a real estate project called Du Dao Garden (Pearl Island Garden) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. They rented fancy hotel rooms and posted advertisements to attract customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The company implemented a "low-cost, high-value" design that stood out from the massive luxury units prevalent at the time, making premium real estate accessible to the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. By mid-1997, Pearl Island Garden generated a profit of $31 million for Zhongda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Despite this success, Xu's salary remained just $450 a month, five times what a civil servant earned but far from the value he brought to the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. His request for a raise was rejected by Zhongda's CEO, leading Xu to leave and start his own venture at around 39 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Founding of Evergrande (1997)
In 1997, Xu Jiayin founded Evergrande Industrial Group in Guangzhou as a real estate company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The Chinese name, like the English, means something "endless from the past into the present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. With just eight employees, Xu searched Guangzhou for prime land, competing with established Chinese developers like Vanke, Dali, Wanda, and Country Garden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

His first project was Jinbe Garden, built on the site of an old pesticide plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The 110,000 square meter plot had issues, including factories, lack of urban infrastructure, and serious pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. However, these issues allowed Xu to acquire the plot at an extremely low price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

Evergrande couldn't afford the required 5 million RMB down payment, but convinced the government to allow installment payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The company then borrowed 6 million RMB from a bank; 5 million went to the down payment, and 1 million was used to kick off construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

Jinbe Garden broke ground in June 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. In August 1997, the first round of housing sales opened, selling units at 2,800 RMB per square meter (approx. $40 USD per square foot), which was below cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. It was a sensation, selling out in just two hours, with people lining up day and night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The company made 80 million RMB ($12 million USD) in sales, their "first bucket of gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## [[financial_strategies_and_challenges_faced_by_evergrande | Business Strategy and Rapid Growth]]
Evergrande quickly began development on 13 other projects in Guangzhou simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. By 1999, just two years after its founding, Evergrande was Guangzhou's seventh-largest real estate company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. They rapidly expanded, refining their internal procedures and business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

In 2006, Evergrande embarked on national expansion, deploying 200 employees to Wuhan, Shenyang, Chongqing, and Chengdu with a goal to "recreate 20 Evergrandes in just three years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. At this time, the company had 7.8 billion RMB ($1.2 billion USD) in total assets, with 6.8 billion RMB ($1 billion USD) in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

Xu implemented a consistent business strategy:
*   **Small units** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>
*   **Previously undesirable areas** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>
*   **Price targeted to the middle class** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>
*   **Built extremely quickly** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>

The company built developments in rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. They would sell debt to raise funds for land development rights, then build and sell units to recover initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Most sales from each round were reinvested into more land purchases and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Evergrande's early strategy was summarized by the slogan "San Gao Yidi" (three highs, one low) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>:
*   **High Debt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
*   **High Leverage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
*   **High Turnover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
*   **Low Cost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>

This reliance on high debt was precarious, meaning the company always teetered "on a razor's edge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. However, without this debt, Evergrande could not acquire its massive land bank, which was China's fastest-appreciating asset at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. As long as land prices rose, the company stayed ahead of its debt costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

A significant portion of Evergrande's liabilities came from customer deposits for future homes, unlike a bank's checking accounts, meaning the risk of a forced withdrawal was much higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Furthermore, over 50% of what Evergrande owed was classified as current liabilities, meaning it could be called upon to be repaid within a year or an operating cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

## Financial Crisis and IPO
The 2008 global financial crisis triggered fears of a real estate crisis in China, leaving Evergrande in turbulent waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. At this time, the company was in the midst of its national expansion, spending heavily to acquire valuable land in China's first and second-tier cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Its land bank had grown ninefold since 2006, but with 37 projects underway, Evergrande faced cash flow problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. The company owed about 12 to 15 billion RMB (approximately $2 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

Evergrande's original plan to pay off this debt was to take the company public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. However, the global financial crisis "nixed" this plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Xu Jiayin scrambled for money, first reaching out to his friend Wang of Vanke, who turned him down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

Desperate, Xu turned to Cheng Yu-Tung of Chao Tai Fook Group, one of Hong Kong's richest business families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. The two spent three months having dinner and playing cards, despite a language barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Eventually, Cheng Yu-Tung decided to invest over $150 million USD as a lead investor in a pre-IPO $500 million USD investment round to help bail out Evergrande <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Other investors included Deutsche Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and the Kuwait Investment Authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This investment allowed the company to stabilize and continue its projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

In November 2009, the IPO proceeded in Hong Kong, with shares rising 34% on the first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Xu held a 68% stake in Evergrande, which, at the company's $10 billion USD valuation, pegged his wealth at over $6 billion USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. By the end of 2009, Evergrande had total assets of 63 billion RMB ($9.8 billion USD) and total liabilities of 50 billion RMB ($7.8 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

## [[evergrandes_diversification_and_investment_ventures | Diversification Efforts]]
After the IPO, Xu Jiayin aimed to build an empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **Football Club**: A year after the IPO, Evergrande acquired the Guangzhou Football Club (soccer) for 100 million RMB ($15 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Evergrande stabilized the club, leading to great success, including seven straight Chinese Super League championships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. In 2013, the club won the Asian Champions League title, the first Chinese team to do so in 23 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Consumer Goods (Mineral Water)**: During the Asian Champions League event, Evergrande formally entered the consumer goods industry with its mineral water product, Evergrande Binche (Evergrande Ice Spring) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Marketing claimed the water came from deep mineral springs of Changbai Mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Xu set ambitious sales targets for Ice Spring: 10 billion RMB ($1.5 billion USD) in 2014, and 30 billion RMB ($4.6 billion USD) by 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. However, the brand struggled; despite high gross margins, it was not profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. In 2016, Evergrande sold its shares in the mineral water business and other food products for about 2.7 billion RMB ($405 million USD), which included the unit's 3.3 billion RMB ($510 million USD) in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **Healthcare and Plastic Surgery**: In mid-2014, Xu unveiled a new strategy of "diversity + scale + brand" to diversify operations beyond real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Three months later, Evergrande acquired Yen-Chen Plastic Surgery, a chain of clinics, with Xu's wife, Yan Huaying, placed in charge of operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Other purchases followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.
*   **High-Tech and Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: In 2018, following the US crippling Chinese telecom company ZTE, Xu identified a shift in government priorities and announced Evergrande's entry into the high-tech industry, including quantum computing, AI, life sciences, and new energy vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. After a failed attempt to acquire American EV company Faraday Future, Evergrande decided to go it alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

In November 2019, Evergrande announced a 45 billion RMB ($7 billion USD) investment over three years to develop electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. Instead of founding a new subsidiary, they renamed an existing Hong Kong-listed health company (Evergrande Health Industry Group Limited), which had been a gossip magazine publisher merged with hospital chains and plastic surgery clinics, to Evergrande Auto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

In August 2020, Evergrande Auto unveiled six vehicles under its Hangqi brand (sedans, SUVs, MPVs), with the first model expected to hit the market a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. A month later, the company raised $500 million USD from investors like Tencent, Didi, Sequoia Capital, and Jack Ma's Yunfeng Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>. Evergrande Auto also struck deals with Guanghui Group (China's biggest automobile dealer) for sales networks and State Grid Corporation of China for charging stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. This news, combined with EV euphoria, caused the stock to surge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. By April 2021, Evergrande Auto was valued at nearly $90 billion, more than Ford Motors at the time, despite not having sold a single car and losing billions of RMB annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>. The stock eventually crashed by over 95% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

## [[financial_strategies_and_challenges_faced_by_evergrande | Financial Strategies and Challenges]]
In early 2017, with total liabilities reaching 1.15 trillion RMB ($178 billion USD), Xu Jiayin announced a reversal of the "three highs, one low" strategy to "San Di Yi Gao" (three lows, one high) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>:
*   **Low Debt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>
*   **Low Leverage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>
*   **Low Cost** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>
*   **High Turnover** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>

The goal was to lower debt ratios and raise total net assets, aligning with the [[chinese_governments_response_and_regulations_affecting_evergrande | Chinese government's]] push to de-lever the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Xu also maintained close ties with the government, being China's most generous individual in terms of charity, winning the China Charity Award for eight years in a row and donating billions of RMB annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. These ties were leveraged, for instance, in the successful legal battle against short-selling firm Citron Research in 2012, which had claimed Evergrande was insolvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

The 2017 strategy turnaround led to asset sales, fundraising, and debt reduction measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. Evergrande reported net profits rising 110% to 37 billion RMB ($5.7 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. Although some reports claimed the net debt ratio declined, total liabilities actually rose from 1.1 trillion RMB ($170 billion USD) in 2016 to 1.5 trillion RMB ($232 billion USD) in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>. The company touted itself as China's most profitable real estate company, making the Fortune 500 list for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

### The "Three Red Lines" Policy
In August 2020, after interviewing 12 real estate companies, two Chinese ministries passed regulations known as the "Three Red Lines" to address contagion threats in the financial sector caused by massive conglomerates funded by borrowed money and off-balance sheet arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>. Companies not fulfilling these requirements would not be allowed to add more debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>.

The "Three Red Lines" were:
1.  **Liabilities-to-assets ratio ceiling**: 70% (excluding advances from contracted projects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>
2.  **Net debt-to-equity cap**: 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>
3.  **Cash-to-short-term borrowings ratio**: At least 1:1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>

When the law passed, Evergrande's metrics were far from compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>:
*   Liabilities-to-asset ratio: 82% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>
*   Net debt-to-equity: 199% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>
*   Cash to short-term borrowings: 0.4 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>

This caught Evergrande off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. Weeks later, Xu announced that Evergrande would slash pricing on its 600+ new builds nationwide by 30% to achieve sales of 100 billion RMB ($15.4 billion USD) each month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

## Recent Turmoil and Outlook
In September 2020, a Chinese website leaked a letter allegedly sent by Evergrande to the Guangdong provincial government, titled "Report on Requesting Support for Major Asset Restructuring Projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>. While the company denied its authenticity, the market believed it was real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. The letter emphasized Evergrande's adherence to government policies and detailed its significant interest-bearing liabilities:
*   Total: 835 billion RMB ($130 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>
*   Owed to 128 domestic banks: 232 billion RMB ($35.8 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a> (biggest banks: Minsheng Bank, Agricultural Bank of China) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>
*   Owed to 121 non-banking entities (real estate funds, etc.): 368 billion RMB ($56.9 billion USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>
*   Remainder: Various domestic and offshore bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>

The letter requested the Guangdong government's help coordinating a reorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. It warned that if the reorganization wasn't completed by February 2021, Evergrande would owe strategic investors 130 billion RMB ($20 billion USD) plus 13.7 billion RMB ($2.2 billion USD) in dividends, potentially triggering a sudden cash flow crunch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>.

Following this, Evergrande experienced debt downgrades, with shares dropping over 68% and debt losing over half its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. The company sought new funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.

Evergrande's 2020 annual report showed approximately 1.95 trillion RMB ($300 billion USD) in liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. While it had 1.9 trillion RMB in assets (mostly land bank and houses under construction), these were illiquid without payments to vendors and construction crews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.

Additional concerns arose from Evergrande wealth management fund products, high-yielding interest products primarily sold to employees, who then resold them to friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. Approximately 40 billion RMB ($6.2 billion USD) of these products were outstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>. On September 8, 2021, two affiliates missed repayments, leading to protests at Evergrande's headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>. Five days later, Evergrande announced repayment options including cash (with a wait), payment in kind (land), or credit for future house payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>.

A major issue is the "off-balance sheet" debt from subsidiaries not majority-owned but still representing themselves as Evergrande companies, with their debts implicitly backed by the main group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

Amidst the turmoil, Xu Jiayin resigned as Evergrande's chairman on August 17, 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Zhao Tanglong stepped up as chairman, general manager, and legal representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:30:59]</a>.

As of the video's publication, the situation is ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. The government is not expected to bail out Evergrande, which is likely to undergo court-ordered debt resolution and be slowly broken up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. Concerns remain about the impact on hundreds of new builds and real estate markets across China, but lower real estate prices might align with the government's social equality goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. The key question is whether regulators can fence off the damage from off-balance sheet issues to prevent a systemic crisis of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>. Regulators have successfully handled similar crises with other massive conglomerates, such as Anbang Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

In 2019, [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]] successfully shipped its first high-volume Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) system, marking the completion of a multi-decade journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This achievement signified a significant shift in the semiconductor lithography industry from Asia towards Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## [[asmls_rise_in_the_lithography_industry | ASML's Rise and Early Involvement]]

EUV was initially one of several potential next-generation lithography candidates being explored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. While Japanese companies, who had previously led the lithography industry, initially preferred proximity x-ray, [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]] eventually emerged as the dominant force in EUV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Following the conclusion of the American EUV LLC project in 2003, [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]] took over from the American company Silicon Valley Group Lithography to continue the commercialization efforts for [[challenges_in_developing_commercial_euv_systems | commercial-ready EUV lithography]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## [[asmls_future_technological_developments | Key Technological Choices]]

One of the critical choices for EUV development was the light source. [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]] ultimately chose the laser-produced plasma (LPP) approach to generate EUV light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Although [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]] also experimented with the discharge-produced plasma (DPP) approach, they eventually halted all work on it by 2013, as sufficient power levels were not achieved until they pioneered their laser double shot method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

## [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | Milestones and Competitive Advantage]]

By 2005, [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]] was in the final stages of developing its Alpha demo tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Two such tools were delivered in August 2006 to the Belgian Research Institute imec and the State University of New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. This put [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]] approximately one and a half years ahead of its Japanese competitor, Nikon, whose EUV-1 Alpha device went live in January 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

By 2011, it became evident that [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]] had established a substantial lead, stretching from 18 months to as much as two years over its rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>.

## [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | Strategic Partnerships]]

In July 2012, Intel announced an agreement to invest up to $4 billion into [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]] in exchange for a stake of up to 15 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. This investment signaled Intel's decision to move forward with [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]] as its primary EUV lithography vendor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.

## [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML as the Industry Leader]]

With competitors like Nikon eventually curtailing their EUV development efforts, [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]] became the last remaining company standing in the EUV lithography industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. This solidified [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | ASML]]'s position as the sole provider of high-volume EUV systems for advanced semiconductor manufacturing.

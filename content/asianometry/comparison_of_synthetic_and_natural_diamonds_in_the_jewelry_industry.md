Historically, natural diamond prices have shown little correlation with their extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While a diamond might cost between $550 to $20,000 per carat at a jewelry shop, its mining cost is closer to $58 to $60 per carat, a figure that has remained stable for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This significant price difference is primarily due to [[history_of_diamond_pricing_and_supply_control | supply cartels]] that carefully manage supply to maintain high prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The emergence of synthetic, gemstone-quality diamonds has profoundly impacted the jewelry market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Natural Diamond Market Control
For centuries, market entities have controlled diamond supply to manipulate prices upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   **Antiquity in India**: Even when Indian kings dominated production, prices far exceeded extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. In the 1500s, a half-carat diamond could cost the equivalent of 30,000 days of an average laborer's wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **18th Century Brazil**: When diamonds were discovered in Brazil in 1725, a flood of new supply caused prices to drop by 30-50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The Portuguese Crown swiftly seized control of mines and limited supply to stabilize prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **De Beers Cartel**: The most famous cartel, [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control | De Beers]], emerged after large diamond discoveries in South Africa in 1866 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Cecil Rhodes consolidated the South African diamond mining industry by 1888, limiting production to stabilize prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   **Central Selling Organization (CSO)**: Under Ernst Oppenheimer, De Beers established the CSO, which bought raw diamonds at a fixed profit-guaranteed price from producers and resold them in "sites" to jewelers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Site holders were required to accept the entire box of diamonds at a non-negotiable price and could not resell rough diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
    *   **Marketing**: De Beers famously tied diamonds to romance through a 1938 marketing campaign, using influencer marketing, planted news articles, and the slogan "a diamond is forever" (1949) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This transformed diamonds into a symbol of luxury and a wedding fixture, perceived as unique creations of the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Early Attempts and Scientific Roadmaps
The understanding that diamonds are a form of carbon (demonstrated by Smithson Tennant in 1797) led to early attempts to create them by subjecting carbon to high pressure and heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Early claims of success by James Hannay and Ferdinand Frederick Henry Moissan in the late 1800s could not be replicated, as the necessary technology was beyond their era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

A scientific roadmap was established by Gilbert Lewis and Merle Randall in 1915, showing that diamond and graphite were in equilibrium at 10,000 atmospheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This helped map the conditions (temperature and pressure) required for carbon to manifest as a diamond, which included 2,000°C and over a million pounds per square inch of pressure, possibly less with a metal catalyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Initial Industrial Synthesis (High Pressure, High Temperature - HPHT)
*   **ASEA (1953)**: The General Swedish Electrical Limited company (ASEA) produced the first synthetic diamond in February 1953 using a device with six anvils to apply pressure and ignited thermite for heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. They successfully created small diamond crystals (0.1 mm) at 80,000 bar (1.2 million psi) and 2,000°C, aided by an iron solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. ASEA did not immediately publicize or patent their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **General Electric (GE) (1955)**: GE formed a group in 1951 to synthesize diamonds due to supply chain concerns, as they were the world's largest diamond consumer for industrial grit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Modifying a design by P.W. Bridgman, they created a "belt apparatus" capable of 3 million psi at 3,400°C <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. At these extreme conditions, carbon could directly transform into diamond without a solvent, producing small crystals (1 mm wide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

The news of GE's success initially threatened the belief in natural diamonds' uniqueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. However, these early synthetic diamonds were very small and of low quality (dark, onion-like structure), making them more suited for industrial grit than jewelry, allowing [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control | De Beers]] to breathe a sigh of relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Growing larger HPHT diamonds (up to three carats) was possible but resulted in low-quality, dark-colored diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. It wasn't until 1970 that scientists created a large, gem-quality crystal using HPHT, but it took about a week to grow a one-carat diamond, which was economically infeasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. These crystals were also typically yellow and distinguishable from natural diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### [[technological_advancements_in_diamond_synthesis_methods | Technological Advancements in Diamond Synthesis Methods]] (Chemical Vapor Deposition - CVD)
Researchers explored growing diamonds in low-pressure environments without expensive HPHT equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **William Eversole (1952-1953)**: Eversole of Union Carbide experimented with heating carbon-containing gas in the presence of a seed diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Carbon atoms would attach to the diamond surface, adding mass without high pressure – a method known as Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), similar to processes in the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **John Angus (1963)**: Dr. John Angus of Case Western Reserve University replicated Eversole's work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. His team discovered that atomic hydrogen was key to successfully growing pure, gem-quality diamonds with CVD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Atomic hydrogen helped suppress graphite formation (an impurity) and turn any formed graphite into gas, carrying it away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Soviet and Japanese Advancements**: Soviet scientists, intrigued by Angus's use of atomic hydrogen, pioneered its use not only during cleaning but also during the growth phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. In the 1980s, a Japanese team at the National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials used hot filaments or microwaves to activate hydrogen and methane, accelerating growth to a few micrometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

By the 1990s, the CVD industry overcame its limitations, becoming capable of making single-crystal synthetic diamonds in various colors and of gem quality, which soon appeared in the jewelry market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

### Market Response and Future Outlook
In the 1990s, [[challenges_and_strategies_of_de_beers_in_maintaining_market_control | De Beers]] invested in new ways to detect synthetic diamonds using UV fluorescence, X-rays, and spectroscopy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. However, synthetics rapidly eliminated this weakness, reaching a point where identification requires very advanced laboratory tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

Coinciding with these technological advancements, the broader diamond industry underwent massive changes in the 1990s, including the rise of Japan as a luxury market, the fall of the Soviet Union, and new discoveries in Australia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. New competitors like Al Rosa (Russian monopoly) and BHP (with the Argyle mine in Australia) challenged De Beers' cartel control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. By 2000, De Beers restructured into a traditional luxury company, focusing on promoting its own affiliated dealers and partnering with brands like Louis Vuitton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

In a significant shift, De Beers announced in 2020 that it would begin producing and selling its own synthetics, leaning into the [[development_of_synthetic_diamonds_and_their_impact_on_the_market | synthetic diamond industry's technological advances]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This mirrors the market transition of pearls:
*   Pearls were once natural gems harvested from the wild <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   In the 1910s, Japan pioneered cultured pearl farming, and consumers preferred these synthetic pearls for their rounder, better look, and environmental friendliness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   Today, virtually every pearl found in a jewelry shop is cultured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

Modern gem-quality CVD synthetic diamonds offer an "all-around better product" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>:
*   More beautiful and ideal-looking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   Better for the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   Fewer exploited workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   Produced far cheaper than any natural diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

This means the diamond market is breaking not by eliminating value, but by shifting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Where consumers once paid for the scarcity of the natural stone, they may now pay for the scarcity of a luxury brand like De Beers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

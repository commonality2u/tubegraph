In its early years, the Soviet Union attempted to establish a society without money, a policy that proved to be disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Despite the country being severely affected by years of [[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_soviet_economy | war and revolution]], the Bolsheviks aimed to immediately implement their socialist ideal of a moneyless society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Marxist Economic Theory and Bolshevik Policy

The notion of eliminating money was widespread and deeply ingrained among the Bolsheviks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. They never questioned it as a core facet of the economy they desired for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This approach was heavily influenced by Karl Marx's economic theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Marx believed that money contributed to cyclical booms of over and under production in capitalist economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. He described a process where capitalists use money (M) to buy commodities (C) and then resell them for more money (M Prime), only engaging if M Prime is greater than M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. If not, they would hoard money, leading to periodic overproduction crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Secondly, Marx viewed money as the mechanism through which the bourgeoisie exploited the working class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He argued that workers' wages were not commensurate with the value of their output, which generated wealth for capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. In a centrally planned socialist society, Marx believed, money would not be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Economic State of Russia Prior to Bolshevik Control

[[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_soviet_economy | World War One]] significantly impacted the Russian economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
The Imperial government abandoned the gold standard in June 1914, four days after entering the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This led to massive government budget deficits: 39% in the first year and 75% in the two years after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

The war resulted in:
*   Large government budget overruns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   Foreign borrowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   Physical destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   Collapses in economic output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   High rates of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Between 1913 and 1917, the number of industrial workers in Russia fell by 16.4%, and total industrial output declined by 22.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. By early 1917, the amount of paper rubles in circulation had increased to 9 billion, up from 1.6 billion in July 1914, a 5.5-fold increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The Russian government's deficit in 1917 was 82% of its budget, with 73% of that deficit funded by the printing press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

When the Bolsheviks seized power, the economy was already in an inflationary crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Furthermore, the new government lost access to much of the Empire's most productive land:
*   The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (March 1918) ceded a third of Russia's population, nearly a third of its agricultural land, and over half of its industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   The [[economic_impact_of_oil_production_on_the_soviet_economy | oil wells of Baku and the Caucasus]], representing 97% of Russia's total oil output, were inaccessible until late 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   Ukraine, which alone provided 78% of Russia's coal, 74% of its iron ore, and 80% of its grain, was not reliably controlled by the Bolsheviks until 1920 due to the [[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_soviet_economy | Russian Civil War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## War Communism and Economic Transformation

Despite the dire state of the economy and Russia's largely agricultural, semi-industrialized society, the Bolsheviks proceeded with their plan for socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This period, known as [[hyperinflation_and_economic_challenges_during_the_soviet_war_communism | War Communism]], aimed to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat and centralize all economic activities into a single national plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Banking Nationalization
The Bolsheviks considered banking to be at the core of the capitalist system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The *Communist Manifesto* lists the establishment of a single central bank as the first step toward centralizing the means of production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Russia's financial system was already centralized, with 12 banks holding 80% of the country's capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, making nationalization relatively swift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

On November 20, 1917, the People's Commissar of Finance seized the Russian State Bank (Goss Bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Private banks were ordered to fund worker-controlled factories, and upon their refusal, troops occupied the largest banks in December 1917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. By the end of 1918, every bank was liquidated and merged into Goss Bank, which ceased lending and simply kept accounts of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This nationalization cut off credit to the economy, leading to 405 enterprises and 205,000 workers closing down in the first quarter of 1918 due to lack of credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Industry Nationalization
In June 1918, the Council of the People's Commissar announced the nationalization of industry, seen as crucial for the transition to socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Throughout late 1918 and early 1919, the government nationalized railways, shipping, and mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This process was chaotic; less than 14% of nationalizations were managed by the central government, with the majority handled by local organizations and trade unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This led to the expulsion of skilled workers and business owners, whose replacements often lacked the knowledge to run the machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Impact of the Russian Civil War
The Bolsheviks were simultaneously fighting the [[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_soviet_economy | Russian Civil War]] from summer 1918 to late 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The government dedicated every possible effort to supplying the Red Army, utilizing all available labor and resources for the war effort through forced mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

The war and nationalization strained the treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. With no one willing to lend money due to the repudiation of foreign debts and nationalization of assets in 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, the government had no way to fund its expenses without the printing press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Income taxes provided only 7.3% of total budget spending in 1918, forcing the Bolsheviks to raise indirect taxes and implement an extraordinary income tax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### Food Dictatorship and Requisitioning
Food shortages were an early problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. The Tsarist government had introduced a grain monopoly during [[impact_and_consequences_of_the_war | World War One]], prohibiting grain trading and requiring farmers to deliver surpluses to the state at fixed prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. The Bolsheviks reaffirmed this monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. However, the crashing ruble meant wages no longer incentivized peasants, who refused to sell at official prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

The government, viewing the problem as distribution rather than production, responded by "requisitioning" food, which further disincentivized peasants from producing surpluses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. In May 1918, the Bolsheviks announced a "food dictatorship," reaffirming the grain monopoly and permitting the use of armed force to seize food from peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

## Hyperinflation and the Devaluation of Money

Inflation reached 598% at the end of 1918, with over 60 billion rubles in circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The actual value of these rubles, measured against 1913 values, had fallen by a tenth from 1917 to 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

[[hyperinflation_and_economic_challenges_during_the_soviet_war_communism | Hyperinflation]] intensified rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. In May 1919, the People's Bank announced it would print as much money as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Inflation jumped from 598% to 1,376% in 1919 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. The ruble's value crashed so quickly that the government had to publish budgets retroactively, making planning impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Money printing costs consumed 45-60% of the mint's budget in the second half of 1919, and even the War Ministry received less than 40% of its requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

Amazingly, the Bolsheviks argued that this hyperinflation was a sign that their socialist transformation was succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. Their goal in printing unlimited paper money was to devalue it to nothing, thereby annihilating the power of the wealthy, transitioning to a system of state distribution, and creating a moneyless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. However, this also indicated their continued reliance on the old capitalist system to fuel their industrial and war machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

## Consequences of War Communism

By 1921, the Soviet government recognized that [[hyperinflation_and_economic_challenges_during_the_soviet_war_communism | War Communism]] had gone too far, and the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Russian economy]] had collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

### Economic Collapse
The state was unprepared to take centralized control of every item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Illegal markets flourished, providing most of people's food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Production of items like steel, sugar, and bricks practically ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Overall industrial production fell to a third of the pre-war (1913) era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Without money, there was a total lack of incentive to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Worker desertion rates in railways hit 40%, and in 1920, a worker produced only 45% of their pre-war output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

### Social Impact
[[hyperinflation_and_economic_challenges_during_the_soviet_war_communism | Hyperinflation]] ruined the lives of the Russian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. Daily caloric intake in 1919 fell by 30% from the 1910s average (3,820 to 2,680 calories) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. A famine broke out in 1921, lasting into 1922, resulting in the deaths of 5 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Food requisitioning had left peasants with no reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

### Rebellions
Despite the end of the [[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_soviet_economy | Russian Civil War]], peace did not return, and peasants began to revolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The Kronstadt rebellion in 1921 particularly shook Lenin's views on the direction of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

## Shift to the New Economic Policy (NEP)

Lenin realized that market activity had to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. In March 1921, the Bolsheviks implemented the New Economic Policy (NEP) to reverse the decline, grow output, and stabilize the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

By 1923, after an issuance of 176.5 quintillion new rubles, the Soviet government fully reversed course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. They issued a gold-backed currency, made the Central Bank independent, and rebalanced the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. As a result, rebellions calmed down, and output began to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

Lenin reflected on the period, acknowledging, "Life has shown how wrong we were" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a> regarding their initial enthusiasm for direct economic tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. He considered the NEP a real way forward, attributing the mistakes of the [[hyperinflation_and_economic_challenges_during_the_soviet_war_communism | War Communism]] years to the interruptions of the Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

## Conclusion

The state's intention during the [[hyperinflation_and_economic_challenges_during_the_soviet_war_communism | War Communism]] years was to detach the country from capitalism, create a trade monopoly, and eradicate money itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. However, these plans led to chaos, violence, and a crisis-level collapse in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

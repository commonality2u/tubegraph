The primary driver for the renewed interest in [[commercialization_and_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]] is the availability and cost of their raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Comparison with Lithium-ion Battery Raw Materials

### Lithium Availability and Extraction
Almost all of the world's lithium originates from just four countries: Australia, Chile, China, and Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The extraction of lithium is not only difficult but also poses environmental challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Beyond lithium, other critical elements like cobalt, often used in [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]], raise significant environmental and humanitarian concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Concerns regarding the limited supply of raw materials for [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] first emerged in the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, prompting the need for alternative battery chemistries to support a carbon-free economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### Sodium Availability
In stark contrast, the global supply of sodium is virtually limitless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The Earth's crust contains over 1,000 times more sodium than lithium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Cost Implications

### Raw Ingredient Cost
The abundance of sodium translates directly into significantly lower raw ingredient costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Sodium's raw ingredient cost is approximately $150 per ton, compared to lithium's $5,000, representing a 30-fold decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Overall Battery Cost
While the raw materials for [[historical_development_and_challenges_in_sodiumion_battery_technology | sodium-ion batteries]] are substantially cheaper, the overall cost savings for the end-user will not be drastically lower than [[comparison_between_sodiumion_and_lithiumion_batteries | lithium-ion batteries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This is because the engineering and manufacturing processes for both battery types are similar, with significant overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Most of the savings in the final product will stem from the cheaper raw material costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. One study estimates that end-users could see a 10% to 30% price reduction for [[commercialization_and_applications_of_sodiumion_batteries | sodium-ion batteries]], assuming all other factors are equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

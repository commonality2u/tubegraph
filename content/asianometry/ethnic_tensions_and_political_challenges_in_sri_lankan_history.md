Sri Lanka's economic development has been a subject of study for decades, with recent events adding a "bitter new page" to its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The country, once known as Ceylon, gained independence from British colonial rule in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. At independence, Sri Lanka had several advantages: a strategic trading port location, no infrastructure damage from World War II, strong rankings in education and population health, and a democratic political system with universal suffrage that was seen as a model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. It also inherited a highly productive export economy specializing in tea, rubber, and coconuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. In 1950, Sri Lanka's GNP, adjusted for purchasing power parity, was higher than India, Pakistan, Thailand, and even [[the_impact_of_historical_legacies_on_south_koreas_economy | South Korea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. By 1960, its per capita gross income was comparable to [[the_impact_of_historical_legacies_on_south_koreas_economy | South Korea]] and significantly higher than Thailand and Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Despite this initial optimism, a "dangerous mix of flammable ingredients" and fateful policy choices would soon ignite underlying tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Ethnic Divisions and Constitutional Challenges

Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic nation primarily composed of two groups: the Sinhalese and the Tamils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The Sinhalese are majority Buddhists and speak Sinhala, while the Tamils practice Hinduism and speak Tamil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. These groups are concentrated in different parts of the nation, with the Sinhalese (about 75% of the population) living in the south-west and north-central provinces, and the Tamils (about 13% of the population) living in the northern and eastern provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Their relations have historically been tense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

At the time of independence, the 1948 Sri Lankan constitution was not based on a broad consensus among various ethnicities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Instead, it was a product of discussions between Sinhalese elites and colonial administrators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This oversight meant the constitution failed to address the concerns of ethnic minorities, with Tamil objections often dismissed as "obstructions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Half of the Tamil legislative council disagreed with the constitution, and the other half were voted out the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Early Political Maneuvers and Economic Challenges

The first general election brought the conservative United National Party (UNP) to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Facing challenges from the Trotskyite left-wing Lanka Sama Samaja Party and the rising popularity of leftist ideologies due to inequalities, the UNP implemented expensive food subsidies and disenfranchised Indian Tamils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. These subsidies were initially funded by booming commodity prices from World War II and the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. However, when the Korean War ended in 1953, commodity export revenues crashed, forcing the government to raise prices on rice and other public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This led to widespread protests known as the "Hartal," a traumatic event that forced the Prime Minister's resignation and led to the UNP losing the 1956 general election <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Deterioration of Ethnic Relations and Policy Shifts

The 1956 government marked a significant downturn in relations between the Sinhalese and Tamil communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Ethnic harmony ceased to be a priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Political parties abandoned their multi-ethnic stances, and Sinhala was instituted as the country's sole official language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

Economically, the government imposed import restrictions on consumer goods to conserve foreign currency and then established state monopolies to fulfill domestic demands, a policy known as [[sri_lankas_import_substitution_policies_and_their_impact | import substitution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. While such policies can be effective in specific contexts, as seen in [[the_impact_of_historical_legacies_on_south_koreas_economy | Taiwan]] and [[the_impact_of_historical_legacies_on_south_koreas_economy | South Korea]]'s industrialization efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, Sri Lanka's implementation led to inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Domestic products became more expensive, and import demand shifted from finished goods to raw materials, making the economy vulnerable to price shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. By the 1970s, Sri Lanka had transformed from a relatively open market economy into one of the most closed non-communist economies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Economic growth dramatically slowed, and its development fell behind its peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

The country's once-thriving plantation economy, its "crown jewel," fell into disarray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Threats of nationalization caused foreign companies to stop investing, leading to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. After nationalization in the 1970s, operations were overseen by multiple ministries with conflicting concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. The government became the employer of last resort, doubling its GDP share since 1961 and providing over 50% of manufacturing jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This public sector employment, along with higher education exam policies, favored the Sinhalese elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This unequal scenario fostered radical ideologies among minority Tamil youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## Civil War and Economic Liberalization Attempts

The country's economic stagnation eventually built up the political will to change the welfare state-like status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. In 1977, a new government attempted reform and opening up the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. They sought to attract foreign investors and establish a labor-intensive export economy by creating free trade zones, guaranteeing against nationalization, devaluing the currency, and limiting state participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. They even managed to reduce the long-taboo rice subsidy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Sri Lanka's efforts to open up preceded [[historical_tensions_between_china_and_vietnam | China]] and many other Asian nations, earning praise and unprecedented foreign aid from the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Growth surged from 2.9% annually before 1977 to 6% between 1977 and 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

However, the 1977 election also swept Tamils into power on a platform advocating for an independent Tamil state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The government's liberalization policies were not properly calibrated, hitting the poorest members of the community hardest through inflation, removal of food subsidies, and lifting of trade protections on farmed goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Money from subsidies and foreign aid was wastefully funneled to loss-making state-owned companies, and mega-infrastructure projects like a new capital city and a house-building program were questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

The worsening conditions, combined with the government's authoritarian tendencies and heavy-handed tactics against Tamil protests, ignited a cycle of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Tamil militant wings consolidated into the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. In July 1983, known as "Black July," an LTTE attack led to a brutal anti-Tamil pogrom, plunging the country into chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Supported by the Tamil diaspora, the LTTE established a de facto state in the northern and eastern provinces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. The brutal civil war, despite several pauses, would not end until 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

Despite the civil war, the government continued its opening up with an eye towards building a labor-intensive export industry, following the playbook of other Asian economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Some loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were privatized or closed, and free trade privileges expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This reform drive continued even after the center-left People's Alliance took power in 1994, moderating their populist platform upon assuming office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Manufacturing gained prominence, ending the country's historical dependence on plantation agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. The textile and garment industry became particularly strong and globally competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

However, the war did cause notable misses, such as Motorola and Harris Corporation departing to Malaysia in the early 1980s due to political instability, a significant loss given the subsequent electronics assembly industry in Penang <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

## Post-Civil War Developments and Current Crisis

In 2007, a new administration led by Mahinda Rajapaksa came to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. His government, with support from countries like [[historical_tensions_between_china_and_vietnam | China]], launched a massive military campaign that finally defeated the LTTE in 2009, bringing peace to the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This decisive victory allowed Rajapaksa to cement his power, calling for snap elections and amending the constitution to greatly expand his executive powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

Facing high energy prices and the global financial crisis, the government emphasized its role in "guiding the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. In 2012, it reimposed export tariffs on tea and rubber to encourage domestic processing, signaling a reversal from 30 years of trade liberalization and a return to [[sri_lankas_import_substitution_policies_and_their_impact | import substitution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

The five years following the civil war saw strong economic growth, with GDP growing 7% annually, a booming stock market, and significant increases in per capita income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Inflation fell, unemployment halved, and poverty rates declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. By 2019, Sri Lanka had become an upper-middle-income country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

However, this boom had unsustainable drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. Seventy percent of the real GDP increase from 2004 to 2013 came not from labor-intensive manufacturing but from debt-fueled major public sector construction and infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Sri Lanka consistently ran fiscal deficits, repeatedly breaching agreements with the IMF, and its annual debt-to-GDP ratios steadily increased, hitting nearly 87% in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. These mega-projects, such as the Colombo Port City Project, show signs of [[corruption_and_political_ties_in_south_korea | corruption]] and were often located near the government's political power base rather than in war-torn areas needing development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. (While China is a lender for some projects, only about 10% of Sri Lanka's total debt is owed to China; the vast majority is owed to international bond markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>).

Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's traditional economic drivers were shunted aside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Manufacturing's share of GDP declined from nearly 20% in the early 2000s to 15% thereafter, focusing more on domestic consumption (food, beverage, tobacco) rather than export-oriented industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This contrasts with [[historical_tensions_between_china_and_vietnam | Vietnam]], which embarked on its manufacturing push later but surpassed Sri Lanka in market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

Domestic dissatisfaction increased, with employment becoming dependent on political connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. Many Sri Lankans sought work overseas, with nearly 2 million working abroad and 100,000-200,000 more leaving annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. Their remittances became a major economic driver, representing 6-8% of the economy and covering over 85% of the country's forex shortfalls in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

## Impact of External Shocks and Ongoing Crisis

The shift from manufacturing to debt-funded infrastructure, supported by remittances, reduced Sri Lanka's resiliency against external shocks, which arrived with the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. The pandemic significantly impacted the country's economic drivers, especially those generating foreign exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. Garment, tea, and rubber exports declined, with total exports in 2020 falling to $11 billion from an expected $18.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Foreign remittances also drastically declined due to lockdowns abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

Tourism, the third biggest foreign exchange earner after exports and remittances, also plummeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Already hit by a series of suicide bombings in 2019, the pandemic caused tourist arrivals to drop from 2.5 million in 2018 to half a million in 2020, with earnings declining by 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

With its main foreign currency generators crippled, the government turned to [[sri_lankas_import_substitution_policies_and_their_impact | import substitution]] for items like fertilizer to preserve remaining foreign reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. This, however, led to domestic shortages, power cuts, rationing, and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. The Sri Lankan rupee experienced a substantial drop in value against the US dollar, worsened by extensive money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>.

The economic hardship, though exacerbated by COVID-19, has been a long time coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. The way out of the crisis, like in Lebanon, requires coherent political leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. The government faces a deadlock, having lost its parliamentary majority and unable to work effectively with the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. Sri Lanka needs to restructure its debt, return to economic reform, and improve its relations with its people, an effort that must start from the very top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

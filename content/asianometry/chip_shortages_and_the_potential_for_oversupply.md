The [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor industry]] is characterized by high volatility, with booms quickly followed by busts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Even in normal times, conditions are unpredictable, with shipments soaring 70% one year and crashing 40% the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Currently, the industry is experiencing a significant chip shortage, leading to questions about when this might turn into an oversupply, especially with many new fabs being built or expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Dynamics of Demand and Supply

Effective planning and forecasting are crucial for the [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor industry]] to avoid shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Foxconn's chairman noted that large customers, due to proper precautionary planning, experience limited impact from shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. However, accurate forecasting is challenging because end-users do not directly purchase microchips; instead, vendors buy them to incorporate into consumer goods like PCs and smartphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Chips have a short shelf life due to rapid product obsolescence, driven by new products released each season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Missing an annual launch cycle, as AMD experienced in the mid-2000s, can have severe consequences for a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This urgency often leads foundry customers to "double book" orders, meaning they place the same order with multiple foundries to ensure stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

TSMC Chairman Mark Liu identified double booking as a key reason why the current shortage might appear worse than it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. He attributes this practice to legitimate concerns, including the [[impact_of_the_pandemic_on_semiconductor_supply_chain | pandemic]] and recent [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_and_geopolitical_tensions | China-America trade tensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. With no end in sight for the trade tensions, double booking is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Demand is also heavily influenced by the broader [[impact_of_macroeconomics_and_geopolitics_on_semiconductor_demand | macro-economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. When economic times are tough, consumers purchase fewer electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Past downturns in the [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor business]] cycle have been linked to oil shocks in 1975, 1982, and 1991, as well as the Asian Financial Crisis of 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. In March 2020, amidst a stock market decline and predictions of economic collapse, companies initially cut expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. However, stimulus packages led to a faster-than-anticipated economic bounce-back in Q3 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Interestingly, a 2005 study suggested that semiconductor downcycles are more often triggered by surges in semiconductor inventory levels and fab capacity, rather than a decrease in demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This points to over-supply as a key driver, rather than under-demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Economics of Semiconductor Manufacturing

The nature and economics of the [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor industry]] incentivize rapid production, which can lead to eventual market collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### High Cost and Depreciation of Fabs

Building a fab (semiconductor fabrication plant) is extremely expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. While Moore's Law describes the doubling of transistors on an integrated circuit every two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, Moore's Second Law (also known as Rock's Law) states that the cost of semiconductor tools doubles every four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. These tools constitute 75% of a fab's total cost, driving prices significantly upward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

*   In 2000, a leading-edge fab cost $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   By 2005, this increased to $3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   In 2020, TSMC's N5 fab in Tainan cost approximately $17 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   Its next-generation N3 process fab is estimated at $19.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

Despite research efforts to slow Rock's Law, foundries must invest billions of dollars to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. New fabs start losing value almost immediately after construction, similar to driving a new car off the lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Incentive for Overproduction

Fab construction costs are largely fixed, but the marginal cost of producing an additional chip is negligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This incentivizes foundries to make and sell as many chips as possible to amortize fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. When supply exceeds demand, prices collapse and profits decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. However, foundries remain incentivized to sell every chip they can produce, even if it generates only a small gross profit, to contribute to their future survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

Industry leaders like TSMC and Samsung prioritize market share over profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. They avoid mothballing capacity to prevent business from going to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Their massive economies of scale allow them to lower market prices to their "survival price," which is significantly below what other companies can manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This fierce downcycle eliminates lower-performing companies through bankruptcies and buyouts, leading to supply re-balancing with demand and resetting the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## Government Subsidies and Their Impact

There is considerable discussion about government subsidies for fab construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>:
*   [[future_prospects_for_chinese_semiconductor_manufacturing | China]] has a $20 billion [[future_prospects_for_chinese_semiconductor_manufacturing | semiconductor plan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   The US President Joe Biden included $50 billion in a stimulus plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   The EU is allocating 145 billion euro for a 2-nm cutting-edge fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

In the US, two key pieces of legislation are the CHIPS Act and the American Foundries Act, which would establish an R&D fund and a 20-40% tax credit for semiconductor production equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The tax credit is expected to have short-term effects (3-5 years), while the R&D fund, particularly for public-private partnerships like the one that created EUV, is seen as having longer-term effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

While acknowledging the value of national sovereignty and government investment in high-priority areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, the speaker emphasizes that commercial ventures should eventually be self-sustaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Subsidies, by design, create distortions, and while they can attract manufacturing to the USA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, these subsidized fabs must eventually stand on their own unless the subsidies become permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The renewal of such credits may face more scrutiny once the immediate crisis, like chip shortages for automakers, has passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Current Global Fab Build-Out

The world is currently undergoing a massive build-out of fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>:
*   TSMC is constructing its Arizona fab, with whispers of an upscale from the original 20,000 wafer fab plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   Samsung is negotiating a multi-billion dollar investment to expand its Austin fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   Smaller, second-tier foundries are also expanding or upgrading their capacities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   Global Foundries is investing $1.4 billion in expansion and moving up its IPO, potentially to raise capital or allow investors to cash out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | SMIC]] is receiving $2.35 billion from the Shenzhen government to build a fab expected to produce 40,000 wafers a month by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

This represents a significant amount of new capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. For example, TSMC's Arizona fab alone could produce 25,000 to 100,000 wafer starts a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Combined, this will bring hundreds of thousands of wafers to the market over the next 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

The question arises whether there will be enough demand to absorb this influx of chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. It is doubtful that past year's demand levels (e.g., from PC Masterrace types or crypto miners) will be sustained as people return to school and offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. The US Department of Defense, while a consumer, only buys 1.9 billion semiconductors a year, a fraction of what one large fab could produce in a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

The ongoing global build-out is being watched with interest and curiosity, as the current boom in semiconductors raises questions about when the inevitable bust will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

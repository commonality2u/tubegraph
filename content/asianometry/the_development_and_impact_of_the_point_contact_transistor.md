The "zero hour" for microelectronics technology is set at December 16, 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. On this date, the first [[the_invention_and_significance_of_the_first_transistors | transistor]] was discovered, fundamentally changing computing and establishing the groundwork for modern technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This discovery, born from research in radios, radars, and telephones, led to [[the_transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_solidstate_devices | the overthrow of the vacuum tube]] and ushered in the modern computing era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Origins and the Quest for a Vacuum Tube Replacement

AT&T and Bell Labs had long sought a replacement for the vacuum tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Vacuum tubes, such as the triode, were initially developed for radio, TV, and telecommunications due to their ability to rectify and amplify signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. While tubes underpinned AT&T's extensive telephone infrastructure, they also strained it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. A single transcontinental phone call in the late 1940s and early 1950s involved 12,300 vacuum tubes, primarily for signal amplification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. These tubes were large, expensive, and prone to burning out, which negatively impacted customer experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

As early as the 1930s, AT&T desired a more reliable alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. William Shockley joined Bell Labs' Vacuum Tube Department in 1936, rejecting offers from Yale and General Electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Early pre-war research focused on copper-oxide rectifiers, which convert AC power to DC for telephone power supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Recognizing their similarity to vacuum tube amplifiers, Bell Labs hired William Brattain to work with Joseph Becker to modify rectifier behavior to mimic vacuum tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. These initial experiments were unsuccessful due to a lack of proper physics grounding and the use of impure semiconducting materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Wartime Advancements in Semiconductor Purity

World War II significantly advanced semiconductor research and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. While the US initially lagged behind the British in solid-state physics for semiconductor technology, massive American resources poured into wartime research, particularly radar, made a difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Thirty to forty laboratories were dedicated to radar research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Crucial work involved producing very pure germanium and silicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. In 1942, a Purdue University team led by Professor Karl Lark-Horovitz received a US government grant to produce point contact crystal rectifiers, also known as "cat's whisker" detectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These detectors, which involve pressing a thin metal wire against a semiconducting material, had advantages for microwave radar wavelengths but often burned out due to material impurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This led to efforts to produce extremely pure germanium and silicon crystals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Before the war, silicon ingots rarely achieved 99% purity; after the war, companies like DuPont achieved 99.999% purity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Bell Labs also made significant progress in semiconductor research and production during this period, including silicon diodes and point contacts for radar detectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Post-War Bell Labs and the Discovery

Following the war, Mervin Kelly, as Bell Labs' director of research, established new interdisciplinary research groups, recognizing the potential of solid-state physics for telephone technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. William Shockley co-headed one of these groups, which included Walter Brattain and John Bardeen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

A visit to Purdue in September 1945 convinced Shockley's team that silicon and germanium were the best material candidates, with germanium preferred due to its lower melting temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. In January 1946, Shockley predicted that applying a strong external electrical field to a thin layer of silicon or germanium could modulate its conductivity, allowing for a three-terminal device like a vacuum tube triode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This concept, called the "field effect," aimed to create a solid-state amplifier or switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

However, field effect experiments conducted by Shockley's colleagues were unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Bardeen, the theorist, suggested that the electrical field was blocked at the surface of the semiconducting material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Bardeen and Brattain, a skilled experimentalist, began probing the germanium surface with two wires, but observed behavior still defied theoretical explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

After numerous experiments, Bardeen proposed placing the two probes very close together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Brattain achieved this by cutting a piece of gold foil cemented onto a polystyrene triangle, creating two very close contacts at the apex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This setup was tested on December 16, 1947 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Brattain recalled wiggling it until he had contact with both ends of the gold, successfully making one contact an emitter and the other a collector, achieving an amplification of "the order of magnitude of 100" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. This "deceptively simple setup" marked the creation of their solid-state amplifier, the first [[the_invention_and_significance_of_the_first_transistors | transistor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Secrecy, Public Announcement, and Initial Impact

AT&T initially kept the discovery a secret for several months to patent the design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The US military also reviewed it, considering classification or even an "underground" venture like the Manhattan Project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. However, due to its broad applications, the news was publicly released on June 30, 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. The New York Times' first mention of the transistor was understated, merely noting its "applications in radio where a vacuum tube ordinarily is employed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

The announcement of the point contact transistor sparked a massive global surge in solid-state physics research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Despite its historical importance, the discovery of the point contact transistor was largely accidental, and its team was pursuing a different objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. The exact physics behind its amplification remained unclear for some time, even a decade later when Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley won their Nobel Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Commercial Challenges and Legacy

As a commercial product, the point contact transistor flopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Bell Labs' sister company, Western Electric, ramped up production, making 8,400 devices a month by 1952, hoping to replace vacuum tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. However, its operation relied on semiconductor surface structures, making it extremely fragile and susceptible to humidity and temperature, leading to inconsistent performance and hindering its [[the_commercialization_and_global_impact_of_transistors_in_technology | commercial success]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

The point contact transistor was superseded by the [[the_invention_and_significance_of_the_first_transistors | junction transistor]], developed by William Shockley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. The junction transistor was a more robust "three-part sandwich" design that allowed charge carriers to flow through the entirety of the material rather than just along its surface, making it far more resilient and commercially useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

Despite its commercial shortcomings, the point contact transistor's licensing by AT&T (due to an antitrust settlement) ignited a global rush into solid-state physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. Companies worldwide began to develop their own transistors. For instance, France developed the "transistron" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>, and Japan's Electrotechnical Laboratory produced its first point contact transistor in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

The point contact transistor also found its way into early computers. In November 1953, the University of Manchester launched a computer featuring 92 first-generation point contact transistors, generally considered the first transistorized computer, though it still contained vacuum tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. This marked the beginning of [[the_transition_from_vacuum_tubes_to_solidstate_devices | the transition from vacuum tubes to solid-state devices]] in computing.

Moldova, a small country in Eastern Europe, is one of its poorest nations and is widely characterized by immense corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Over two decades, politicians enriched businessmen, who then became politicians themselves and took control of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This article will explore the historical context that led to this situation, detailing how powerful individuals came to dominate the country.

## Geography and Early History
The Republic of Moldova is a landlocked country situated between Romania to its west and Ukraine to its north, east, and south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Much of its land lies between the Prut and Dniester (Nister) Rivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It measures approximately 33,800 square kilometers, slightly smaller than Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The landscape consists primarily of forested hills and steppes, with moderate winters and warm summers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Moldova possesses rich and plentiful agricultural land, boasting Europe's third most arable land per capita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This accounts for 40% of the population being involved in farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Its most renowned export is wine, with a prestigious wine culture dating back to the early 1800s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. During its agricultural peak in the Soviet years, Moldova produced 30% of the world's tobacco and 20% of its total grape harvest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

The modern Republic of Moldova can be traced to the Principality of Moldova, founded in the 14th century, which was a vassal state to the Ottoman Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Russian Imperial Era: Bessarabia
In 1812, following the Russo-Turkish War (1806-1812), the Ottomans signed the Treaty of Bucharest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This treaty ceded a significant portion of the old principality – over 45,000 square kilometers between the Prut and Dniester rivers – to the Russian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This area was held by the Russian Empire for a century as the Bessarabia Governorate Region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The name "Bessarabia" likely originates from Basarab I, the founder of the nearby Principality of Wallachia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The remaining parts of the old Moldovan principality, west of the Prut River, later joined Wallachia in the 19th century to form the Kingdom of Romania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Post-Russian Revolution and the Soviet Era
After the Russian Revolution, the Moldovan lands between the Prut and Dniester rivers transitioned between various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. They first declared independence and then joined Romania, forming part of "Greater Romania" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The Soviet Union, however, never recognized this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

In 1939, a non-aggression pact between the Soviets and Germans deprived Greater Romania of its only ally against Soviet expansionism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The Soviets promptly demanded Bessarabia, which they acquired in June 1940 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This led to the founding of the Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic (SSR), the second smallest Republic of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

[[The impact of Soviet rule on Moldova | Stalin]] aggressively persecuted those exposed to non-communist systems, initiating purges that involved deporting and executing thousands as part of an ideological cleansing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. In 1941, Romania, allied with the Germans, re-invaded the area as part of the German invasion of the Soviet Union, holding it until 1944 when the Soviets retook control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The Soviets found the land devastated by war, mass famine, collectivization, and another wave of deportations followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

The Moldovan SSR's leadership was dominated by ethnic Russians and Ukrainians, with ethnic Moldovans rarely reaching higher echelons of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. An exception were those from Transnistria (also spelled Transdniester or Transnistrion), the region between the Dniester River and the Moldovan-Ukrainian border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This region, largely integrated into Russian culture with a population of about 50% Russians and Ukrainians and a sizable Moldovan minority, was the Moldovan SSR's most industrialized area, providing 90% of its power despite occupying only 12% of its land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Late Soviet Era and Independence
In the late 1980s, tensions between the ethnic Moldovan majority and the Soviets led to strikes across the Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Two opposition organizations formed the Popular Front, a diverse group advocating for everything from Romanian reunification to state sovereignty or communist reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. In late 1989, a massive Popular Front rally with 500,000 people demanded full sovereignty and the withdrawal of Soviet troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. By 1990, the Popular Front won most seats in the Moldova Supreme Soviet, ending the Communist Party's monopoly on power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

In May 1991, the Moldovan SSR renamed itself the Republic of Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. A few months later, in August, it declared independence from the collapsing Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Post-Independence Challenges
The Popular Front leadership initially advocated for reunification with Romania, adopting a flag with Romanian elements and loosening border controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. This move alarmed Moldova's ethnic minorities, comprising about 35% of the population, including those in the pro-Russian Transnistria region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Consequently, in December 1991, Transnistria declared its own independence, leading to a brief war that ended in a ceasefire in July 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

Moldova's goal of reunification failed, and the Moldovan people blamed the leadership for this military blunder and the deteriorating [[Moldovas economic struggles postSoviet Union | economic situation]], leading to their removal from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Like many other post-Soviet states, Moldova faced daunting challenges in its nation-building, involving a wholesale remaking of its identity, economy, and government simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

The ailing economy was collapsing, shrinking an average of seven percent annually, and the country experienced hyperinflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. In the first six months of 1992, the monthly inflation rate was 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. By the end of 1992, 79% of Moldovans fell into poverty as the government could not adjust salaries and pensions to rising prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The loss of its most industrialized area, Transnistria, which was de facto independent, further exacerbated the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

To stabilize the situation, the new government announced a transition to a functional market economy by 1996, aiming for liberalized trade where prices of essential goods were market-set, and privatization of state property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Shares in state-owned firms and land from collective and state farms were to be distributed to the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

However, many economic relief efforts came years too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Inflation did not abate until 1994 with the introduction of a new currency, the Moldovan Leu, and salary/pension indexing only began in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Privatization, though legislated in 1991, started late in 1993 due to political squabbling and lack of funds, and its execution was "bobbled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Managers with inside knowledge bought shares at obscenely low prices or simply pilfered the best assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. Agricultural land distribution was also mishandled; though 1.5 million citizens received 1.7 million hectares, it started late (mostly 1998-2000), and plots were distributed without regard for quality or fertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Smart individuals in the know took advantage, assembling massive parcels of fertile land, creating private ownership similar to old collective farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

The state privatization schemes ultimately failed to achieve their goals, instead enriching a select group of connected individuals, thereby creating a class of [[Oligarchic control and influence in Moldova | oligarchs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Meanwhile, citizens remained poor; by 1997, Moldova's GDP had fallen to 35% of what it was a decade earlier, and over 50% of the population still lived in poverty (less than $2.15/day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. The black market contributed 70% of the country's livelihood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. A 2000 poll found 91% of people dissatisfied, and by 2005, 20% of the population had emigrated, making personal remittances a major source of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Moldova continues to struggle with organ trafficking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### Political Landscape and the Rise of Oligarchs
Moldova's transition occurred amidst immense tensions between its various ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. [[The impact of Soviet rule on Moldova | Years of Soviet oppression]] cultivated strong anti-Russian feelings among some, while many still supported closer ties with Russia, like the Transnistrians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Romanian nationalists continued to advocate for reunification, citing historical ties and language similarities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. However, Romanian nationalism also had its detractors, with many strongly supporting Moldova's continued independence, possibly with aspirations of joining the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. These complex, multifaceted feelings caused significant divisions in governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:09:00]</a>.

Unlike states like Belarus that quickly reverted to authoritarianism, Moldova's weak state, poor economy, and deeply divided populace initially prevented a single authority from rising to political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Throughout the 1990s, Moldova experienced competitive elections and peaceful transfers of power, with two incumbent presidents stepping aside for their successors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. The media was openly critical of the government, and other branches curbed presidential powers, as seen when the judiciary struck down a presidential attempt to fire a general in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

However, this intense political competition, where official channels ceased to function, led people to resort to informal relationships, clans, and patrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This parallel structure planted the seeds for unparalleled amounts of [[Moldovas political and economic corruption | corruption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

### Communist Return and the Ascent of Oligarchs
In 2001, the Communist Party of Moldova, led by Vladimir Voronin, surged back into power, winning 49.9% of the vote and 71 of 101 parliamentary seats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. They achieved this by dodging questions about their past, playing on nostalgia for the "good old Soviet days," and promising free healthcare and closer ties with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. They became the only post-Soviet Communist party to recapture power after the Soviet collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

Once in power, they consolidated rule using their strong, disciplined organizational base inherited from the Soviet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Voronin initially tried to orient the country towards Russia, attempting to expand Russian language learning and pursuing a deal with Putin to resolve the Transnistrian issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. However, domestic and international pushback thwarted these plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. For the 2005 presidential elections, Voronin proposed bringing Moldova into the EU, a genuinely popular platform, and he assembled a coalition to remain president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

The 2000s became a decade of theft and [[Moldovas political and economic corruption | corruption]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Party politicians infiltrated the economy, enriching themselves and their families primarily by transferring public assets into private hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Vladimir's son, Oleg, headed a business empire in banking, construction, and railway, and his companies received rich government contracts during Voronin's eight years in power, making him arguably Moldova's first billionaire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

Voronin also established strong relations with a businessman named Vladimir Plahotniuc, who became one of his closest advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Plahotniuc's background included working as an economist for a foreign company (1991-1993) and exporting wine to Russia (starting 1996) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. By 2001, he was vice-chairman of Victoria Bank, one of Moldova's largest banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. By the end of the 2000s, Moldova had 70 billionaires, whose total wealth accounted for 138% of reported GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Plahotniuc alone was worth $2 billion, making him the richest man in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

### The "Twitter Revolution" and Oligarchs in Politics
In 2009, the Communists lost power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. After parliamentary elections, protests erupted with tens of thousands of young people arguing the results were rigged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Organized via Twitter, the incident was dubbed the "Twitter Revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. When Parliament failed to reach a resolution, Plahotniuc and a colleague defected from the Communist Party to the nominally pro-European Democratic Party of Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Despite emerging "completely out of nowhere" in media recognition, Plahotniuc quickly dominated the party, using his wealth and media ownership to become one of the country's most powerful leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

The shift was evident: initially, politicians enriched businessmen; now, those businessmen entered politics themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. For the next five years, Plahotniuc shared power with Vlad Filat, another Moldovan billionaire who had grown rich from illegal trading and buying state assets while serving as State Secretary for Privatization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Filat, who founded the Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova, served as Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. The two officially needed each other for a parliamentary majority, and they carved up the country's government into their own fiefdoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Filat controlled financial regulators and the Ministry of Economy, while Plahotniuc solidified control of the judiciary and law enforcement – a crucial weapon against his frenemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

A December 2012 scandal involving an illegal hunting trip at a national park, where a bystander was killed and attempts were made to cover it up, led Filat to move against Plahotniuc by trying to force out the prosecutor general, a member of Plahotniuc's clan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Plahotniuc responded with anti-corruption drives, and their uneasy alliance collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

### The "Robbery of the Century" and Political Downfall
Filat's gambit failed when, in November 2014, an even bigger scandal known as the "robbery of the century" dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. Three Moldovan banks were taken over and forced to issue nearly $3 billion in bad loans, about 15% of the country's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. The money was laundered through shell companies into Latvian banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. When the loans defaulted, the banks collapsed, and the Moldovan National Central Bank secretly bailed them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. To cover this bailout, the Ministry of Finance issued $1 billion in 25-year bonds, forcing the Moldovan people to pay for this theft for over a quarter century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. The Moldovan currency devalued by over 40%, causing inflation to explode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. This sophisticated scheme, masterminded by Israeli-born Moldovan oligarch Ilan Shore, ignited mass protests against [[Moldovas political and economic corruption | corruption]], the biggest since independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.

Shore was arrested and, in exchange for leniency, implicated former Prime Minister Filat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>. Filat was stripped of immunity, arrested for corruption, had his assets seized, and was sentenced to prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

With no one left in his way, Plahotniuc consolidated power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. He attempted to formally become Prime Minister but was rejected by the president who cited his lack of integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. Despite being the richest and most powerful man in Moldova, with a fortune worth over 30% of the country's GDP, Plahotniuc was profoundly disliked, holding a 95% disapproval rating and a 2% trust rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>. His clan controlled state-owned companies, financial flows, and four out of five of the country's TV stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. By the mid-to-late 2010s, Moldovans had lost trust in their government, with an 80% sentiment in 2016 that the country was going in the wrong direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

For three years, Plahotniuc had truly captured the state, controlling media, judiciary, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. He attempted to solidify his power by reforming election policies in 2017 to create a shadow voting system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. While his party was nominally pro-European, Plahotniuc lacked a particular ideology, backing pro-Russian populist Igor Dodon for president in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. His only concern was personal gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>.

## Fall of the Oligarch
Abruptly, Plahotniuc lost it all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. In February 2019, parliamentary elections resulted in a hung Parliament, with major winners including the pro-European ACUM alliance (anti-Plahotniuc), Dodon's pro-Russian Socialist Party, Plahotniuc's Democratic Party, and Ilan Shore's Sor party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>. Unexpectedly, ACUM and the Socialists joined forces, reportedly because Dodon's patrons in Russia forbade an alliance with Plahotniuc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

This strange new alliance, backed by the EU, US, and Russia, formed a government in June 2019, with ACUM's Maia Sandu as Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. Plahotniuc tried to stop this, literally cutting power to the Parliament building and having the Constitutional Court invalidate the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. However, after sustained unified international pressure, the Constitutional Court reversed its decision, acknowledging their bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>. The Democratic Party gave up power, and Plahotniuc fled the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.

Moldova began with a tough break, with years under the Soviet Union leaving the country ethnically divided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>. It struggled through a threefold transition in governance, economy, and national identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. These divisions facilitated an [[Oligarchic control and influence in Moldova | oligarch]]'s rise and his capture of the state for personal financial gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. An entire nation had to unite to evict them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>. Even after Plahotniuc's fall, Moldova remains a profoundly poor and [[Moldovas political and economic corruption | corrupt society]], requiring significant time and effort to reverse the damage from decades of poorly executed policies and bad actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

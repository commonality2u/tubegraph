The West Siberian Basin, located approximately 600 miles east of the Ural Mountains, is a vast, flat area covering 3.4 million square kilometers, nearly five times the size of Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. About a third of this area, nearly one million square kilometers, is potentially oil-bearing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Despite holding some of the world's largest oil and gas deposits, second only to those in the Persian Gulf, the region presented significant challenges for extraction and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Harsh Environmental Conditions
The West Siberian Basin is characterized by an undeveloped, harsh, and remote environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>:
*   **Extreme Weather** Summers are short, while winters are long and severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The air is humid, with temperatures plummeting to as low as negative 27 degrees Celsius, making frost and fog common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Swampy Terrain** Sixty to seventy percent of the area consists of swamps and lakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. There is no regular water supply for 9 or 10 months of the year, as the lakes freeze to their very bottoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Labor and Population Challenges
The region is sparsely populated, with most early Russian peasants settling in the Siberian south due to the cold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. To fully exploit the oil and gas bounty, the Soviets needed to bring in hundreds of thousands of geologists, builders, and work crews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>:
*   **Building Settlements** Developing the area required creating entire towns from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Worker settlements were difficult to build due to the harsh conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Logistical Support** Agriculture is virtually impossible, meaning all food had to be transported via rail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living** The cost of living in West Siberia was 1.5 to 1.7 times greater than in the European parts of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Worker Recruitment** Unlike Stalin's era, workers in the Soviet Union had freedom of choice regarding where to live and work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. To attract specialists, the Party ran media campaigns, offering higher salaries (2.2 to 2.5 times greater than elsewhere) and easier promotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Most workers were young (under 35) and signed up for short periods to earn money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Economic and Sustainability Challenges
Despite predictions by Soviet geologists as early as the 1930s about significant deposits in the West Siberian Basin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, the Soviet government initially hesitated due to uncertainty about the reserves and the immense effort required for extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Circumstances changed in the mid-1960s as the [[postwar_soviet_union_oil_industry_developments|Volga-Urals oil field]] began to decline much faster than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This decline was critical because oil production was the country's largest source of foreign currency and essential for meeting long-term export obligations to Eastern Bloc countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Under Brezhnev's urgent push starting in 1971, a new ministry was founded under Boris Shcherbina to build [[development_of_oil_infrastructure_in_west_siberia|oil infrastructure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. However, rapid growth was followed by stagnation:
*   **Declining Growth Rates** After 1975, West Siberia's oil production growth rates rapidly declined, from 23.8% in 1976 to 7% in 1981 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. By 1981, the country's total oil growth rate fell to under one percent, indicating the [[soviet_oil_production_in_the_1960s|Soviet oil juggernaut]] was sputtering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Increased Investment for Diminishing Returns** Without access to more advanced Western oil drills and pumps, the Soviets resorted to doubling exploratory drilling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Annual drilling increased from 13 million meters in 1977 to over 26 million in 1984, with 16 million of that new drilling in West Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This meant exploratory teams had to travel further, drill deeper, and work in more complicated formations, doubling per-meter drill costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Negative Growth** By 1984, Soviet oil output fell into negative growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. This implied the Soviet energy industry was investing more to produce less, caught in a cycle of "throwing good money after bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.
*   **Energy Intensity and Limited Flexibility** The Soviet economy became more energy-intensive over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Unlike Western economies where car drivers and households could adjust consumption during oil shocks, nearly half of the Soviet Union's oil consumption came from heavy industry, which was less flexible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Significant oil export obligations further limited the Soviets' ability to cut consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **1986 Oil Price Collapse** In 1986, oil prices collapsed from $27 to below $10 a barrel due to rising output from Alaska, the British North Sea, and OPEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. This meant that the significant investments made in oil production suddenly resulted in losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>. Foreign currency earnings from oil and gas sales evaporated, contributing to the debt crisis that ultimately led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

## Environmental Disregard
The rapid pace of pipeline construction, which was three to five times faster than in the West and a third of Western costs per kilometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, came at a severe environmental cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The Soviets completely disregarded ecology, resulting in:
*   Wastewater pollution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   Torn up swathes of taiga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   Hundreds of abandoned drilled wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

The economic plan had to be fulfilled "no matter what," even despite warnings about sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

In hindsight, the high energy revenues from Siberian oil "papered over the needs for much needed reforms" in the [[economic_impact_of_oil_production_on_the_soviet_economy|Soviet economy]], weakening the country's ability to stand on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) has a rich history of [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | technological advancements]] that have allowed it to become a global leader in the foundry business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Its success is often attributed to the collective brilliance of its engineers and executives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Founding Talent and Early Innovations

Many of TSMC's early brilliant semiconductor minds, including Morris Chang, [[founding_geniuses_of_tsmc | Professor Hu Ten-Ming]], Chiang Chang Yi, Rick Tai, and Douglas Yu, returned from the United States to bring their talents to Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. These individuals helped TSMC navigate complex technical decisions and allowed the company to leapfrog its rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Copper Interconnect Technology

One of TSMC's most significant technical moves occurred in 2003 with the adoption of copper interconnects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. While the industry had long used aluminum interconnects, copper offered superior performance, including 40% less resistance and 15% faster speeds, allowing for smaller, more efficient chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Despite [[role_of_tsmc_and_ibm_in_advancing_chip_technology | IBM]] inventing and patenting the first copper interconnect implementation in 1997, their technology struggled to move beyond the laboratory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. In the early 2000s, IBM offered to license their technology to TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. However, TSMC's R&D team believed copper was the future but that IBM's approach was not the right path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

In a bold move, TSMC rejected IBM's offer and invested significant resources to develop its own copper interconnect implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Within approximately a year, a team of six elite R&D scientists, including Liang Mong Song and led by Chiang Chang Yi, developed their own 130-nanometer process node with copper interconnects, shipping wafers by 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This event was critical in allowing TSMC to surpass IBM in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### 193 Nanometer Immersion Lithography

TSMC, under the leadership of Berlin, also spearheaded the industry's transition to 193-nanometer immersion lithography, with ASML adopting the technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This innovation allowed TSMC to overtake Japanese lithography makers like Canon and Nikon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Advancements in Process Nodes

### 28 Nanometer Node

In 2009, TSMC was preparing to introduce its 28-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. However, high-volume production for this node, along with its half-step sibling, the 20-nanometer node, was delayed from 2010 to mid-2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. These nodes represented the end of planar scaling as the industry had known it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### FinFET Implementation

After the 28nm/20nm nodes, TSMC and [[impact_on_tsmc_and_samsung | Samsung]] needed to adopt FinFET gate implementations, a monumental undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. TSMC named their FinFET node "16 nanometers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

In 2015, Samsung announced they had successfully brought out a 14-nanometer process node ahead of TSMC's 16-nanometer process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. This was a significant event that broke TSMC's near-monopoly in advanced semiconductor foundry business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Samsung's early FinFET implementation allowed them to attract major clients like Qualcomm and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. At a shareholders meeting in January 2015, Morris Chang publicly admitted TSMC was "a bit behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

### Regaining Leadership (10nm, 7nm, 5nm)

In response to the competition, Morris Chang galvanized TSMC, leading to a massive R&D effort to regain node leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. This resulted in successful advancements at the 10-nanometer, 7-nanometer, and 5-nanometer process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. As a result, Apple's A10 chip became a TSMC exclusive, a trend that has continued since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

Today, TSMC remains the leading semiconductor foundry, with Samsung in second place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

## Beyond More or More Initiative

In 2005, Morris Chang transferred Liang Mong Song to lead a new initiative called "Beyond More or More" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. This initiative aimed to expand TSMC's trailing edge foundry capabilities into new verticals such as MEMS, automotive sensors, and chiplet-style advanced packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. While small at its inception, this area is now a growing business for TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

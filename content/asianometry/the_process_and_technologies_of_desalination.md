Desalination is the process of removing salts from salty sea water and brackish water to produce fresh water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. While the Earth is covered in water, over half of the planet is ocean, which is too salty for human consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Providing enough fresh water is an ever-present challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The goal of desalination is simple, but the technologies involved are complicated and energy-intensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, often powered by burning fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Desalination Technologies

Modern desalination plants typically utilize one or more of three primary technologies: Multi-Stage Flash (MSF), Multi-Effect Distillation (MED), and Reverse Osmosis (RO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Industrial-scale plants often combine these technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Multi-Stage Flash (MSF)

[[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | MSF]] is a thermal process that uses heat to evaporate seawater into pure vapor, which is then condensed back into water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Invented in the early 1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, the system operates by heating seawater in a brine heater to produce vapor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This vapor then passes through 10 to 30 chambers where pressure is rapidly reduced, leading to rapid evaporation or "flashing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

MSF is known for being a reliable, easy-to-operate, and highly scalable industrial process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Its scalability is crucial for making water for entire cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, making it the most widely used industrial desalination technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. [[desalination_in_the_gulf | MSF plants]] are particularly common in the coastal deserts of the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The world's largest desalination plant, the Ras Al-Khair Power and Desalination Plant in Saudi Arabia, is an MSF plant that generates one million cubic meters of water per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Multi-Effect Distillation (MED)

[[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | MED]] is another major thermal process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. It uses multiple stages, or "effects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. In one stage, salt water is sprayed onto hot, steam-filled tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The heat from these tubes causes the water to evaporate into steam, which is then fed into the next stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This heat reuse cycle makes MED a very efficient process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Reverse Osmosis (RO)

[[msf_and_reverse_osmosis_technologies | Reverse Osmosis]] is a membrane-based methodology that uses electricity to push salt water through a semi-permeable membrane, typically made of cellulose or nylon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. High pressures are applied to force the water through the membrane, while salts are trapped by the membrane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

Other membrane-based desalination technologies include electrodialysis, which requires pre-treatment and is primarily suitable for brackish water rather than full seawater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Energy Efficiency and Cost

Reverse osmosis processes, excluding pre-processing costs, tend to be more energy-efficient than thermal processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Thermal processes require about 10 to 15 kilowatt-hours per cubic meter of water, whereas RO needs approximately 5 kilowatt-hours per cubic meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

However, thermal processes are highly scalable and offer more reliable operations, as the water does not require the extensive pre-treatment necessary for RO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. In [[desalination_in_the_gulf | Gulf countries]], where energy is abundant, thermal desalination technologies are favored for their scalability, with capacities often exceeding 100,000 cubic meters per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

The cost of desalinated water varies significantly depending on plant design, type, and location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. For example, a low-capacity RO plant desalinating brackish groundwater might cost around three to five dollars per cubic meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. In contrast, modern industrial RO plants in Florida with capacities up to 100,000 cubic meters per day achieve greater cost efficiencies, with costs slightly over 50 cents per cubic meter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This efficiency has contributed to RO's faster recent adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

The single biggest cost in desalination is the initial capital investment for plant construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. After capital, the largest operating cost is energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Doubling the cost of oil can raise water costs by 70 percent, highlighting the issue of fossil fuel price volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### Powering Desalination

Regardless of the specific methodology, desalination is an energy-intensive process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Historically, much of this energy demand has been met by burning fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The considerable [[environmental_concerns_of_desalination | environmental damage]] caused by this practice has led to exploration of [[nuclear_energy_as_a_sustainable_power_source_for_desalination | nuclear energy]] as an alternative power source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

[[economic_and_engineering_aspects_of_nuclear_desalination | Nuclear energy's operating cost]] is very stable, as uranium fuel costs have little impact on water costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Most existing [[current_global_projects_and_future_potential_of_nuclear_desalination | nuclear desalination]] systems cogenerate power and water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. For RO, the generated electricity directly powers the desalination process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. For thermal processes, the reactor generates steam that first goes into a turbine for electricity, and then this steam is routed to a heat exchanger to heat salt water for desalination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

While [[current_global_projects_and_future_potential_of_nuclear_desalination | solar and wind power desalination projects]] are progressing, nuclear desalination offers reliably high amounts of potable water at a low operating cost when implemented correctly and safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. It supports water-led growth for societies, allows for more water-intensive agriculture, reduces conflicts over limited surface waters, and avoids burning fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

## Environmental Considerations

Desalination plants require intake of large volumes of ocean water, which poses a threat to marine life. Fish larvae, eggs, and plankton can be swept up by these plants, with examinations showing up to 10-30% of fish embryos being affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Engineers implement mitigation strategies such as slower volume intake rates, nets, and other barriers, though these are not specific to nuclear desalination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. From an atmospheric perspective, nuclear desalination is considered environmentally benign, as it avoids the burning of fossil fuels to produce drinking water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

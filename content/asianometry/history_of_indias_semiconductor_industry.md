India stands as a prominent global hub for semiconductor design, with nearly every major semiconductor company maintaining a presence within the country for designing advanced chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, once these designs are finalized, they are sent to other nations like the United States, China, South Korea, or Taiwan for fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This highlights [[indias_semiconductor_import_dependency | India's semiconductor import dependency]] and its current lack of significant domestic fabrication capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

## Early Ambitions and SCL's Foundation

In the 1980s, the Indian government sought to emulate the success of countries like China, Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea, and Singapore by establishing its own national champion in semiconductor manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Earlier, in the mid-1960s, Fairchild Semiconductor had considered establishing a factory in India but was deterred by the country's formidable bureaucracy, ultimately choosing Malaysia and the Philippines instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Recognizing microprocessors and other semiconductors as a foundation for a new revolution, the Indian government founded Semiconductor Complex Limited (SCL) in 1984 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. SCL was a 100% state-owned integrated device manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Its vision was to design and manufacture leading-edge circuits and electronics, serving as the cornerstone for a native Indian electronics industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The government invested between $40 to $70 million USD into SCL, a substantial sum at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. SCL was headquartered in Mohali, Punjab, a region emerging as an electronics industry center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. SCL recruited young graduates from top technical universities like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, leveraging India's strong pool of skilled engineering talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Recruitment also occurred from esteemed Indian electronics companies like Bharat Electronics Limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### Key Factors for Semiconductor Fab Success

Establishing a successful, high-performing semiconductor factory depends on four main categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>:

*   **Financial Capital:** Significant capital is required for expensive chip manufacturing equipment (especially photolithography) and chip testing equipment, as well as for constant upgrades and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. For India, much of this equipment had to be imported from Europe or Japan, incurring import duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Human Capital:** Smart, well-educated people are essential to run the fab, including skilled labor for equipment operation and PhDs for R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. India is strong in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Government/Infrastructure:** Nearly 100% government buy-in, stable power, and water supply are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Environmental concerns also arise due to the toxic manufacturing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. While government buy-in was present in India, infrastructure posed [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | challenges in the semiconductor industry]], as a single power or water outage could ruin months of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing Technology:** Acquiring older process node technology through technology transfer deals is vital for rapid catch-up, as companies closely guard their latest innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## SCL's Initial Progress and Devastating Setback

At its founding in 1984, SCL licensed a 5-micron process technology from American Microsystems Inc. (AMI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. Subsequently, SCL acquired process technology from Rockwell (for microprocessors) and Hitachi (for electronic wristwatch components) through manufacturing deals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The company also performed third-party assembly, notably assembling the BBC Acorn computer for the Indian government's computer literacy program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

These technology transfer agreements enabled SCL personnel to receive training in the U.S. and Japan, disseminating knowledge within the company and augmenting it with university partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. SCL advanced rapidly, moving from 5-micron to 0.8-micron (800 nanometer) process technology by the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This 800-nanometer node was first achieved by leading companies like NTT, Toshiba, and Intel in 1987 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. At this point, SCL was only one [[impact_of_generational_shifts_in_the_semiconductor_industry | semiconductor generation behind the leading edge]], suggesting India could become a global semiconductor manufacturer within a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

However, these hopes were shattered in 1989 by a devastating fire at SCL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The cause remains unknown, though arson was speculated due to military processor production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Semiconductor fires are not uncommon, with insurance records from 1986-1995 showing them as a primary cause of operational losses due to flammable chemicals and corrosive gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

Regardless of the cause, the fire was a severe setback, halting production until 1997—eight years later—and requiring over $50 million in financial investment to restart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. During this period, new entrants like TSMC (founded 1987) and Samsung rapidly gained critical global market share and scale, leaving India far behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Post-Fire Struggles and Restructuring

Following the fire, the Indian government made several unsuccessful attempts to recover lost ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>:
*   Proposals to sell the fab failed due to disagreements with potential private investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   Retooling the fab from telephone exchange chips to smart card chips also did not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Finally, in 2005, SCL was restructured as an R&D Center within the Department of Space, renamed Semiconductor Lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This move effectively ended SCL's prospects as a competitive commercial entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. The company had already lost its commercial competitiveness, with most revenue coming from government contracts and its offerings being uncompetitive even in the domestic Indian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Without economies of scale, SCL struggled to turn a profit, reporting significant losses in its final years as a commercial company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Modern Day SCL and Continued Challenges

Today, SCL primarily conducts R&D work using its old 6-inch wafer fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. As of 2019, it could accept chip designs at the 180-nanometer node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. While not leading-edge, this node still has viable commercial applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. The more pressing issue is the extremely sluggish development, as it took SCL nearly a decade to reach this node, having worked on it since at least 2011 after acquiring a fabrication unit from TowerJazz Semiconductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Even before the 1989 fire, SCL faced financial strain from competing in the semiconductor business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. The costs of advancing to 800 nanometers forced them to abandon projects like the BBC Acorn computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Talented SCL personnel also frequently left for better opportunities in the private sector or abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

The sheer amount of capital required to build competitive and productive fabs remains the most significant obstacle to establishing a viable semiconductor manufacturing industry in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Leading-edge chip factories now cost tens of billions of dollars, a trend that accelerated at the 14-nanometer node generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Such investments are challenging even for large Indian private entities like Tata and Reliance, especially given [[the_volatility_of_the_semiconductor_industry | the volatility of the semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. For context, TSMC spends $20 billion on a single gigafab over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Failed Revival Efforts

Despite SCL's struggles, the Indian government has repeatedly attempted to revive the country's semiconductor manufacturing efforts, though all have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>:

*   **2006 Fab City Project:** A $3 billion project for manufacturing was announced, with AMD initially interested in an assembly and test facility, but [[challenges_in_the_semiconductor_industry | bad industry conditions]] led to its closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **2013 Customs Duties Lift:** The government lifted custom duties on semiconductor manufacturing-related imports, but this had no apparent effect on jumpstarting foundry efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **2014 Investor Proposals:** India approved proposals from two investor groups to build fabs, collectively costing $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The government offered significant financial support, including 25% of the total cost, interest-free loans, tax breaks, and subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
    *   The first consortium included JP Associates (a large Indian conglomerate), Israel's TowerJazz, and IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. In 2016, JP Associates withdrew, citing debt and the commercial non-viability of a semiconductor plant at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
    *   The second consortium, led by Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (HSMC), involved expertise from [[history_of_semiconductor_development_in_europe | European chipmaker]] STMicroelectronics and Malaysian state operator Siltera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. In 2019, the government canceled HSMC's letter of intent due to the consortium's failure to submit commitment documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

Since these attempts, no serious Indian proposal for semiconductor manufacturing has emerged, despite current market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## Current State and Geopolitical Implications

India retains world-class chip design capabilities, with tens of thousands of Indian engineers working directly in VLSI design, and their chips being taped out in leading-edge fabs globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Virtually all major fabless chip companies have a presence in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. The industry split between chip design and manufacturing, which began in the mid-1980s, means it's no longer necessary for a single entity to do both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

However, SCL's failure to become a commercial entity has had lasting consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Today, India lacks substantial, or almost any, semiconductor fabrication capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. As a result, 100% of India's chips (logic, memory, etc.) must be imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. In 2019, India imported $21 billion worth of semiconductors, a number growing at about 15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

This reliance caused disruptions during the 2020 worldwide semiconductor shortage, affecting critical Indian businesses like smartphone manufacturing, where India is the world's second-largest maker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Furthermore, a significant portion of these imports—37% or $7 billion in 2019—comes from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. This creates critical geopolitical repercussions given the tense Sino-Indian relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

To bring semiconductor manufacturing back to Indian shores, there is no shortage of ideas or human talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. However, it requires consistent, long-term direction from the highest levels of government and massive financial commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. The market has long passed the phase where a private entity can seed a thriving semiconductor manufacturing industry without substantial [[government_subsidies_and_their_effects_on_the_semiconductor_industry | government subsidies and their effects on the semiconductor industry]] and outside help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

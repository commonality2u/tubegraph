The Indian economy is primarily service-based, but pharmaceuticals stand out as a significant exception, experiencing rapid [[growth_of_indias_pharmaceutical_industry | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. As of 2020, India had the world's third-largest pharmaceutical industry by volume and eleventh by value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It is the world's largest provider of generic drugs, with the United States relying on India for 40% of its generics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. In 2020, India's pharmaceutical exports exceeded imports by $16 billion, meeting strict international standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Initially, after gaining independence in 1947, India's drug industry was dominated by foreign multinationals, holding a 90% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Domestic companies focused on marketing and distributing foreign drugs, and nearly all drugs were imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Drug prices were among the world's highest due to patents, limiting access primarily to the wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This led to the [[impact_of_the_patent_act_of_1970_on_drug_accessibility | Patent Act of 1970]], which fostered a domestic industry through process-based patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, allowing Indian firms to reverse engineer existing drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. By 2006, Indian companies supplied 95% of the country's drugs, making import substitution a success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

However, this policy resulted in a high-volume, low-value industry with around 16,000 pharmaceutical companies by 1990 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Intense competition led to low margins, vast overcapacity, and fragmentation, with up to 100 brands for a single molecule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. The domestic industry invested little in R&D and produced few new drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. While some companies turned to the export market, these were largely low-value products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## The TRIPS Agreement and its Impact
In 1992, India signed the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), a pivotal moment for the Indian pharmaceutical industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. TRIPS required India to amend its patent policies to conform to international standards, specifically by recognizing product patents and granting exclusive marketing rights for new products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

The agreement's signing was highly controversial, splitting the domestic industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Opponents argued against stronger IP rights, citing a lack of knowledge transfer and historical negative impacts on Indian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. However, proponents won out, and India was given until 2005 to prepare its drug industry for the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The government gradually implemented necessary changes, including the exclusive marketing rights amendment in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

### Monumental Shift (1992-2005 onwards)
The period from 1992 to 2005 saw the Indian pharmaceutical industry undergo a "monumental shift" towards a new, more profitable model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Companies adopted different strategies to adapt:

*   **Investment in R&D and Drug Discovery**: A few firms, like Ranbaxy, DRL, and Wockhardt, chose to invest in R&D to enter the drug discovery business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The number of new drug compounds discovered by the industry increased from 13 (1956-1987) to 7 (1991-2005) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Annual R&D spending growth accelerated from 4.9% before 1992 to 6.6% after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Indian institutions' pharmaceutical drug patents grew significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. The government also encouraged R&D through schemes and bodies like the pharmaceutical R&D support fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Challenges of Drug Discovery**: Despite increased R&D, drug discovery remained expensive and time-consuming, largely out of reach for most small and medium-sized Indian companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. By 2005, smaller firms still spent 1% or less of their revenue on R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
*   **Diversification and Strengthening the Value Chain**: Many firms focused on other strategies to strengthen or diversify revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>:
    *   R&D into drug-adjacent fields like drug delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
    *   Expanding and strengthening marketing and production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
    *   Strategic collaborations with multinationals, such as Zydus Cadila's deals with companies in France, Cuba, Switzerland, and the United States, and Biocon's deals with companies like Novartis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Biocon's joint venture with the Cuban Center of Molecular Immunology helped them develop India's first new monoclonal antibody treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
    *   Mergers and acquisitions to scale up and match the size of Western multinationals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

### [[global_export_strategy_of_indian_generic_drugs | Global Export Strategy]]
TRIPS significantly boosted India's shift towards the export market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Once the industry met its IP regulation responsibilities, the global market opened up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Today, India's generics industry is highly competitive internationally, aided by lower costs and expertise gained from its challenging domestic market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. A favorable generic drug regulatory environment, including the U.S. Hatch-Waxman Act of 1984 which eased generic drug approvals, also contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

Companies like Dr. Reddy's Laboratories (DRL) saw their export ratio of overall revenue increase from 53% (2000-2005) to 74% (2012-2017) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Marksans Pharma's export intensity grew from 21.2% to 97.5% in the same periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. The entire industry's export intensity grew at an average rate of about 13% after the 2005 TRIPS implementation, becoming nearly eight times larger with sales across North America, Africa, and Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

### [[indias_dependency_on_china_for_active_pharmaceutical_ingredients | Dependency on China for Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients]]
Despite its export success, a major concern for the Indian pharmaceutical industry is its significant [[indias_dependency_on_china_for_active_pharmaceutical_ingredients | dependence on China for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. APIs are the most crucial raw materials for finished drugs, like acetaminophen in Tylenol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. India relies on China for 70% of its API imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, with imports of Chinese APIs, especially antibiotics, tripling since 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

India used to produce these domestically but lost the market in the 1990s when China entered with products 40% cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. Even with rising Chinese labor costs, the price gap remains around 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. This industrial weakness became particularly evident in 2020 when China's lockdowns led to stock shortages and export restrictions on certain ingredients for virus medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Geopolitical tensions between the two nations further highlight the need for India to work with the government on new import substitution policies for APIs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

India's pharmaceutical success, driven by its adaptable approach to IP rights, has inspired other countries to consider similar process-based patent systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. The industry's ability to evolve based on its needs rather than rigid ideology, described as "crossing the river by touching the stones," has been key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>. Despite remaining concerns, India's pharmaceutical industry is poised to play a major role in addressing global health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.

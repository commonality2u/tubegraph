From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Despite Indonesia's cuisine not being particularly known for wheat, the nation is the world's second-biggest consumer of instant noodles, with 14.5 billion servings eaten in 2023, according to the World Instant Noodles Association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A remarkable 99% of its 285 million people have consumed instant noodles at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Surprisingly, another major consumer on the list is Nigeria, where the Indonesian noodle brand Indomie is exceptionally popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It is arguably the single most popular packaged food in all of Africa, even appearing in rap lyrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## [[historical_background_of_indomie_and_its_global_expansion | Indomie's Origins]]

Indomie's dominant position today dates back to Indonesia's authoritarian second President Suharto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Suharto often collaborated with Chinese entrepreneurs, such as Liem Sioe Liong (Sudono Salim) and his Salim Group, to industrialize the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

In 1967, Suharto requested food aid from the US government in the form of rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. As the United States and Australia had limited rice, they sent wheat instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Indonesia, lacking milling facilities, had to send the raw wheat to Singapore for processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Salim sought advice from Malaysian Chinese tycoon Robert Kuok, who suggested building flour mills directly in Indonesia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. In 1969, Salim and Kuok partnered to found Bogasari Flour Mills, which quickly became the dominant flour miller in Indonesia, holding a concession for Java and Sumatra regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Kuok initially held a 25% share in Bogasari but lost it when Salim merged Bogasari into his Indocement company, much to Kuok's displeasure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Instant Noodles & Indomie's Rise

Instant noodles were first popularized by Taiwanese-Japanese entrepreneur Momofuku Ando, who pioneered the flash-frying method for pre-cooking noodles after World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. He founded Nissin, now the second-largest noodle company by revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

In 1972, Indonesian entrepreneur Djajadi Djaja founded Indomie in North Sumatra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. The name "Indomie" simply means "Indonesian Noodles" ("Mie" means noodles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. While Supermi launched two years earlier using imported flour, Indomie gained an advantage by sourcing cheaper local flour from Bogasari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

Initially, Salim Group sold flour to various makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. During a rice shortage in the late 1970s, the Indonesian government requested Bogasari to promote alternative foods like wheat-based products for military and civil officials to spare rice for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Bogasari invested in instant noodle machinery, capable of producing 2 billion packs annually, for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. However, the rice shortage reversed in the 1980s due to the Green Revolution, creating excess capacity for Bogasari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

Bogasari then launched its own instant noodle brand, Sarimi, directly competing with Indomie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Sarimi quickly captured 40% of the market due to low production costs from its integrated milling business and a $10 million marketing campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. In 1984, Djajadi merged Indomie with Sarimi to create a joint venture called Indofood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Indofood later acquired Supermi, consolidating the Indonesian instant noodle market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Although Salim initially owned 42.5% of the JV, they eventually bought the remaining shares from Djajadi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Djajadi later sued Indofood for compensation after Suharto's fall, believing he was forced to sell, but the Indonesian Supreme Court ruled against him after a seven-year legal battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Spreading Out

Initially, Indomie was primarily sold in a soup format, similar to Japanese ramen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. In 1982, Indomie launched a soup-less dry version called Mi Goreng ("fried noodles"), which became an instant hit due to its easier preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. By 1994, Indofood controlled about 80% of the Indonesian instant noodles market through its three brands: Indomie (60%), Supermi, and Sarimi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Indomie's success is attributed to its cheap price, ease of cooking, and great taste (enhanced by MSG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Urban dwellers often consume Indomie Sayur (with green vegetables) as a complete meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. To cater to Indonesia's diversity, Indofood offers over 110 flavors, with Mi Goreng remaining the most popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Its halal status is also crucial in the world's largest Muslim population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

[[historical_background_of_indomie_and_its_global_expansion | Indomie noodles]] began to go abroad in the late 1980s, initially spreading through word-of-mouth as Indonesian foreign workers brought them overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Indofood later caught on and formed partnerships with local companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Indomie has seen significant success in the Middle East and Africa, partly due to its halal status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. In Saudi Arabia, it claims over 95% of the instant noodle market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. A factory in Syria has remarkably remained open throughout the country's civil war, providing cheap food, with the government intervening multiple times to prevent closures due to high import costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Nigeria: A Unique Market

Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, is where Indomie has made its most significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Like Indonesia, Nigeria is highly diverse, with over 500 ethnolinguistic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Its warm, tropical climate supports fruits, cotton, palm trees, and various other crops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Nigerian cuisine blends indigenous carbohydrates like yams and cassava with beans and local meats to create dishes such as salads, soups, and heavy sauces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Colonial influences (Portuguese and British) introduced New World vegetables, curry, potatoes, and chicken, as seen in dishes like Jollof Rice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Notably, wheat and wheat-based noodles are not traditionally part of Nigerian cuisine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Yet, in 2023, Nigerians consumed about 3 billion servings of instant noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## [[the_role_of_tolaram_corporation_in_indomies_nigerian_success | The Tolaram Corporation's Role]]

The story of Indomie's success in Nigeria is inextricably linked with the Tolaram Corporation.

### From India to Indonesia to Singapore

The Tolaram Corporation's origins trace back to the early 1920s when Khanchand Vaswani, son of Seth Tolaram, traveled from British India's Sindh province to Indonesia for trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Following the Partition of India, Vaswani and his family fled Sindh (which became part of Pakistan) to Mumbai, then Chennai, and eventually Singapore, before arriving in Surabaya, Indonesia, in March 1948 with the help of the Sindh Merchants Association <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

In Malang, Indonesia, Vaswani founded a textiles shop, Toko Vaswani <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. In 1950, the company adopted the name Tolaram Corporation, expanding into chain retail for garments and home fabrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Their growth stemmed from sourcing products in bulk directly from manufacturers, providing a price advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Their marketing strategy involved placing cheapest textiles in the back, encouraging parents to see more expensive items on the way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. In the late 1960s, Tolaram opened a procurement center in Singapore, moving its headquarters there in 1975 to support international trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. The company diversified into pulp, chemicals, and paper products, also holding stakes in factories globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Venturing into Nigeria

In 1977, Mohan Vaswani, Khanchand's son, was advised by a friend to explore Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. After visiting Nigeria, Ivory Coast, and Ghana, Mohan chose Nigeria due to its high population, relatively higher per capita income, and lack of consumer electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Tolaram became one of the first Singaporean companies to operate in Nigeria, trading electronics, textiles, and fishing nets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This was a risky period, as Nigeria was under military rule and faced a foreign exchange crisis in the early 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. However, as a private, family-controlled company, Tolaram could afford long-term investments; their first textile factory in Nigeria lost money for nearly nine years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### [[indomies_market_strategies_and_challenges_in_nigeria | Indomie's Entry and Success in Nigeria]]

In 1988, Tolaram began importing Indomie noodles from Indofood to Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. The idea came from Haresh Aswani, who, along with his brother Sajen, aimed to replicate Indomie's Indonesian success in Nigeria, noting the similar young and fast-growing urban population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Despite challenges like limited access to drinkable water and low per capita income, noodles were priced affordably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

Tolaram initially positioned Indomie as a food for children, targeting busy mothers with five children on average, seeking a cheap, filling meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. However, the initial reception was difficult; Nigerians were unfamiliar with the food, mistook the noodles for worms, and did not know how to cook or eat them with their hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. An advertising agency advised Tolaram to educate the public on the basics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Tolaram hired staff to demonstrate cooking methods at supermarkets and schools, even in traffic jams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Nevertheless, sales volumes remained low for the first six years after market entry in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### Going Local and Scaling Up

Believing in the product, Tolaram sought to cut expenses, especially the 40% freight cost from importing 40-50 containers monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. In 1995, the company formed a joint venture with Indofood called De United Foods, gaining the rights to manufacture, brand, and sell Indomie in West Africa, leading to the construction of their first noodle factory in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. The joint venture continued to lose money for several years, to the point that Indofood considered pulling out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

However, in June 2000, Tolaram launched the Onion Chicken flavor with a massive marketing campaign including giveaways and raffles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. This flavor, along with others like Pepper Chicken and Jollof, propelled Indomie to become the most popular noodle brand in Nigeria, surpassing competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. It took 10 years for Indomie noodles to become profitable and 12 years to exceed $10 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. After this, sales doubled annually, leading to a second plant by 2004 producing 40 million packs monthly, and a billion packs monthly by 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Today, over half a dozen plants across Africa produce Indomie for Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt, and Eswatini, maintaining dominance despite over 17 new competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## A Consumer Giant

Indomie's success from 2000 onwards marked a strategic shift for Tolaram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. The [[impact_of_asian_financial_crisis_on_indonesian_businesses | Asian Financial Crisis of 1997]] and China's rise convinced Tolaram that B2B commodity products had no future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. They decided to scale down electronics assembly and textiles to focus on growing consumer brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. This required significant investment in vertical integration, establishing their own packaging, seasoning, flour, and oil mills when suppliers fell short on raw ingredients in the late 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

[[indomies_market_strategies_and_challenges_in_nigeria | Nigeria's poor infrastructure]] (only 18% paved roads, 75% non-functional trains) meant Tolaram also had to provide basic services like electricity, water, and waste processing for its operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Tolaram's long-term commitment and operational experience in Nigeria, especially with their formidable distribution company Multipro, made them an ideal platform for other consumer brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

Since 2015, Tolaram has entered several joint ventures:
*   With Kellogg, to bring breakfast cereals and snacks to West Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   With Arla, a Danish-Swedish dairy cooperative, to introduce dairy products to Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
*   With Colgate-Palmolive in 2019, for dental health products in the Nigerian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   In June 2024, Tolaram acquired a majority stake in Guinness Nigeria Brewery from Diageo, amidst heavy competition from SABMiller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

Beyond consumer goods, the Tolaram Group is developing major infrastructure and real estate projects in West Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. In 2019, they raised approximately a billion dollars from China Development Bank and China Harbor Engineering to construct the Lekki Deep Sea Port near Lagos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. This port, capable of handling large container ships, operates under a 45-year concession from the Nigerian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. Tolaram aims for the port to serve as the core of a larger industrial ecosystem, the Lagos Free Zone, a privately-owned free trade zone for foreign companies to sell imported goods in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

India is recognized globally as a semiconductor design powerhouse, with nearly every major semiconductor company maintaining a presence in the country to design advanced chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, once these designs are complete, they must be sent abroad to countries like the United States, China, South Korea, or Taiwan for fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. India currently lacks substantial semiconductor fabrication capacity, importing 100% of its chips, including logic and memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. In 2019, India imported $21 billion worth of semiconductors, a number growing at about 15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

## Historical Attempts: Semiconductor Complex Limited (SCL)

In the 1980s, the Indian government sought to emulate the success of China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, and Singapore by establishing its own semiconductor manufacturing national champion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Founding and Early Progress
The government identified microprocessors and other semiconductors as crucial for a new revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. In 1984, the Indian government founded Semiconductor Complex Limited (SCL), a 100% state-owned enterprise with the goal of designing and manufacturing leading-edge circuits and electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The vision was for SCL to be the foundation of a native Indian electronics industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

Initial [[government_subsidies_and_investments_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | investment]] ranged from $40 million to $70 million USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. SCL was headquartered in Mohali, Punjab, an emerging electronics industry center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The company hired young graduates from top technical universities like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore, leveraging India's strong pool of skilled engineering talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

SCL acquired technology through various deals:
*   **1984:** Licensed 5-micron process technology from American Microsystems Inc. (AMI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   Acquired process technology from Rockwell for manufacturing their 2560g microprocessor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   Acquired process technology from Hitachi for producing components for electronic wristwatches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   Performed third-party assembly, notably assembling the BBC Acorn computer for an Indian government computer literacy program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

These technology transfer agreements enabled SCL personnel to receive in-person training in the U.S. and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Combining this with university academic partnerships, SCL rapidly advanced from 5-micron to 0.8-micron process technology by the late 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. At this point, SCL was only one semiconductor generation behind leading companies like NTT, Toshiba, and Intel, making India's goal of becoming a global semiconductor manufacturer seem achievable within a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

### The 1989 Fire and Its Aftermath
These hopes were dashed in 1989 when a devastating fire broke out at SCL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The cause remains unknown, though arson was speculated due to military processor production, it was most likely an accident given the flammability of chemicals in fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Semiconductor fires are common, causing significant operational losses due to toxic chemicals and corrosive gases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

The fire was a severe setback, taking eight years and over $50 million USD before production restarted in 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. During this period, new entrants like TSMC (founded 1987) and Samsung rapidly gained global market share, leaving India far behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

The government subsequently tried various failed proposals to recover lost ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>:
*   Attempts to sell the fab failed due to disagreements with private investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   Retooling the fab from telephone exchange chips to smart card chips did not succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

In 2005, SCL was restructured as an R&D center within the Department of Space and renamed Semiconductor Laboratory (SCL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This ended SCL's chances of being a competitive commercial entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Much of its revenue came from government contracts, as its offerings were not competitive domestically or internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The company struggled to turn a profit, producing only 1,000 six-inch wafers in 2005-2006 against 20 times its installed capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. In its final year as a company (2005-2006), SCL recorded a $2 million USD loss on $3.5 million revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

Today, SCL primarily conducts R&D with its old 6-inch wafer fab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. In 2019, they announced the capability to accept chip designs at the 180-nanometer node, far from the leading edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The critical issue is the extremely sluggish development, as it took SCL nearly a decade to reach this node, having worked on it since at least 2011 with a multi-million dollar acquisition from Tower Jazz Semiconductor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Persistent Obstacles and Continued Failures

[[challenges_in_indias_semiconductor_manufacturing | The sheer amount of capital needed]] to build competitive, productive fabs has been cited as the [[challenges_in_indias_semiconductor_manufacturing | single most significant obstacle in establishing a viable semiconductor manufacturing industry in India]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Leading-edge chip factories cost tens of billions of dollars, a trend that accelerated at the 14-nanometer node and continues to worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Even major Indian private entities like Tata and Reliance find these costs difficult to absorb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>; for example, Reliance Jio spent $15 billion USD on its LTE network over four years, while TSMC spends $20 billion on a single gigafab over two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

Despite the challenges, the Indian government has repeatedly attempted to revive the country's semiconductor manufacturing efforts, though all have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>:

*   **2006 Fab City Project:** A $3 billion Fab City project was announced, with AMD initially interested in an assembly and test facility, but bad industry conditions led to its shutdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **2013 Customs Duties Lifted:** The government lifted custom duties on all imports of parts and machinery for semiconductor manufacturing, but this did not stimulate any foundry efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
*   **2014 Fab Proposals:** India approved proposals from two investor groups to build fabs, estimated at $10 billion combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The government offered significant financial support, covering 25% of the total cost, interest-free loans, tax breaks, and subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
    *   **Consortium 1 (JP Associates, Tower Jazz, IBM):** JP Associates, a large Indian conglomerate, pulled out in 2016, citing significant debt and the semiconductor plant's lack of commercial viability at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
    *   **Consortium 2 (Hindustan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (HSMC), STMicroelectronics, Siltera):** This team also failed, with the government canceling HSMC's letter of intent in 2019 due to the consortium's failure to submit commitment documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

Since these attempts, no serious Indian proposal has emerged, even amid favorable market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## Current Situation and Future Outlook

India retains world-class [[indias_design_capabilities_in_the_semiconductor_industry | chip design capabilities]], with tens of thousands of Indian engineers working in VLSI design, and their chips being taped out in leading-edge fabs worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. However, the design and manufacturing of chips have largely split since the mid-1980s, making it increasingly difficult for any single company or economy to do both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

India's reliance on imported chips means it was susceptible to the [[the_impact_of_global_semiconductor_supply_chain_issues_on_india | worldwide semiconductor shortage in 2020]], which disrupted critical businesses such as India's lucrative smartphone manufacturing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Furthermore, a significant portion of these imports (37% in 2019, or $7 billion USD) comes from China, which presents critical geopolitical repercussions given tense Sino-Indian relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

While India has no shortage of ideas and human talent, re-establishing semiconductor manufacturing requires consistent, long-term direction from the highest levels of government and substantial financial commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. The market has moved beyond a phase where a private entity can seed a thriving semiconductor manufacturing industry without significant outside help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, necessitating greater government action to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

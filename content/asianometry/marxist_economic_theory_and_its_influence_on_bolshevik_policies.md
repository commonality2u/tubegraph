The early Soviet Union embarked on a radical economic experiment, attempting to establish a society without money, a direct application of Marxist economic principles that ultimately led to widespread disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Despite the country being ravaged by years of [[economic_impact_of_war_and_revolution_on_the_soviet_union | war and revolution]], the Bolsheviks aimed to immediately create their ideal socialist utopia: a moneyless society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Marxist Economic Theory on Money

Classical economists viewed money as a neutral facilitator of trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Karl Marx, however, acknowledged this but strongly disagreed with how economists downplayed money's societal role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Marx identified two primary problems with money under capitalism:
*   **Cyclical Booms and Crises**: Marx believed money contributed to the cyclical booms of over and under production in a capitalist economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Capitalists only convert money (M) to commodity (C) and back to more money (M Prime) if M Prime is greater than M <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. If not, they hoard money, leading to periodic, simultaneous production surges that result in overproduction crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Exploitation and Alienation**: Marx saw money as the mechanism by which the bourgeoisie class "parasitically sucked out the blood of the working class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Workers' wages are less valuable than the output of their labor, which generates wealth for capitalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Money acts as the seemingly neutral medium facilitating both overproduction crises and the alienation of workers from their valuable outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

Marx contended that money would be unnecessary in a socialist, centrally planned society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This notion of eliminating money was deeply ingrained and widely accepted, with the Bolsheviks never questioning it as a core facet of their desired economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Bolshevik Policies (War Communism)

Upon taking power in 1917, the Bolsheviks inherited an economy already grappling with inflation due to World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a> and the [[impact_of_world_war_i_and_the_russian_civil_war_on_the_soviet_economy | Russian Civil War]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Despite the country's semi-industrialized and largely agricultural state, not ideal for a socialist transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, the Bolsheviks moved forward with Lenin's plan outlined in "The Immediate Tasks of Soviet Rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This plan aimed to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat and centralize all economic activities into a single national plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Nationalization of Banks

Believing that controlling money gave power and that banks controlled money, the Bolsheviks targeted the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Marx had long viewed banking as central to the capitalist system, and "The Communist Manifesto" listed the establishment of a single central bank as the first step toward centralizing the means of production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

*   **State Monopoly**: On November 20, 1917, the People's Commissar of Finance seized the Russian State Bank (Goss Bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Private banks were ordered to fund worker-controlled factories, and upon their refusal, troops occupied the largest banks in December 1917 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Liquidation**: By the end of 1918, every bank was liquidated and merged into Goss Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Goss Bank ceased lending and merely kept accounts of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This nationalization choked credit flow, leading to the closure of 405 enterprises in the first quarter of 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Nationalization of Industry

Another critical step towards socialism was the nationalization of industry, announced in June 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Lenin described this as "pulling out and cutting the wires through which the capitalists controlled the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

*   **Chaotic Implementation**: Throughout late 1918 and early 1919, the government nationalized railways, shipping, mining, and other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. However, less than 14% of nationalizations were centrally managed; the majority were carried out chaotically by local organizations and trade unions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This led to the expulsion of skilled workers and owners, leaving new managers unable to operate the industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

### Hyperinflation and the Pursuit of a Moneyless Society

While aiming for a moneyless society, the Bolsheviks paradoxically printed vast amounts of money to fund their budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. This was exacerbated by the [[influence_of_military_and_heavy_industry_on_soviet_economic_policy | Russian Civil War]], which required dedicating all efforts to supplying the Red Army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Without foreign loans (due to repudiating foreign debts in 1918) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a> and minimal tax revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, printing money became the only option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

*   **Deliberate Devaluation**: Hyperinflation ensued, with 598% inflation by the end of 1918 and over 60 billion rubles in circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. By May 1919, the People's Bank announced it would print as much money as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Amazingly, the Bolsheviks interpreted this hyperinflation as a sign that their socialist transformation was working, believing that devaluing money to nothing would "annihilate the power of the wealthy money orders" and lead to a moneyless system of state distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. "The ABC of Communism" explicitly stated that extensive issue of paper money would promote the gradual disappearance of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **Monetary Chaos**: Planning became impossible as the ruble's value crashed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. By 1921, 16.3 trillion new rubles were issued, yet the government still ran a deficit of 21.9 trillion rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. In 1922, issuance swelled to 1.97 quadrillion new rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Attempts to replace money with accounting units like "tread" (a unit of labor) only caused confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

### Food Requisitioning (Prodrazvyorstka)

The Bolsheviks also sought to eliminate market forces in agriculture, building on the Tsar's wartime grain monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. With the crashing ruble, peasants refused to sell grain at official state prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

*   **Food Dictatorship**: Viewing the problem as one of distribution rather than production, the government responded by "requisitioning" food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. In May 1918, a "food dictatorship" was announced, reaffirming the grain monopoly and permitting the use of armed force to take food from peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This further disincentivized peasants from producing surpluses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

### Intensification Post-Civil War

After the Red Army's victory in the Civil War around April 1920 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, the Bolsheviks, confident in their "economic War" victory, intensified their policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. They sought to take over the entire supply and distribution system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>, making public services free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. By December 1920, Lenin signed decrees making medicines, food, consumer goods, fuel, and postage free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Private trade and money were to be banished, with taxes and wages paid "in kind" (physical goods) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. By 1921, 93% of wages were paid this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

## Consequences and Reversal

The "War Communism" policies, heavily influenced by a direct interpretation of Marxist theory, led to a catastrophic decline in the Russian economy by 1921 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

*   **Economic Collapse**: The state was unprepared to centralize control over every item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, and the belief that economic market laws no longer applied once the state took over distribution was incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Illegal markets flourished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, and production of essentials like steel, sugar, and bricks virtually ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Overall industrial production fell to a third of pre-war levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
*   **Lack of Incentive**: Without money, there was no incentive to work, leading to high desertion rates (40% in railways) and dramatically reduced worker productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   **Famine and Revolts**: Hyperinflation ruined lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>, daily caloric intake plummeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, and the 1921-1922 famine resulted in 5 million deaths, exacerbated by food requisitioning that left no reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. Peasant revolts, notably the Kronstadt rebellion in 1921, shook Lenin's confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

### New Economic Policy (NEP)

Lenin realized that market activity had to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. In March 1921, the New Economic Policy (NEP) was implemented to reverse the decline, grow output, and stabilize the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. By 1923, the government fully reversed course, issuing a gold-backed currency, making the Central Bank independent, and rebalancing the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

> [00:18:22] "we were caught up as we were in the wave of enthusiasm and having kindled the people's enthusiasm first general political and then military enthusiasm we were counting on utilizing this enthusiasm directly to accomplish economic tasks that were equally important life has shown how wrong we were" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>

Lenin attributed the mistakes of the War Communism years to the interruptions from the Civil War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. However, the state's clear intention during War Communism was to fundamentally tear the country away from capitalism, create a monopoly on trade, and eradicate money itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. These plans, derived from Marxist theory, instead led to chaos, violence, and a catastrophic collapse in production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

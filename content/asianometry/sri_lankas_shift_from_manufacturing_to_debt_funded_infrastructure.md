The ongoing economic crisis in [[history_of_sri_lankas_economic_development | Sri Lanka]] has roots in a series of [[policies_causing_economic_inefficiencies_in_sri_lanka | policy choices]] and external events that led to a significant shift in the country's economic strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. Despite an initial promising start post-independence, the nation veered from its early economic strengths towards a model heavily reliant on debt-fueled infrastructure projects rather than a robust export-oriented [[the_shift_from_manufacturing_to_service_industries_in_hong_kong | manufacturing]] sector.

## Early Promise and Initial Decline
Upon gaining independence from British colonial rule in 1948, [[history_of_sri_lankas_economic_development | Sri Lanka]] (then Ceylon) possessed several advantages: a strategic trading port, no infrastructure damage from World War II, high rankings in education and population health, and a democratic government considered a model for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. The country inherited a highly productive export economy specializing in tea, rubber, and coconuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. In 1950, its GNP (adjusted for purchasing power parity) surpassed that of India, Pakistan, Thailand, and even South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

However, a mix of [[policies_causing_economic_inefficiencies_in_sri_lanka | fateful policy choices]] and [[impact_of_ethnic_tensions_on_sri_lankas_economy | uncontrollable events]] quickly eroded this optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. Political parties abandoned multi-ethnic stances, and Sinhala became the sole official language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. Economically, the government imposed import restrictions and established state monopolies, pursuing import substitution policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. While such policies aided industrialization in countries like [[impact_of_semiconductor_facilities_on_taiwans_economy | Taiwan]], South Korea, and [[japanese_exportdriven_economic_miracle | Japan]] when done correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>, [[policies_causing_economic_inefficiencies_in_sri_lanka | Sri Lanka's wide-ranging import substitution]] led to inefficiencies, higher domestic costs, and a shift in import demand from finished goods to raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. By the 1970s, [[history_of_sri_lankas_economic_development | Sri Lanka]] transformed into one of the most closed non-communist economies, with economic growth dramatically slowing and its per capita income falling behind regional peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.

## Attempts at Reform and the Rise of [[impact_of_ethnic_tensions_on_sri_lankas_economy | Civil War]]
In 1977, a new government attempted to open up the economy, aiming to attract foreign investors and establish a labor-intensive export development model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. This led to surging growth, with garment exports increasing significantly and tourism doubling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. However, the liberalization drive disproportionately affected the poorest citizens through inflation and the removal of subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. The government's wasteful funneling of money to loss-making state-owned companies and poorly conceived mega-infrastructure projects further compounded issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.

These economic and social tensions, coupled with heavy-handed tactics against [[impact_of_ethnic_tensions_on_sri_lankas_economy | Tamil]] protests, escalated into a brutal [[impact_of_ethnic_tensions_on_sri_lankas_economy | civil war]] that lasted until 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. Despite the conflict, the government continued reforms, striving for a labor-intensive export industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. [[the_shift_from_manufacturing_to_service_industries_in_hong_kong | Manufacturing]] gained prominence, with the textile and garment industry becoming globally competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. During this period, the economy grew at about 5% annually, and poverty rates declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41:00">[12:41:00]</a>. Nevertheless, the war deterred investments in potential high-growth sectors, such as electronics assembly, which were lost to other nations like Malaysia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.

## The Shift to Debt-Fueled Infrastructure
Following the end of the [[impact_of_ethnic_tensions_on_sri_lankas_economy | civil war]] in 2009, a new administration under Mahinda Rajapaksa brought peace and consolidated power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14:00">[13:14:00]</a>. This period saw a significant shift in economic policy:
*   **Reversal of Liberalization**: In 2012, the government reimposed export tariffs on tea and rubber, aiming to encourage domestic processingâ€”a clear reversal from 30 years of trade liberalization and a return to import substitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>.
*   **Unsustainable Growth Drivers**: While [[history_of_sri_lankas_economic_development | Sri Lanka's economy]] grew well (7% GDP growth annually) and per capita income significantly increased from 2009 to 2013, the primary drivers of this growth were not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>. Seventy percent of the real GDP increase between 2004 and 2013 stemmed from [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]]-fueled major public sector construction and infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>.
*   **Rising [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | Debt]] and Fiscal Deficits**: [[history_of_sri_lankas_economic_development | Sri Lanka]] consistently ran fiscal deficits and repeatedly breached deficit reduction agreements with the IMF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:39:00">[15:39:00]</a>. The annual [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]]-to-GDP ratios steadily increased after 2012, hitting nearly 87% in 2019, further exacerbated by massive tax cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>.
*   **Questionable Mega-Projects**: These mega-projects included the massive Colombo Port City project, a "city of the future" built on reclaimed land as part of [[the_impact_of_globalization_and_manufacturing_shifts | China's Belt and Road Initiative]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. The economic viability of these projects was questionable, often located far from needy regions but close to the government's political power base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. Concerns also arose regarding corruption, with billions of dollars in "no bid" contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>. It's important to note that only about 10% of [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | Sri Lanka's total debt]] is owed to China; the vast majority is owed to international bond markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>.
*   **Decline of [[the_shift_from_manufacturing_to_service_industries_in_hong_kong | Manufacturing]]**: [[the_shift_from_manufacturing_to_service_industries_in_hong_kong | Manufacturing]]'s share of GDP peaked around 20% in the early 2000s but trended downwards to 15% thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>. The [[the_shift_from_manufacturing_to_service_industries_in_hong_kong | manufacturing]] that did grow focused on servicing the domestic sector (e.g., food, beverage, tobacco) rather than export-oriented industries like garments or electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:26:00">[17:26:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with countries like Vietnam, which later embarked on a successful [[the_shift_from_manufacturing_to_service_industries_in_hong_kong | manufacturing]] push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Remittances**: With domestic dissatisfaction rising and employment often dependent on government standing, many [[history_of_sri_lankas_economic_development | Sri Lankans]] sought work abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. Their remittances became a major economic driver, representing 6-8% of the economy and the second-biggest earner of foreign income after exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:15:00">[18:15:00]</a>. In 2019, remittances covered over 85% of the country's foreign exchange shortfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>.

## Consequences and Current Crisis
This fundamental shift from export-oriented [[the_shift_from_manufacturing_to_service_industries_in_hong_kong | manufacturing]] to [[role_of_debt_in_daewoos_collapse | debt]]-funded infrastructure, supported by remittances, significantly reduced [[history_of_sri_lankas_economic_development | Sri Lanka's]] resiliency against external shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>. The [[effect_of_the_pandemic_on_sri_lankas_economic_crisis | COVID-19 pandemic]], coupled with prior events like the 2019 suicide bombings, severely impacted key foreign exchange earners such as garment exports, remittances, and tourism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>. This led to drastic declines in earnings, a substantial drop in the value of the Sri Lankan Rupee, and widespread shortages, power cuts, rationing, and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>.

The [[effect_of_the_pandemic_on_sri_lankas_economic_crisis | pandemic]] might have been the final push, but the [[history_of_sri_lankas_economic_development | country]] had been on the brink for a very long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>. The path out of the crisis necessitates coherent political leadership, debt restructuring, a return to genuine economic reform, and improved relations between the government and its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>.

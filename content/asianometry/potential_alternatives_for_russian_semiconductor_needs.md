In late February 2022, [[impact_of_tsmc_sanctions_on_russia | TSMC]] announced it would halt shipments to Russia due to a new round of sanctions [00:00:00]. This halt impacted shipments to Russian fabless companies like Baikal, MCST, Yadro, and STC Module [00:00:13]. Additionally, Intel and AMD also ceased their shipments to Russia [00:00:19]. This situation has highlighted Russia's long-standing [[challenges_in_russian_semiconductor_manufacturing | challenges in Russian semiconductor manufacturing]] and the need for alternative sources for its chip requirements [00:00:31].

## Domestic Manufacturing Limitations
Russia has been attempting to establish its own semiconductor supply, and while there have been some interesting domestic design successes, the country's capacity to manufacture these designs has fallen significantly behind [00:00:23]. [[russian_domestic_semiconductor_companies_and_their_developments | Russian industrial policy]] after the Soviet collapse exacerbated this issue by pivoting away from domestic electronics, increasing Russia's dependence on imports [00:02:08].

Today, Russia remains a net importer of integrated circuits, with the majority coming from Malaysia, [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China]], Vietnam, and other Asian countries, including Taiwan [00:02:20].

While Russia possesses domestic fabs like [[russian_domestic_semiconductor_companies_and_their_developments | Micron Group]] and [[russian_domestic_semiconductor_companies_and_their_developments | Angstrom]], their capabilities are limited:
*   [[russian_domestic_semiconductor_companies_and_their_developments | Micron Group]], Russia's largest domestic semiconductor manufacturing company, can produce 100, 150, and 200-millimeter wafers [00:04:50]. Its most sophisticated production line is 90 nanometers, launched in 2012, putting it about nine years behind the leading edge at the time [00:05:08]. Although Micron claimed to achieve a 65-nanometer node in 2014, this process appears to be "under development production, qualification and implementation" rather than a commercial offering [00:06:01, 00:06:43]. This puts Russia about 15+ years behind the leading edge for this node [00:06:59].
*   [[russian_domestic_semiconductor_companies_and_their_developments | Angstrom]] offers 130 nanometer and 90 nanometer process nodes on 200-millimeter wafers, with a capacity of about 180,000 wafers per year [00:09:03, 00:09:11]. This is significantly less than a [[impact_of_tsmc_sanctions_on_russia | TSMC]] gigafab, which can produce an equivalent number in a single month [00:09:17]. Angstrom also faced bankruptcy due to debt and U.S. sanctions, which prevented an export business [00:09:23, 00:10:05, 00:10:14].

Due to these domestic limitations, sophisticated Russian semiconductor design ventures like Elbrus microprocessors by the Moscow Center of SPARC Technologies and Baikal CPUs by Baikal Electronics have historically relied on foreign fabs [00:10:40, 00:10:48]. For instance, the Elbrus 2SM was originally made using a [[impact_of_tsmc_sanctions_on_russia | TSMC]] 90-nanometer node [00:11:28], and Baikal's latest offering, the Baikal-M series, was fabbed on a [[impact_of_tsmc_sanctions_on_russia | TSMC]] 28-nanometer process [00:12:14].

## Potential Alternative Sources

### Belarus
Belarus, a close ally of Russia, was home to a significant portion of Soviet integrated circuit production [00:13:31].
*   **Integral**: This company was one of the "big three" Soviet semiconductor manufacturers [00:13:40]. As of a 2017 sales document, Integral's most sophisticated node was a 350-nanometer process [00:13:55]. This technology first hit the market in 1993, making it not a viable alternative to more advanced nodes like [[impact_of_tsmc_sanctions_on_russia | TSMC]]'s 28-nanometer process [00:14:00, 00:14:06].

### China
[[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | Chinese semiconductor foundries]] are considered a more capable replacement for advanced fabs like [[impact_of_tsmc_sanctions_on_russia | TSMC]] [00:14:12].
*   **SMIC (Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation)**: SMIC's most advanced node is a 14-nanometer process, rumored to have good yields [00:14:18]. The company had a strong 2021 and is investing $9 billion into a new fab [00:14:31]. Given the warm relations between Russia and [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China]], SMIC might appear to be a logical choice [00:14:36].
*   **Challenges for SMIC**: However, SMIC heavily relies on chip-making equipment imported from the Netherlands and Japan [00:14:44]. This dependency could expose SMIC to secondary sanctions if it were to extensively fab chips for Russia, potentially limiting its ability to serve as a reliable, long-term alternative for advanced nodes.

## Outlook
In the short to medium term, the halt of shipments may not have an immediate drastic effect on Russia, as it possesses large stockpiles of raw products and has contingency plans [00:14:52, 00:14:58]. Furthermore, many military applications do not require cutting-edge 7-nanometer chips [00:15:00].

However, these sanctions will further hinder the modernization and digitization of Russia's industries, which already lag significantly behind Western peers [00:15:06, 00:15:10]. For example, Russia has 23 times fewer industrial robots per 10,000 employees than the world average, and only 10% of its industry uses computer numerical control (CNC) machines [00:15:17, 00:15:23]. The inability to bridge the widening technology gap, similar to the Soviet era's struggle with the West, could contribute to a loss of confidence in the country's technological competency [00:15:43].# Potential Alternatives for Russian Semiconductor Needs

In late February 2022, [[impact_of_tsmc_sanctions_on_russia | Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC)]] announced it would halt shipments to Russia due to a new round of sanctions [00:00:00]. This halt impacted shipments to Russian fabless companies like Baikal, MCST, Yadro, and STC Module [00:00:13]. Additionally, Intel and AMD also ceased their shipments to Russia [00:00:19].

[[russian_domestic_semiconductor_companies_and_their_developments | Russian industrial policy]] in the immediate wake of the Soviet collapse exacerbated this issue by pivoting away from domestic electronics, which has caused the country to become more dependent on imports [00:02:08].

Today, Russia remains a consumer and net importer of integrated circuits, with the majority of these components coming from Malaysia, [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China]], Vietnam, and other Asian countries, including Taiwan [00:02:20].

This ongoing delay means Russia's gap with the leading edge for this node has grown to 15+ years [00:06:59].
*   [[russian_domestic_semiconductor_companies_and_their_developments | Angstrom]] offers 130 nanometer and 90 nanometer process nodes on 200-millimeter sized wafers [00:09:03]. Their capacity is about 180,000 wafers a year [00:09:11], which is significantly less than a [[impact_of_tsmc_sanctions_on_russia | TSMC]] gigafab that produces an equivalent number in a single month [00:09:17].

## Potential Alternative Sources

### Belarus
As briefly mentioned, a significant portion of Soviet integrated circuit production was located in Belarus [00:13:31].
*   **Integral**: This company was the third of the "big three" Soviet semiconductor manufacturers [00:13:40]. According to a 2017 sales document, Integral's most sophisticated node is a 350-nanometer process [00:13:55].

*   **SMIC (Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation)**: SMIC's most advanced node is a 14-nanometer process, which is rumored to have very good yields [00:14:18]. The company recently had a very good 2021 and is investing $9 billion into a new fab [00:14:31]. Given the current warm relations between Russia and [[chinas_semiconductor_manufacturing_efforts | China]], SMIC might make a lot of sense as an alternative [00:14:36].

## Outlook
In the short and medium term, the halt of shipments may not have an immediate drastic effect on Russia, as it possesses large stockpiles of raw product and has drawn up contingency plans [00:14:52, 00:14:58]. Moreover, guns do not require a seven-nanometer chip [00:15:00].

That being said, these sanctions will further hinder the modernization and digitization of Russia's industries, which already chronically lag behind its Western peers [00:15:06, 00:15:10]. For instance, Russia has 23 times fewer industrial robots per 10,000 employees than the world average, and its share of computer numerical control (CNC) machines in the industry is only ten percent [00:15:17, 00:15:23]. These sanctions make it significantly harder for Russian businesses and the ordinary people they employ to make ground [00:15:35]. The inability to close the ever-widening technology gap with the West, a factor that contributed to a broad loss of confidence in the Soviet communist party's competency during the late regime, might resurface [00:15:43].

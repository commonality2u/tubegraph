Hong Kong's shift away from manufacturing and its increasing reliance on a service-based economy, particularly finance and real estate, has created significant challenges for its young people and the broader labor market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Economic Shift and [[deindustrialization_and_its_impact_on_hong_kongs_economy | Deindustrialization]]

Initially, after the Chinese Civil War, Shanghai industrialists fled to Hong Kong, bringing capital and manufacturing expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. They established factories, taking advantage of the influx of Chinese migrants to produce lightly manufactured items like plastic flowers, clothes, and radio assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. By the early 1960s, Hong Kong was the largest manufacturer in the developing world, providing low-skilled jobs that helped people build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

However, competition from places like South Korea and Taiwan emerged, and rising worker salaries in Hong Kong led to increased costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Hong Kong's manufacturing industry primarily relied on cheap labor and lacked technological expertise for producing native technologies, requiring imports for critical components like integrated circuits from Japan, which accounted for 60% of electronics OEMs' cost budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Hong Kong's status as a British colony also played a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The British colonial administration likely intended Hong Kong to be a simple trading post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. A fiscal compromise was reached: no import or export taxes, with government revenue primarily from land leases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This incentivized an economy centered on rising land prices and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. By 1949, Hong Kong's largest companies were banks, land development companies, and trading houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Many industrialists, like Li Ka-shing, converted their factories into more profitable landlord businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

As a result, the Hong Kong government adopted a non-interventionist stance towards manufacturing, leading to a massive loss of lower and middle-income jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The city instead doubled down on finance and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, becoming a value-added intermediary for investments and cargo between China and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This shift is clearly seen in its GDP contributions:
*   **1980:** Service industry contributed 68% of Hong Kong's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **2000:** Increased to 86.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **2019:** Reached 93.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## [[impact_of_competition_from_china_and_other_asian_economies_on_hong_kong | Impact of Competition from China]]

Hong Kong Chief Executives like Tung Chee-hwa and Donald Tsang did not try to reverse the trend, believing that Hong Kong benefited most when capital and trade flowed freely between China and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. However, as China continued to reform and open up, Hong Kong's role as a service intermediary became less crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

The Pearl River region has become a major logistics and transport center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, and Shanghai has absorbed many of Hong Kong's service economy functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Chinese mainland cities have reformed financial restrictions, allowing foreign capital directly into their ports and logistic networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Hong Kong's share of China's trade with the rest of the world has plummeted from 60% in 1997 to 28% in 2007, and merely 10% in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

As transport, trade, and logistics decline, the financial services sector has become Hong Kong's primary growth engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **2000:** Finance, insurance, and real estate contributed 18% of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **2019:** This share grew to nearly 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

However, even the financial sector faces increasing competition as China lifts foreign ownership restrictions on its investing and banking markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. In 2020, China allowed foreign banks, securities, and fund management firms to fully own their Chinese subsidiaries, enabling direct offering of financial products and services to Chinese consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Challenges for Young People

This economic landscape poses significant challenges for young Hong Kongers seeking wealth and economic security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Obscene Property Prices
Historically, Hong Kongers built wealth by buying houses, but property prices have become "obscene," far outpacing wage growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Most young people cannot afford to own a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. The government's inability to address this is compounded by the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the US dollar, which limits control over interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Much undeveloped land is controlled by large land development monopolies, and attempts at housing price reform in the 1990s failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### Limited Job Prospects and Wage Inequality
The government's current vision for its people involves working in high-tech industries and investing in wealth-building assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. However, the availability of such high-paying, high-value jobs is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

The financial sector, even with increased Chinese IPOs, will not provide enough jobs. Finance, insurance, and real estate (excluding construction) account for less than 10% of the city's jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Nearly 85% of Hong Kong's adult population (over 3.1 million people) work for large service-oriented companies like supermarkets, utilities, and business services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This sector is stagnant, dominated by large land developer business conglomerates, and is highly anti-competitive, making it difficult for new entrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

This contributes to "massive and growing wage inequality," where bankers and executives earn significantly more than everyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Many service workers are over-educated for their jobs with few prospects for career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Government Response and Its Paradoxes

While the government is attempting to open new career pathways, having previously focused on strengthening the service industry and "four key industries" (financial services, tourism, trading/logistics, professional services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, attitudes have begun to change since 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. They have identified emerging industries to develop into a knowledge-based economy:
*   Cultural and creative industries (including games and software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>
*   Medical services (e.g., medical tourism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>
*   Education services (profit and non-profit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>
*   Testing and certification (e.g., ISO certification for Pearl River area companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>
*   Innovation and technology, which is seen as a powerful growth engine for young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>

Despite these efforts, encouraging stock ownership as a wealth-building strategy for the lower classes is problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. A 2015 survey found that the average Hong Kong retail stock investor was 47 years old and already made substantially more than the average household income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Stocks are often a way to *stay* rich, not *get* rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, and Hong Kong stocks have shown lagging performance compared to international benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

Many of Hong Kong's listed companies operate within the city, and actions taken to increase shareholder value (such as mass layoffs or moving workers to non-standard employment) can increase economic burdens and income insecurity for residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

### Financialization of Public Assets
Since real estate became too expensive for the average Hong Konger, the government and financial sector have sought to package new assets into investment vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.
*   **MTR Privatization:** In 2000, the Hong Kong government partially privatized the MTR, the railway company also known for land development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. After privatization, the MTR stopped receiving free land grants for railway extensions, and its land development profits significantly declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. The MTR shifted its focus to more profitable land management, advertising, and telecom services, which, while making it less of a financial burden on the government, risks hindering long-term mass transit network expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
*   **The Link REIT:** The government sold car parking and retail facilities for its public housing complexes to a real estate investment trust called The Link, purportedly to raise funds for the housing authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. This IPO, subscribed by retail investors, valued The Link at up to five times its IPO price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Subsequently, The Link raised rents on its tenants, causing economic hardship for many shop owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

While these choices have generated wealth for some and boosted Hong Kong's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, they come at a considerable cost to the majority who are poorer and perceive limited opportunities for upward mobility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

## Current Economic Challenges of [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV Lithography]]
[[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography]] is currently in use, with leading foundries utilizing dozens of these $150 million machines to create patterns nanometers wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Despite its technical success, substantial commercial challenges remain, primarily concerning throughput – the number of wafers a single machine can produce over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

For instance, TSMC's leading-edge N5 process incorporates about 14 to 15 [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Since [[euv_lithography_technology and its challenges | EUV]] machines are slower than older machines, more units are needed to maintain wafer output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. By the second half of 2020, TSMC had acquired 50% of the installed [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] base by purchasing as many machines as [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] could produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. However, this approach resulted in high costs: industry analysts estimate each N5 wafer to cost as much as a car, nearly $17,000, representing a theoretical 80% price jump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. To reduce this cost, faster throughput is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

TSMC's subsequent N3 node further exacerbates this issue, requiring more [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] layers (20-25 compared to N5's 14-15), which risks a decline in throughput and hinders the ability to achieve necessary economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### The Problem of Multiple Patterning
To improve feature density, foundries often resort to "multiple patterning," where an additional exposure is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. While effective for creating smaller features (e.g., a 13-nanometer noodle with a 26-nanometer cutter), this technique can double or even triple the time required to process a single layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This makes [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]], which is already slow, "decidedly uneconomical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## High NA [[challenges_and_potential_of_high_na_euv_technology | EUV]] as an Economic Solution
The more economical alternative to buying more existing [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] machines is to acquire [[challenges_and_potential_of_high_na_euv_technology | EUV]] machines that perform lithography better and faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This is the primary objective of [[challenges_and_potential_of_high_na_euv_technology | High NA EUV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

[[challenges_and_potential_of_high_na_euv_technology | High NA EUV]] improves resolution by increasing the numerical aperture (NA), which measures how much light an optic system can collect and focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The resolution formula (k1 * light wavelength / NA) indicates that increasing NA is the remaining major factor for improvement, as k1 is near its physical limit and wavelength was already reduced significantly with current [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

[[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]]'s most advanced current [[euv_lithography_technology_and_its_challenges | EUV]] machine, the NXE 3600D, has an NA of 0.33, resulting in a 26-nanometer pitch and a throughput of about 160 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The first [[challenges_and_potential_of_high_na_euv_technology | High NA EUV]] machine, the EXE 5000, will increase the NA from 0.33 to 0.55, translating to a 16-nanometer pitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This represents a 67% improvement, making it the preferred method for the N3 process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

Beyond smaller pitches, [[challenges_and_potential_of_high_na_euv_technology | High NA EUV]] can print at a much higher resolution, leading to fewer defects and thus more usable wafers per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Crucially, if [[challenges_and_potential_of_high_na_euv_technology | High NA EUV]] performs as advertised, it can replace layers that previously required multiple patterning at lower wavelengths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This efficiency—doing in one pass what previously took two or three—is expected to truly justify the use of [[challenges_and_potential_of_high_na_euv_technology | High NA EUV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Addressing Wafer Area Shrinkage
A challenge for [[challenges_and_potential_of_high_na_euv_technology | High NA EUV]] was that increasing magnification (from 4x to 8x) to achieve the higher NA without mask shadowing effects would shrink the wafer area to a quarter of its previous size (from 33mm x 26mm to 16.5mm x 13mm) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This reduction would make the machine "economically unacceptable" as it would take too long to process a wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

To counter this, [[future_developments_in_euv_systems_by_asml | ASML]] and Zeiss developed anamorphic imaging, where magnification factors can differ on the x and y axes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. By applying the 8x magnification only along the y-axis, the system can project a 16.5mm x 26mm field, which is "half size, just barely acceptable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

## Cost of [[challenges_and_potential_of_high_na_euv_technology | High NA EUV]] Systems
The first [[challenges_and_potential_of_high_na_euv_technology | High NA EUV]] machines, the EXE 5000, are expected to reach customers by late 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. An improved version, the EXE 5200, is anticipated by 2024 or 2025, with an expected throughput of 220 wafers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. These machines will be massive in size and come with a "monstrous price tag," topping $300 million each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. This price point means the EXE 5000, despite being an engineering marvel, will have to justify its significant cost through its performance and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

Singapore heavily relies on natural gas for its electricity generation, with 95% of its electricity coming from burning natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The island nation faces significant limitations in developing alternative energy sources due to its small size, which leaves no room for extensive solar or wind farms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Only a limited number of rooftop solar panels are found on residential buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Addressing Energy Needs Through Importation
To diversify its energy mix and reduce its dependence on natural gas, Singapore is exploring options to import electricity from overseas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. A key initiative in this regard is the [[australia_asean_power_link_project | Australia-ASEAN Power Link]] mega-project, also known as the "Sun Cable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This project aims to transmit renewable solar energy from Australia to Singapore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

The Sun Cable project, when fully operational, is projected to supply up to 20% of Singapore's energy needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. The project is scheduled to come online around 2027 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

The global semiconductor industry has experienced a significant shortage in recent years, particularly affecting [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics | trailing edge semiconductors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. An example is the ATS AMD 21 microcontroller (MCU), a small 48-megahertz ARM chip made by Microchip Technology, which was out of stock for a year as of the recording, with related systems also out of stock until 2023 or beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. While advanced technologies like extreme ultraviolet lithography often garner attention, the most severe impact of the chip shortage has been felt in these less advanced, but widely used, chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Understanding Trailing Edge Semiconductors

Most chips are not advanced "three-nanometer monsters" but rather "unheralded workhorses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. These are built using [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics | trailing edge process nodes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

*   **Definitions**: TSMC defines trailing edge as anything 16 nanometers or older, which accounted for approximately 50% of their 2021 revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Further subdivisions include:
    *   **Mature Nodes**: Generally in the 40 to 450-nanometer range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   **Legacy Nodes**: Anything older than 450 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
    *   Most microcontrollers are produced with 110 or 180-nanometer processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Fabs**: Approximately 200 fabs globally operate with older equipment, many built before 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. While initially making leading-edge chips with high margins, these fabs' product prices eventually collapse as they commoditize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. However, once built, they require little additional effort or investment, allowing them to continue operation as long as market price exceeds variable costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Pre-Pandemic Supply Tightness

Capacity for [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics | trailing edge nodes]] was already relatively tight for several years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, due to specific industry factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Pandemic's Immediate Impact (Early 2020)

*   **Economic Downturn**: The initial pandemic lockdowns in early 2020 caused economic activity to plummet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Production Halts**: Companies like automotive manufacturers and other industries halted production lines and canceled orders with suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This led to suppliers, such as STMicroelectronics, cutting production, in their case by 50% at their most advanced fabs in France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Post-Lockdown Bounce Back

*   **Unexpected Recovery**: A "massive unexpected bounce back" in economic activity occurred in the summer of 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Inventory Depletion & Hoarding**: Companies first used up their existing inventories, then began purchasing more than necessary to replenish depleted stocks and ensure future production, contributing to shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Increased Demand**: The broader semiconductor industry simultaneously experienced [[impact_of_macroeconomy_on_semiconductor_demand | unprecedented demand]] for chips, driven by factors such as cloud computing, the 5G wireless transition, and armed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **High Fab Utilization**: Since 2019, fab utilization rates have risen significantly beyond their long-term target of 80%, reaching levels in the mid-90s, indicating foundries are operating at their maximum capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Challenges in Addressing the Shortage

Despite the clear need, resolving the [[challenges_in_semiconductor_forecasting_and_supply_chain | shortage in trailing edge semiconductors]] is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Investment Hesitancy
*   **Financial Disincentives**: Trailing edge chip makers have been reluctant to invest in new fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Customers are accustomed to low prices from foundries with fully depreciated fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Despite contributing significant microprocessor volume, wafers for these nodes are cheap, accounting for only 10% of total sales revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Investing hundreds of millions or billions in a new fab is expected to lead to substantial underutilization and poor financial performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Equipment Availability**: Many older fabs utilize niche equipment, such as those making 200-millimeter wafers (smaller than the current 300-millimeter standard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. New 200-millimeter equipment is not readily available, with companies preferring refurbished options, leading to supply shortages in this area as existing fabs run at high capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Technological Stagnation and Design Challenges
*   **Slowed Upscaling**: The trend of scaling up chip designs to newer nodes has slowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Customers must weigh benefits against costs, and some chip types, like analog, mixed-signal, radio frequency, and MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems), do not scale up effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Demand for these chips is very high, particularly due to conflicts like the Ukrainian war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **The 28-22 Nanometer Gap**: The 28-nanometer node is significant as it's typically the most advanced node still using a planar gate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Newer nodes involve the more complex FinFET gate, multi-patterning concerns, and potentially extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography, all contributing to increased complexity, lower yields, and higher costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Consequently, 28-nanometer represents the bottom of the cost curve on a per-100-million gate basis, with costs increasing at newer nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Many customers do not need the speed of newer nodes, especially with these trade-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Automotive Industry Needs**: Automotive companies, which consume 40% of trailing edge chips, prioritize reliability and effectiveness in challenging conditions over raw speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Industry Response and Outlook

With backlogs stretching 18 months or longer for older nodes, the industry is beginning to address the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Increased Investment in New Fabs
*   **Global Commitments**: While the semiconductor industry has committed hundreds of billions to new fabs globally, only 6% of this expenditure is for mature or legacy node capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Microchip executive chairman Steve Sanghi states that $150 billion in additional investment is needed over the next five years to meet [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics | trailing edge demand]] growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **TSMC**: Is building two new [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics | trailing edge fabs]] in Japan and Kaohsiung, operating on the 28-22 nanometer node range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. TSMC has also announced price increases on older nodes to help fund these new fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.
*   **Samsung**: Has announced increased investment in [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics | trailing edge semiconductor capacity]], a significant shift for a company typically focused on cutting-edge technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **China**: Has up to a dozen new fabs under construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. SMIC, the leading Chinese foundry, is investing over $9 billion to add [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics | trailing edge wafer capacity]] in Shanghai and Shenzhen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **[[the_impact_of_global_semiconductor_supply_chain_issues_on_india | India]]**: The Vedanta conglomerate has partnered with Foxconn to build a [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics | trailing edge fab]] in the 65 to 28-nanometer range with substantial government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **[[impact_of_chips_act_on_us_semiconductor_industry | US Chips Act]]**: This American bill includes an appropriation of $2 billion specifically for "mature technology nodes" to incentivize construction and modernization in the American semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Optimizing Existing Fabs
*   **Wafer Upgrades**: Converting from 200-millimeter wafers to 300-millimeter wafers can yield over two times as many dies, effectively doubling output without building a new fab, though it requires significant changes to floor layout and automation systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Design-Side Improvements**: Initiatives like open-source EDA software and PDKs aim to make hardware development cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. New tools can facilitate designing for or performing a die shrink onto another node, potentially leading to faster and better chips for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Future Outlook
Supply constraints for [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics | trailing edge nodes]] are expected to persist until at least 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. However, some positive signs include:
*   Slowing growth in revenues for [[global_semiconductor_supply_chain_dynamics | trailing edge nodes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   Major players, China, and India are actively building new fabs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   An apparent slowing in the [[impact_of_macroeconomy_on_semiconductor_demand | macro economy]] could dampen overall demand, potentially coinciding with new supply capacity hitting the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

The economic crisis in Sri Lanka is a culmination of long-standing issues, but the COVID-19 pandemic provided the final push into severe hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. The nation's [[sri_lankas_shift_from_manufacturing_to_debt_funded_infrastructure | shift from manufacturing to debt-funded infrastructure]] and reliance on remittances reduced its resilience to external shocks, which arrived with the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.

## Pandemic's Immediate Economic Impacts
The pandemic significantly impacted Sri Lanka's key economic drivers, especially those generating foreign exchange, starting in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.

### Export Decline
Exports of garments, tea, and rubber rapidly declined due to lockdowns in major markets like India, Europe, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. The Sri Lankan Export Development Board had projected $18.5 billion in export earnings for 2020, but actual total exports amounted to only $11 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

### Plummeting Remittances
Foreign remittances, a major economic driver representing 6.8% of the country's economy and the second-biggest earner of foreign income after exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, also drastically declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. Lockdowns in countries such as South Korea and Qatar meant migrant workers were unable to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. Reduced international travel further hindered workers' ability to go abroad, adding downward pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. In 2019, $6.7 billion in remittances covered over 85% of the country's forex shortfalls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

### Collapse of Tourism
The tourism industry, which had seen double-digit growth with the boom in Chinese tourism after the civil war ended and became the country's third-biggest foreign exchange earner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>, was severely hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Coming after a series of suicide bombings in 2019, the pandemic caused tourism to plummet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. While 2.5 million tourists visited Sri Lanka in 2018, generating $5.6 billion in foreign exchange, only half a million tourists came in 2020, leading to an 80% decline in earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

## Consequences for the Economy
With the second and third largest foreign currency generators—remittances and tourism—crippled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>, the government resorted to import substitution, such as for fertilizer, to preserve dwindling foreign reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. This policy, in turn, led to domestic shortages, power cuts, rationing, and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

The Sri Lankan rupee experienced a substantial devaluation against the US dollar since March 2022, exacerbated by extensive money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. Without access to foreign currency, citizens' savings have vanished, threatening to return them to poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. The situation in Sri Lanka has drawn comparisons to the financial crisis in Lebanon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. Resolving the crisis requires coherent political leadership, debt restructuring, and a return to economic reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

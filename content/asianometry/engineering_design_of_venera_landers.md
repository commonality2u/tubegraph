The [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Soviet Union]] achieved a remarkable feat in the 1970s and 80s by successfully landing five probes on the surface of Venus, each surviving for over 30 minutes in an extremely hostile environment. No other nation has attempted a legitimate lander on Venus since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The engineering behind these [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera series]] missions was groundbreaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## [[challenges_of_landing_on_venus | Challenges of Landing on Venus]]

Venus is considered one of the hardest places to land in the Solar System, second only to the Sun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Often called Earth's "evil twin" due to similar size and proximity to Earth, its atmosphere is drastically different because of a runaway greenhouse effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Key environmental [[challenges_of_landing_on_venus | challenges]] include:
*   **Extreme Heat**: The surface temperature reaches 864 degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius), hotter than Mercury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Immense Pressure**: Surface pressure is equivalent to being over 0.5 miles (1 kilometer) underwater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Corrosive Atmosphere**: Clouds are made of sulfuric acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Atmospheric Entry Heating**: Friction during entry can heat a probe to 11,000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Early Venera Missions (Venera 4, 5, 6)

By 1967, the [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Soviets]] had experienced eleven failures in their Venus launch attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The goal of the [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera project]] (Venera means Venus in Russian) was to land a probe on the Venusian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. After [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 3]] failed, the mission was transferred to the aerospace company Lavochkin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Venera 4
*   **Design**: A hefty probe, 11 feet (3.5 meters) tall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Its bottom lander consisted of instruments and a battery enclosed in a pressure shell with a parachute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Entry**: Reached Venus in October 1967, releasing its lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Entry temperatures hit 11,000 degrees Celsius and forces reached 450G <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: Transmitted atmospheric data, showing rapidly rising temperatures and pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. It was crushed 93 minutes into the mission, 27 kilometers above the surface, at 22 atmospheres and 530 degrees Fahrenheit (277 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This data, combined with information from the American Mariner 5, revealed Venus to be far more hostile than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Venera 5 and 6
*   **Modifications**: Due to time constraints for the 1969 launch window, major changes were impossible for [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 5]] and [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 6]]. Engineers could only strengthen the landing probes minimally, deferring radical redesigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 5]] transmitted for 53 minutes before succumbing to 27 atmospheres and 600 degrees Fahrenheit (320 degrees Celsius) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 6]] lasted 51 minutes, descending 37.8 kilometers before being crushed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Venera 7 and 8: Reaching the Surface

For the 1970 launch window, [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Soviet]] engineers were determined to make it to the surface, now knowing the conditions: 840 degrees Fahrenheit (450 degrees Celsius), 100 atmospheres, and corrosive acid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Key Engineering Enhancements:
*   **Pressure Resistance**: Engineers consulted submarine designers and sourced new, stronger materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. A hotter, stronger test chamber was used for testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Faster Descent**: The parachute was modified to make the lander fall faster, maximizing surface time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. A restricting cord would melt at 390 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), allowing the parachute to fully open for a soft landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Structural Design**: The lander was egg-shaped, made of smooth titanium with minimal ports, welds, or sub-structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Internal Protection**: The inside was lined with shock absorbers and an unknown insulation layer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. The chamber would be pre-chilled to freezing temperatures before entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Venera 7
*   **Landing**: Reached Venus in December 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The parachute worked initially, but 6 minutes into stage 2, it melted or tore, causing the probe to drop like a rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. It hit the ground unexpectedly at 35 miles per hour (60 kilometers per hour) at 4:42 AM Venus solar time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Survival**: The lander bounced, misaligning its antenna and weakening its signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Despite initial beliefs it was destroyed, radio astronomers later rediscovered a weak signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 7]] transmitted data for 23 minutes on the surface in temperatures hot enough to melt zinc or lead before its shell cracked and it melted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Venera 8**: Launched two years later in 1972, [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 8]] had a similar design and also successfully landed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## Venera 9 and 10: Photography Missions

By 1975, the [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Soviets]] launched the next generation of [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera probes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Now understanding the Venusian environment, engineers designed them for ambitious tasks, primarily to send back the first ever photographic panoramas of the Venusian surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Significant Design Overhaul:
*   **Increased Size**: New rockets allowed for much bigger probes. [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 9]] and [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 10]] were five times heavier than predecessors, weighing 5 tons (5,000 kilograms) at launch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Orbiter and Lander**: Each mission had both an orbiter and a lander component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Entry Capsule**: A spherical capsule covered in an asbestos composite entered the atmosphere, absorbed heat, and then split in half to eject the lander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Lander Structure**: The 6.5-foot (2-meter) tall lander was a hermetically sealed titanium sphere, 2.6 feet (80 centimeters) wide, with peripherals attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
    *   **Sealing**: Bolted together with gold wire seals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
    *   **Internal Cooling**: Shelves made of beryllium and electric fans evenly dispersed heat inside to prevent instrument failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
    *   **Insulation**: The sphere's inside was lined with a forgotten type of polyurethane foam, then wrapped in 5 inches (12 centimeters) of honeycomb composite insulation, and finally another layer of titanium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Shock Absorption**: A shock-absorbing ring was placed on the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Aerobrake System**: A titanium disk on top, resembling a hat, served as an aerobrake, replacing the problematic two-stage parachute design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The parachute detached entirely at 30 miles (50 kilometers) above the surface, with the aerobrake handling the rest of the descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. This system was tested by throwing it out of an airplane from 8.7 miles (14 kilometers) above ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Cameras**: Two cameras were positioned in the middle of the lander with "goldfish bowl lenses" and protected by special pressure windows made of pure quartz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Image data (512x128 pixels) was sent at one line every 3.5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Expected Lifespan**: Scientists estimated the probe would last about an hour on the surface, with half an hour required to send a full panorama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### Outcomes:
*   **Landing**: Both [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 9]] and [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 10]] arrived in late October 1975, cutting their parachutes at 50 kilometers and landing at around 15 miles (25 kilometers) per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Photography**: One camera on [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 9]] successfully transmitted the first-ever picture of the Venusian surface, revealing sharp rocks, soil, and a distant horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 10]] landed on a rolling plain with older, hardened magma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
*   **Transmission Duration**: Both probes transmitted for 50-60 minutes until their orbiters moved out of range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Internal temperatures were about 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius), suggesting they could have lasted longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## Venera 11-14: Refinements and Challenges

The success of [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 9]] and [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 10]] led to a demand for sequels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

*   **Venera 11 and 12**: These probes performed interesting science, but their cameras were disabled by a mysterious electrical anomaly, leading to their missions being largely forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   **Venera 13 and 14**: Launched in 1982, these missions refined the principles of [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 9]] and [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | 10]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
    *   **Improvements**: Engineers improved cameras and scientific instruments, added new heat-resistant technologies, and guaranteed a minimum survival time of 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. They could also take color images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
    *   **External Sensors**: Many sensors and instruments could now be mounted *outside* the spherical pressure chamber. These were made of platinum and covered in acid-resistant enamel, a testament to the engineers' advanced understanding of the Venusian environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Results**:
    *   [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 13]] landed as planned, taking black and white and then color photos. The images showed pebbled, loose soil amidst bedrock, resembling an ocean floor, with an orange sky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
    *   [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 14]] showed a more weathered plain with fine-grained rock and less loose soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Famously, its drill landed exactly on its lens cap, preventing sample collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
    *   **Audio**: Both probes carried microphones, capturing sounds like lens caps blowing off, the drill operating, and a gentle wind with faint hints of distant rumblings, presumed to be Venus-quakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

## Legacy of Venera Engineering

The [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera series]] culminated with [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera 15]] and [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | 16]] in the 1980s, which swapped out landers for radar to map Venusian topography from orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. These were the last [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera landers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

While space programs shifted focus to the Moon and Mars, the [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera series]] stands as a testament to the engineering prowess of the [[challenges_faced_in_soviet_space_program | Soviet space program]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. The fact that the Soviets achieved these landings with decades-old technology proves it is possible to send another lander back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. The [[future_potential_of_venus_exploration | future potential of Venus exploration]] with landers would require significant advancements in cooling technologies to allow for weeks of survival on the surface, rather than mere hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

The secret work done during the [[challenges_faced_in_soviet_space_program | Soviet era]] for the [[soviet_venera_missions_to_venus | Venera series]] is now largely lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. However, recent developments in extreme environment technologies might make a return trip feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

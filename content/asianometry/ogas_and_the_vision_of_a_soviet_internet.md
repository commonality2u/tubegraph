In the 1960s, as the Soviet economy faced stagnation and a desperate need for reform, a radical idea emerged: a single nationwide computer network [00:00:02]. This system, known as OGAS (from the Russian "Obshchegosudarstvennaya Avtomatizirovannaya Sistema"), was intended to autonomously gather and process data from all the country's factories and issue production commands as needed [00:00:10]. Envisioned as the "nervous system for an entire nation," OGAS aimed to usher in a new tech-led future for the Soviet Union, but this vision never materialized [00:00:18].

## Context: The Soviet Command Economy

For much of its history, the Soviet Union operated a command economy where the state owned everything and economic activity was coordinated through directives, quotas, and commands rather than a free market [00:02:21]. Key state entities included:
*   **Gosplan (State Planning Commission)**: Responsible for writing five-year plans and defining economic inputs, including prices [00:02:51].
*   **Gossnab (State Commission for Materials and Equipment Supplier)**: Implemented plans by procuring and supplying producer goods to factories [00:03:00].
*   **Gosbank**: Handled accounting and recorded transactions [00:02:44].

While this system initially facilitated rapid growth and technological achievements, particularly in military and aerospace, it struggled with central planning behind the scenes [00:03:10]. Issues included immense paperwork, distorted incentives, frequent miscommunications, and quotas often being met only through informal "pushers" or fixers [00:03:22]. Attempts at reform frequently led to an increase in bureaucracy [00:03:54].

## The Rise of Cybernetics

Following Stalin's death in 1953, a new era of reforms began under Nikita Khrushchev [00:04:00]. One significant reform was the normalization and adoption of cybernetics [00:04:19]. At the 20th Congress of the Communist Party in 1956, Khrushchev praised cybernetics as "one of the major tools of the creation of a communist Society" [00:04:23]. This encouraged the development of computer science and industrial automation [00:04:42].

Cybernetics, originated by Norbert Wiener in the United States, had been banned during Stalin's reign due to its assertions about information as a substance and analogies between the brain's neurons and computer signals, which encroached on established Russian psychological theories [00:04:48]. Khrushchev's reversal allowed cybernetics to flourish, becoming a project to introduce mathematical methods to life and social sciences, giving it an "aura of Truth and objectivity" [00:05:09]. Soviet leaders became captivated by the idea that computers could offer a universal method for problem-solving and aid the ailing economy [00:05:37].

### Influence of American Developments

In 1958, news of the American Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) system reached the Soviet Union [00:05:50]. SAGE, a groundbreaking air defense system, coordinated radar data to create a unified image of America's airspace, powered by what was then the largest computer ever built [00:05:59]. Its development and classified capabilities alarmed Soviet military planners [00:06:31]. In response, the Soviets initiated efforts to independently build three centralized computer networks focusing on air defense, missile defense, and space surveillance [00:06:37]. The air defense network, known as System A, connected two Soviet supercomputers (the M40 and M50 built in 1958 and 1959) and led to Khrushchev's boast in 1962 that its prototype could "hit a fly in outer space" [00:06:49]. This military endeavor demonstrated the potential of networked computers for civilian applications [00:07:07].

### Early Advocacy by Anatoli Kitov

Anatoli Kitov, a war hero and one of the Soviet Union's early pioneers in cybernetics, proposed the first effort to network the nation in 1958 [00:07:16]. Kitov, who studied math and physics during the war, became a rocket scientist before discovering Norbert Wiener's book [00:07:25]. He concluded that cybernetics was a valuable tool for the Soviet Union and authored the country's first significant positive article on the subject, "The Main Features of Cybernetics" [00:07:40]. He later founded and headed one of the country's first computing centers [00:07:57].

In 1956, Kitov wrote a book about how computers could help model and regulate the Soviet economy, suggesting they could replace existing tabulating machines [00:08:05]. This idea gained acceptance, and in January 1959, Kitov wrote to the Communist Party Central Committee, urging the adoption of computers for economic planning [00:08:20]. This first letter likely proposed a "Unified State Network of Computing Centers" [00:08:38]. While Khrushchev might not have seen it, government officials supported his proposals, leading to a resolution for "the speeding and widening of the production of calculation machines and their application to the National economy" [00:08:50].

Buoyed by this success, Kitov sent another letter in the autumn of 1959, proposing the installation of large computers at local factories and government agencies, linked together into "automated systems of management" (ASUs) [00:09:09]. His ultimate vision was a "unified automated management system" (EASU) for the entire nation, military and civilian, run by powerful military computers buried underground and accessible via terminals for civilians to use [00:09:34]. Kitov believed this system would maximize the command economy's centralized advantages and lead to immense financial savings by replacing the existing bureaucracy [00:10:06].

However, this "red letter" also criticized the Ministry of Defense's slow adoption of computers and suggested sharing military technology with civilians [00:10:21]. The military did not appreciate these criticisms or the idea of sharing its technology [00:10:36]. Kitov consequently faced a show trial, losing his job, Communist Party membership, and military honors, though he was not executed [00:10:55]. He spent the rest of his days advocating for a networked Soviet future [00:11:09].

## The OGAS Vision Under Victor Glushkov

Despite Kitov's setback, the concept of national networking persisted [00:11:15]. In 1962, Soviet cyberneticist Alexander Kharkevich proposed a national unified communications network [00:11:37]. Another prominent figure was Victor Glushkov, head of the Kiev Institute of Cybernetics [00:11:51]. Glushkov sought to implement the ASUs that Kitov had detailed, even hiring Kitov as a consultant [00:11:57].

In late 1962, Glushkov wrote to Khrushchev, highlighting the growing [[comparison_between_soviet_networking_ambitions_and_western_advancements_like_arpanet|technology gap with the West]] and advocating for accelerated Soviet computerization [00:12:10]. In 1963, the Soviet leadership approved research into economic reform using these automated computer networks (ASUs) [00:12:23]. These ASUs allowed mainframe computers to receive and process industrial data from factories, akin to local network factory automation [00:12:35]. Glushkov's team studied such systems throughout the early 1960s, even successfully controlling a steel smelting factory 300 miles away and a carbonization process 400 miles away from a computer system in Kiev [00:12:46].

Glushkov's ambitions extended beyond factory automation, leading to the emergence of OGAS [00:13:16]. The full name of OGAS was the "All-State Automated System for the Management of the Economy," which further stood for "All-State Automated System for the Gathering and Processing of Information for the Accounting, Planning, and Governance of the National Economy USSR" [00:13:25].

### The Ambitious Plan

As conceived in the early 1960s, OGAS was a highly ambitious, three-tiered hierarchical system [00:13:43]:
1.  **First Tier**: Approximately 20,000 computer terminals and ASUs at the local level [00:13:50].
2.  **Second Tier**: 100 to 200 mid-level regional planning decision systems [00:13:56].
3.  **Third Tier**: Rolled up to a central planner in Moscow [00:14:01].

Glushkov even envisioned the computerization of currencies and money flows, proposing a moneyless system of receipts over the network, likely to appeal to Khrushchev's Marxist ideals, though he was advised to drop this controversial element [00:14:06].

The vision driving OGAS was to create a single computer network that could rationally and automatically plan, optimize, and manage the country's national economy as dictated by the Party Center [00:14:39]. It aimed to precisely plan the workdays and weeks of Soviet bureaucrats, providing detailed lists of duties, timetables, chains of responsibility, and even document arrangement [00:14:51]. The concept was analogous to a nervous system for the Soviet Union, connecting the "brain" (leadership) with the "body" (factories and workers) to ensure coordinated output and overcome bureaucratic inefficiencies [00:15:06]. This system would have been the Soviet counterpoint to the Western capitalist view of a self-regulating market economy, using computers to gather historical information for rational forecasts and production [00:15:33].

## Why OGAS Failed

The ambitious version of OGAS, first presented in 1964, never fully developed due to several key factors:

### Cost
The most significant obstacle was the astronomical cost [00:15:48]. The original vision, with its thousands of computer centers and three tiers, was estimated to take 30 years to implement and cost a "stupefying" 160 billion rubles, equivalent to about 1.4 trillion USD in 2016 dollars [00:15:56]. This amount exceeded the combined budgets of both the [[comparison_of_soviet_and_american_space_programs|Soviet space]] and atomic bomb programs [00:16:16].

### Technological Limitations
While the Soviet military possessed [[soviet_versus_western_computing_capabilities|world-leading computer capabilities]] for networks with nationwide coverage and message switching, civilian computer technology in the Soviet Union lagged far behind [00:16:24]. The military was highly unwilling to transfer its specialized, custom technologies to civilian use [00:16:39].

### Bureaucratic Resistance and Infighting
[[challenges_and_bureaucratic_infighting_in_implementing_soviet_internet|Various players and power centers objected to OGAS]], fearing that they might be replaced or have their work dictated by a computer [00:16:50]. This included Communist Party bureaucrats, Gosplan, and industrial managers [00:16:59]. In particular, people within the Central Statistical Administration recognized that the computers' "objective collection of data" would curb their power to control the flow of information [00:17:05].

Furthermore, Glushkov's plans were "all or nothing"; he argued that none of its benefits could be realized if it was not delivered in whole, requiring a complete reformation of the country's management system—a "revolution" [00:17:18].

## Later Attempts and Final Outcome

The year 1964 also saw Khrushchev lose power, replaced by Leonid Brezhnev, who reversed many of his predecessor's economic reforms [00:17:32]. However, the directive for economic restructuring via computer remained on the agenda due to high-level backing [00:17:46]. Despite this, Gosplan and the Central Statistical Administration strongly rejected OGAS's utopian vision, engaging in bureaucratic infighting to control its resources and shape the project [00:17:56]. If OGAS was to be implemented, it had to conform to the existing "Soviet way of doing things" [00:18:10].

In 1969, widespread news of ARPANET, the predecessor to today's internet, caught the Soviet leadership by surprise [00:18:23]. This competitive factor spurred the OGAS project forward [00:18:33]. With ARPANET in mind, Glushkov revised OGAS into a "universal information Bank" that would accumulate and move information between various national agencies [00:18:39]. Instead of running and controlling the entire economy, this new OGAS would only organize and control data flows, like a system of canals managing water flow between reservoirs [00:18:52].

At a momentous meeting on October 1, 1970, Glushkov presented his revised OGAS to the Politburo [00:19:11]. Several high-ranking officials spoke positively, and hardliners did not voice opposition [00:19:22]. However, the Ministry of Finance, led by Vasili Garbazov, interceded [00:19:41]. Recognizing OGAS's potential to command immense political gravity and erode his ministry's power, Garbazov dismissed it as a "silly project" and proposed a much more conservative counter-proposal, which won over the Politburo [00:19:47].

In the end, the full OGAS proposal was neither fully accepted nor rejected [00:20:06]. Throughout the 1970s, some ASUs were built in individual factories, with estimates ranging from a hundred (1971-1985) to thousands [00:20:14]. However, these ASUs were built haphazardly and without adherence to common standards, making networking them impossible [00:20:32]. The nationwide United Network of ASUs, as Glushkov envisioned, never materialized [00:20:39].

The failure of the Soviet internet was primarily due to [[challenges_and_bureaucratic_infighting_in_implementing_soviet_internet|bureaucratic infighting]], as various leaders and power centers objected to its capabilities and manipulated the project for their own ends [00:20:43]. The fundamental reason, however, was that Glushkov's vision challenged the very way the Soviet Union was run [00:20:55].

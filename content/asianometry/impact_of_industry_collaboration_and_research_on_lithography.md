[[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML's rise]] in the photolithography industry is significantly attributed to its strong engagement in industry collaboration and research, a factor where its Japanese competitors, Nikon and Canon, struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

## ASML's Collaborative Advantage

The "ASML-Philips-Zeiss" block benefited from close ties to critical industry research centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:00">[11:19:00]</a>.

### Role of IMEC
ASML's success is partly due to its close relationship with IMEC, a semi-governmental nonprofit in Belgium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. IMEC is one of Europe's most advanced semiconductor research centers, working closely with both industry and academia to develop new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

IMEC also plays a crucial role in facilitating cross-industry collaboration, helping various companies within the semiconductor industry to work together on new standards and ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. This exposure enabled ASML to understand how their tools were used by customers and how they interacted with equipment from other vendors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>.

### Joint Publications
Even without IMEC's direct participation, ASML demonstrated its collaborative nature through numerous joint papers published by the ASML-Philips-Zeiss group with chipmakers, toolmakers, and chemical manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.

### Strategic Outsourcing
ASML's decision to outsource all of its optics R&D and research to Zeiss allowed it to look beyond mere optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. This enabled ASML to find new opportunities to optimize the performance of their tools, leading to superior products that better met customer needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. Examples include optimizing the use of new chemicals in photoresist and photomasks, and the development of the two-stage wafer processing in the Twinscan system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.

## Nikon and Canon's Collaborative Shortcomings

In contrast, Nikon and Canon lacked a similar collaborating body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. A review of Nikon's published papers indicated that most were self-authored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.

While Japanese companies did exchange information with outside partners, this was typically limited to long-term collaborators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. Furthermore, these exchanges were often suboptimal, with customers primarily communicating problems rather than ideas for improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>.

### Historical Context of Collaboration
Nikon and Canon initially gained their market-leading position in the 1980s due to a similar resource-sharing initiative: the VLSI research project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. However, this collaboration was government-mandated, forcing competitors to work together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>. After this project, no equally effective collaborative structure emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>.

### Weak Industry-Academia Ties
Ties between industry and academia in Japan are notably weaker compared to Western counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>. Japanese industry professionals are cautious about disclosing trade secrets to universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. Additionally, professors in Japanese universities tend to focus more on basic science and concepts, lacking strong incentives to see their work applied in industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.

This weakness had direct consequences, notably during the development of [[challenges_in_semiconductor_lithography | immersion lithography]]. While Taiwanese scientist Bern Lin discovered the theoretical pathway, key breakthroughs for a practical commercial system came from an American researcher at MIT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. This researcher conducted experiments using industry-standard conditions, a process that requires meeting with industry professionals and understanding their operational methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>.

Japanese universities began reforms in the mid-2000s, establishing technology licensing organizations (TLOs) to gain patent revenue from discoveries, similar to institutions like MIT, Stanford, and Berkeley <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
While many theories attempt to explain [[asmls_rise_in_the_photolithography_industry | ASML's rise]] and the decline of Japanese lithography leaders, the differing approaches to industry collaboration and research played a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of paying close attention to generational shifts in technology, as these are moments when industry leadership can change hands dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.

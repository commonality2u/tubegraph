Carlos Ghosn, known as "Le Cost Killer," played a pivotal role in Nissan's history, leading its turnaround and shaping its global strategy for nearly two decades before his dramatic downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. His leadership saw Nissan rise to profitability, but also led to strategies that some considered unhealthy and contributed to simmering tensions within the Renault-Nissan Alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Nissan's story has been characterized by significant ups and downs, with its latest downturn potentially leading to a [[nissans_proposed_merger_with_honda | merger with Honda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Turnaround (1999-2002)
In 1999, Carlos Ghosn, then Renault's number two executive, was asked to join Nissan as its new COO to turn the company around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Renault invested 5 billion euros into the struggling Japanese carmaker for a 36.8% stake in Nissan's shares, with an option for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. At the time, Nissan was burdened by excessive global expansion, foreign assimilation, and lax management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Its factories were underutilized (only 53% utilization), few of its 40+ car lines were profitable, and workers were unproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Many observers believed Nissan was "done" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Ghosn and his team implemented aggressive changes over the next two years:
*   **Cost Cutting and Debt Reduction** They ruthlessly cut costs and paid off debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Simplification** The company's complex portfolio of cross-stock holdings, including 1,300 companies that were part of the same business family (Keiretsu), was simplified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Supplier Reduction** Nissan's sprawling web of suppliers was halved, as many had been charging inflated prices due to "family" relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. These efforts yielded at least $2.25 billion in savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Employee Incentives and Job Cuts** Ghosn elevated younger talent over those based on seniority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. His revival plan also cut 21,000 jobs through attrition and shut down five factories, a move culturally vexing in Japan but argued as necessary to remove "cruft," such as "ghost jobs" held by former senior managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Brand Revival** To soothe egos, Ghosn brought back classic cars like the Z-series and GT-R <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

By 2002, Nissan returned to profitability, ahead of schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Continuing Success and Alliance Building
Ghosn's success brought him international fame, including being named Industry Leader of the Year by Automotive News for three consecutive years, and even becoming the subject of a Japanese manga <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. He declined an offer to run General Motors during its crisis in the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

The Renault-Nissan Alliance deepened, with Renault raising its stake in Nissan to 43% in 2002, and Nissan acquiring a 15% stake in Renault (without equivalent voting capacity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. In 2005, Ghosn became CEO of Renault while retaining his position at Nissan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

Under Ghosn, Nissan achieved its 2002 three-year plan goals, selling a million more cars per year and maintaining strong operating margins of 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This performance was boosted by a strong U.S. market for Pathfinder SUVs and Altima passenger cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Declaring Nissan's recovery complete, he immediately announced another 3-year plan, "value up," aiming for another million cars in annual sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

### Expansion into China
A core part of Ghosn's growth strategy was tapping into the booming Chinese automotive market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   In 2000, Nissan set up Fengshen Auto (風神, or "wind god"), a joint venture (JV) with state-owned Dongfeng Motor and two other car companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Fengshen produced Chinese variants of Nissan's Bluebird car and generated 2 billion RMB in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   This success led to a deeper 50-50 partnership negotiated by Ghosn in 2002 to produce passenger cars and trucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   Initially, the new JV faced challenges, with Chinese workers in production and Japanese in sales, leading to a 10% sales decrease in 2004 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Restructuring aligned the teams to their proper order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   In 2005, Dongfeng Nissan's sales surged 160%, making it the fastest-growing carmaker in China that year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>, remaining a top-10 carmaker for several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## [[challenges_faced_by_nissan_in_the_2000s_and_2010s | Challenges Faced by Nissan in the 2000s and 2010s]]
Nissan faced short-term shocks like the Global Financial Crisis (2008-2009), which saw sales fall 22% and a $2.9 billion net loss in 2009, leading to job cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. The devastating March 2011 earthquake also damaged factories and halted supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

Ghosn correctly foresaw major long-term industry developments, such as rising R&D costs due to tightening safety and environmental regulations, which necessitated selling more cars for a good return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. He believed carmaker consolidation could help share these costs and that the Renault-Nissan alliance, with six million annual units sold, had the potential to compete with giants like VW, Toyota, or GM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. His goal for the alliance was about 10 million cars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

In 2011, Ghosn announced a plan to raise Nissan's global market share from 5.8% to 8% and increase operating margins by selling more in Japan, China, and the United States, aiming for 10% share in those markets by 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

### Unhealthy Growth Strategies
To meet ambitious targets, Nissan adopted strategies that were "arguably unhealthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>:
*   **Deep Discounts** Nissan offered deep discounts, averaging 16.7% by 2018, higher than the industry's 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Dealer Incentives** "Stair step" incentives rewarded dealers with large cash bonuses for hitting ambitious sales quotas but nothing if they fell short, leading to desperate or disgruntled dealers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This was internally called "grow or go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Fleet Sales** Selling more cars to rental fleets disrupted the resale value of Nissan models for other consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

These actions prioritized "growth at all costs," damaging brand value, annoying dealers, and worrying consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

### Missed Opportunities
Nissan's product lineup also stagnated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. While American tastes shifted towards SUVs and trucks, Nissan's core sedan lines fell out of favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. High-potential products often fizzled out:
*   **Nissan Titan** Introduced in 2003 as a challenge to Ford and GM's profit centers, the Titan was tough to manufacture, its look became stale, and sales fell short of Ghosn's target of 100,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Nissan Leaf** An EV pioneer touted by Ghosn, its execution was lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Development efforts were duplicated with Renault's ZOE EV, with little commonality, even for batteries, leading to lost time and momentum and resulting in expensive cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **Self-Driving Technology** Ghosn predicted Nissan cars would be self-driving by 2020, but execution was lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### Simmering Tensions within the Alliance
Ghosn's drive for consolidation led to closer ties between Renault and Nissan, moving beyond purchasing to manufacturing collaboration, such as a plant in India in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. He forced engineers to collaborate by cutting individual budgets and appointed managers with responsibilities in both companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. He also aimed for 70% of the Alliance's cars to be made from one of three platforms by 2020, through the Renault-Nissan Common Module Family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

However, these efforts "ran into troubles, touching the simmering cultural and geopolitical tensions inside the Alliance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Japanese engineers bristled at the perceived loss of car identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Nissan also perceived an uneven arrangement, with Renault holding voting power over Nissan but not vice versa, and believed Nissan was increasingly propping up Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. The French government's increased stake in Renault in 2015 further threatened Nissan, leading to a "kerfuffle" and an agreement not to interfere in Nissan's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

## Ghosn's Downfall and Aftermath
Carlos Ghosn's long tenure (nearly twenty years), his "jet-setting life" and high compensation led to his downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. In 2010, his reported compensation of $9.6 million in cash and stock was significantly higher than other Nissan executives and even Toyota's chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

The proximate cause of his downfall was the discovery by internal auditors that Nissan had purchased residences in Lebanon and Brazil for Ghosn's personal use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. In November 2018, Ghosn was arrested in Japan, stripped of his positions, and charged with underreporting his income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. He claimed innocence, was released on bail, and famously fled to Lebanon in a daring escape in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. The SEC alleged he and his team concealed $140 million in compensation, with all parties settling in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.

[[management_and_strategic_changes_at_nissan_postghosn | Management and strategic changes at Nissan postGhosn]] involved a period of struggle following his abrupt departure, compounded by a leadership vacuum when his successor, Hiroto Saikawa, also resigned due to stock pay violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. From 2019 to 2021, Nissan cut more jobs, closed factories, dialed down incentives and fleet sales, and reset dealer relations, taking a sizable revenue loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. A major goal was to reset the unequal shareholding relationship with Renault, a complex process filled with internal infighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. The final deal in 2023 trimmed Renault's stake in Nissan to 15% and gave Nissan voting rights for its 15% in Renault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

For a long time, two companies dominated the silver-based photographic film industry: Eastman Kodak and Fujifilm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. After decades of [[historical_rivalry_and_competition_between_fujifilm_and_kodak | clashing for dominance]], digital photography suddenly emerged, annihilating the traditional film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Fujifilm saw this coming and, amazingly, emerged from the [[key_differences_in_strategies_between_fujifilm_and_kodak_during_digital_transition | digital transition]] as a larger but transformed company, while Kodak did not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Founding and Early Emphasis on Technology

Fujifilm was founded in 1934 as a subsidiary of Dai Nippon Celluloid Company, Japan's first cinematic film manufacturer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Dai Nippon had initially approached Kodak, but its founder, George Eastman, declined to build a factory in Japan due to concerns about the humid climate for film production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. In response, Dai Nippon, with Japanese government support, started Fuji Photo Film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Unlike competitors, Fujifilm decided to produce its photographic film internally rather than importing it, hiring a German emulsion specialist for technical expertise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This focus on developing their own technology, despite the initial difficulties, became a key part of their culture and strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Fujifilm is known for spending more than its peers on research and development (R&D) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

The company researched color photography film shortly before World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Producing color film, which consists of about 20 overlapping, evenly coated layers of functional particles, requires near [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | semiconductor]] quality control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Fujifilm completed its color film product in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Market Competition and Strategic Foothold

Around the time Japan reopened its markets to foreign competitors, including Kodak, the [[historical_rivalry_and_competition_between_fujifilm_and_kodak | rivalry between Kodak and Fujifilm]] intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Initially, Fujifilm was significantly smaller than Kodak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Although Fujifilm enjoyed preferential treatment in its domestic market with import quotas and tariffs, Japanese consumers still preferred Kodak as a superior brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

However, Fujifilm narrowed the technical proficiency gap, with its films outperforming Kodak's in certain technical areas by 1970, such as requiring less light for color films <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Fujifilm leveraged this technical prowess to secure its niche in the Japanese high-end prosumer and professional photography space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

A crucial part of their strategy involved rolling out a mini-lab retail push, allowing third parties to provide speedy one-hour film development, which created a powerful network with first-mover advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. By 1994, there were 13,400 mini-labs in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Kodak's [[challenges_and_failures_in_kodaks_diversification_attempts | botched Japanese market entry strategy]], which outsourced marketing to a third party that primarily cut prices, resulted in Kodak occupying the low-end space in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

In the United States, Fujifilm started selling under its own brand in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. While unable to break into the drugstore market loyal to Kodak, Fujifilm found success in American supermarkets and later in the niche movie and professional photographer spaces by heavily focusing on technical quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. They sponsored major sporting leagues like the NBA and the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. By 1995, Fujifilm held 13% market share in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Recognizing the Digital Threat

Both Kodak and Fujifilm long recognized that digital imaging was the future, producing many of their own digital imaging technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Fujifilm's diversified business provided early warnings about the impending digital shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. In 1981, Fujifilm released a product for diagnostic x-ray imaging that replaced x-ray film with a photosensitive plate, leading to the Fuji Computed Radiography product in 1983, which is still used today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

The digitization of plate making for publications also signaled the decline of film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Shigataka Komori, a sales manager at the time and future CEO, began worrying about a future where film was no longer needed at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Fujifilm realized that the hard work and specialized technologies developed for film would become irrelevant with image digitization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

In 1980, Fujifilm appointed Minoru Onishi as its new president, who introduced a three-pronged strategy to address this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>:
1.  **Pioneer Digital Imaging Technologies:** Similar to Kodak's early efforts, Fujifilm aimed to develop its own digital imaging sensors, releasing its first digital camera, the Fujifilm DS-1P, in 1988 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
2.  **Milk the Analog Cash Cow:** By improving the quality of film images, Fujifilm sought to prolong the life of its core business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
3.  **Build New Business Lines:** The company needed to establish businesses entirely outside of digital photography or analog photographic film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Diversification Efforts Prior to Digital Collapse

In the mid-1980s, Fujifilm began investing in various diversifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Some were peripheral to their core photography business, like inkjet and optical disk technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Others were developed based on the core technologies used in photographic film manufacturing, such as cancer pharmaceuticals, in concert with a Nobel Prize-winning scientist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

Despite these efforts, the success of their core business in the 1980s, including popular products like the 1986 Fujifilm QuickSnap disposable camera, created inertia, leading to excuses against rapid diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Film sales were sky-high, generating over $600 million USD in operating profits in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

## Vision 75: Strategic Reforms and New Growth (Post-2000)

By 2001, global demand for color film began declining rapidly, at 20-30% per year, largely due to the widespread proliferation of the CMOS image sensor, particularly in mobile phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

In 2004, with its core business imploding, CEO Shigataka Komori announced "Vision 75," a medium-term plan named for the company's forthcoming 75th anniversary in 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This plan aimed to guide Fujifilm beyond its roots towards new success and had three steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>:

### Step 1: Implement Strategic Reforms
Fujifilm, with 15,000 employees in large film factories globally, faced expensive infrastructure no longer affordable by the shrinking business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Starting in 2006, Fujifilm spent $1.8 billion cutting jobs, closing factories, and canceling sales partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. Unlike its domestic competitor Konica, which exited the photography business entirely, Komori never considered leaving the film business, believing Fujifilm's mission was to "preserve and sustain the culture of Photography" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Fujifilm still produces film today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

### Step 2: Find New Profitable Growth Businesses
While Fujifilm had a good position in digital cameras, they quickly learned it was a terrible business, as the profit was always in selling film, not the camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Photographic film once provided 60% of Fuji's sales and two-thirds of its profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Digital cameras could not replace this, leading Fujifilm to transition into entirely new markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

Many of these new markets grew out of the technology behind their film business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>:

*   **Fujitec (TAC Film):** Color film is made of multiple photosensitive layers on a base. In the 1950s, Fujifilm produced TAC (triacetate celluloids) for its bases, which were highly transparent with smooth surfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Fujifilm started selling TAC to industries ranging from electrical insulation to anime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. The product found significant footing in the [[innovation_and_challenges_in_sharps_lcd_business | LCD]] industry in the 1980s, where it was used as a protective covering for [[innovation_and_challenges_in_sharps_lcd_business | LCD]] screens and polarizing layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. By the 2000s, Fujitec had become a billion-dollar business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

Inspired by Fujitec's success, Fujifilm reviewed all its laboratory technologies and, after a year, identified six priority businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>:

*   **Digital Imaging:** Producing high-end digital cameras and related products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.
*   **Optical Devices:** Known as Fujinon, this business produces lenses for broadcast television, security cameras, and similar applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   **Specialty Chemicals/Materials:** Building on the Fujitec business, Fujifilm's specialty lines serve industries such as solar panels, touch panels, and [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | semiconductor]] industries, even producing [[role_of_technology_and_innovation_in_lithography | photoresists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   **Graphics:** Items for digital printing, including the company's in-house inkjet technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Documents:** Printers and office copier solutions for businesses, largely dominated by the Fuji Xerox joint venture (now Fujifilm Business Innovation), which accounted for 30% of total revenue in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Business:** Fujifilm's diversification into healthcare is considered the ultimate expression of its commitment to survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.
    *   Beyond its early x-ray film products, Fujifilm also sold endoscopes, ultrasonic devices, and healthcare imaging systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.
    *   Starting in 1996, Fujifilm significantly increased its patent applications for pharmaceutical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.
    *   They began producing skincare cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and dietary supplements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. This seemingly random diversification had significant crossover with photography film production:
        *   **Emulsions:** Knowledge of suspending one substance in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
        *   **Oxidation:** The process of aging photos and chemicals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.
        *   **Collagen:** A major ingredient of gelatin, a substance used for making film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.
    *   Fujifilm leveraged these existing expertises for new market applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>, augmenting its R&D with selective acquisitions, including several medical imaging companies in 2006 and Toyama Chemical in 2008 for nearly $1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

## Outcome

For its 2008 fiscal year, Fujifilm reported its highest sales in history, approximately $27 billion USD, up 100% from 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. By 2008, Fujifilm was a far more diversified company, with imaging products (like digital cameras) decreasing from 54% to just 19% of company revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. From 2005 to 2010, Fujifilm's sales grew nearly 50%, a stark contrast to Kodak's decline during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

## Key Difference from Kodak's Strategy

Business schools have extensively studied Kodak's failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. While Kodak also shrank its film manufacturing business and cut jobs, it [[key_differences_in_strategies_between_fujifilm_and_kodak_during_digital_transition | could never move beyond the idea of selling film and providing photography services]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. Former CEO Colby Chandler tried diversifying into floppy disks, batteries, artificial snow, and pharmaceuticals, but his successors reversed these efforts, doubling down on imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. Notably, Kodak spun off its specialty chemical business (now Eastman Chemical, a $10 billion Fortune 500 company) and its healthcare division (including Bayer Aspirin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. Despite researching pharmaceuticals and medical equipment patents concurrently with Fujifilm, Kodak withdrew from these ventures in 1996, reaffirming itself as an "Imaging company" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

The fundamental [[key_differences_in_strategies_between_fujifilm_and_kodak_during_digital_transition | difference between the two]] seems to be that Kodak was primarily a consumer brand with a strong technology base, whereas Fujifilm began as a technology company that happened to sell to consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. When consumer businesses vanished, Fujifilm found it easier to revert to its technological roots and diversify, while Kodak could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. Both companies excelled at chemistry and manufacturing precision chemicals, but had no inherent expertise in [[comparison_of_semiconductor_manufacturing_strategies_between_companies | semiconductors]] or electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. Fujifilm recognized this and leveraged its chemical expertise to move into new businesses, retaining "film" in its name as an indicator of its technological origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. Kodak, conversely, remained stuck on its sinking ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

[[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] is a critical supplier of semiconductor lithography machinery for foundries like Intel and TSMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. TSMC's CEO stated they can make only 50 high-end [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | EUV lithography machines]] a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Without these machines, foundries cannot produce more 5nm chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] itself relies on thousands of suppliers to produce parts for its machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Coordinating and integrating these parts into a smooth-running machine is an immense challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This article details how [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] puts together centi-million dollar lithography machines and how [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] technology adds to this complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## ASML as a System Integrator

[[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] is a global, sprawling company, with its primary factory in the Netherlands and additional manufacturing and R&D sites in Connecticut and California <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Similar to Boeing and Airbus, [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] has evolved into a system integrator role. It selects, procures, and assembles outputs from different suppliers in its network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Its lithography machines, such as the TWINSCAN variety, are built from independent modules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Approximately 90% of the components that go into these modules are manufactured by 500-600 outside companies within [[asmls_quality_control_and_supply_chain_management | ASML's outsourced supplier network]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This reliance on an outsourced network differentiates [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] from competitors like Canon and Nikon, who tend to do more in-house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Global Supplier Distribution
*   300 suppliers are located in the Netherlands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   Another 100 are in other parts of Europe, predominantly Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   The remaining suppliers are largely in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Coordinating within this global network is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Just as TSMC depends on [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] for training and advice on product usage, [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] in turn relies heavily on its suppliers for expertise on how to best use their components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. An example is the [[partnership_between_carl_zeiss_and_asml | strategic alliance with German company Carl Zeiss AG]], which specializes in precision optics and produces critical lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Reasons for Outsourcing Strategy

While [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] occasionally acquires supplier companies to bring unique expertise in-house (e.g., Brion Technologies for computational lithography, and Cymer for lasers), for the most part, it prefers to maintain its system integrator role and outsource manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. There are several strategic reasons for this:

1.  **Access to Specialized Expertise**: [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] can acquire module components without needing to become world-class in manufacturing each specific part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. A single lithography stepper can incorporate over 1,600 individual components, with 200 being costly or time-consuming to procure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This allows [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] to maintain a big-picture view without focusing on the minutiae of individual components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
2.  **Flexibility and Adaptability**: Outsourcing provides [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] with the flexibility to adapt to changing technology trends, such as the shift to [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This prevents sunk costs from investing resources in now-defunct technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
3.  **Economic Value and Influence**: The system integrator role places [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] at the capstone of the entire enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, allowing it to interpret customer requirements and have final say on component integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This role offers the most economic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] is often its suppliers' most important customer, sometimes representing 50% or more of their revenues, which allows [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] to exercise strong influence over their operations and planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Many suppliers are too specialized to diversify away from [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Supplier Network in Action

The process begins when clients like Intel, Samsung, or TSMC plan their future customer and product demand, typically a year or more in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. They inform [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] of their machine purchase requests and desired delivery dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Clients choose from over 30 specific options, customizing the final product to their needs, meaning no two [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] machines are exactly alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

Once an order is confirmed, [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]]'s Supply Chain Planning Department creates a Master Production Schedule (MPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This MPS details production start and end dates, considering resource needs, workforce hours, component lead times, and customer deadlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Suppliers are then notified and issued purchase orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Assembly and Delivery Process
*   **Module Assembly (ASSY)**: Each machine consists of modules built independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Final Assembly (FASY)**: Modules are integrated together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Testing**: The machine is tested against internal benchmarks, and configurations may be made for performance improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Disassembly & Delivery**: Once [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] standards for performance and reliability are met, the machine is disassembled and packed for delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Over 80% of [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]]'s customers are in Asia, often requiring long flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Installation**: [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] technicians work with foundry technicians to install the device into a fab clean room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Post-Delivery Support and Quality Control

[[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] is responsible for the upkeep and service of its products, not just delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. [[asmls_partnerships_and_collaborations | ASML]] signs service contracts with its foundry customers that include uptime Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. These contracts can hold [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] financially liable for lost sales due to machine downtime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

To ensure high uptime, [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] offers 24/7 support with trained technicians and staff operating from local technology development and training sites in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the United States, and 16 other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Spare parts are kept at local service warehouses, with a central warehouse shipping parts that are not locally available within a target of 14 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Zero Defects Policy
[[asmls_quality_control_and_supply_chain_management | ASML]] maintains rigid quality control standards on its suppliers, adhering to a policy of "zero defects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Each part is closely inspected, and any potential defect leads to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Challenges and Considerations

[[asmls_quality_control_and_supply_chain_management | ASML]]'s supply chain involves balancing chaos and nervous tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Planners must account for rejected parts, potential disruptions, and transport issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. If a non-critical part is rejected or missing, workers might use a "dummy part" to stay on schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. However, a mission-critical part can halt production of an entire module <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] must meet deadlines, as foundries like TSMC cannot afford delays that impact customer product launches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

### Long Lead Times and High Costs
Some parts, particularly the lens and lasers, require significant lead times, often longer than the final product's lead time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. A single lens can take up to 40 weeks to produce, meaning work must begin far in advance of actual customer orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

[[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | EUV]] equipment costs approximately $150 million each, comparable to a Boeing airplane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Individual components and replacements often exceed a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### Impact of EUV Lithography
[[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography]] (EUV) is the most advanced lithography technology, expected to be more cost-effective for sub-10nm nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV lithography]] necessitated a revolutionary re-engineering of many traditional semiconductor fabbing principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]]'s entire supply chain had to be re-engineered from the bottom up to accommodate these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

A key challenge for [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV lithography]] was maintaining etching speed and avoiding yield defects despite the low reflectivity of [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] mirrors (less than 70%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. This required a powerful light source created by firing a CO2 laser at tin droplets to produce plasma and ultraviolet light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The use of droplets reduced tin debris and prevented contamination of light-collecting mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

Historically, pellicles (thin polymer films) were used in older lithography to prevent particles from creating shadows on wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. However, in the [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] world, traditional pellicles absorbed and weakened [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV]] light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Until [[asmls_future_technological_developments | ASML]] developed suitable pellicles, earlier generations of [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | EUV machines]] across the supply chain had to adhere to ultra-strict cleanliness standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. A particle as small as 52 nm could contaminate an [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | EUV]] supply component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Maintaining such cleanliness pushed technical limits, requiring new proprietary detectors at all supplier premises and particle flushing steps throughout the build process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. These challenges were a major reason for [[asml_and_the_commercialization_of_euv_lithography | EUV commercialization]] delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. (Note: Pellicles are now available for [[asml_and_highvolume_euv_systems | EUV machines]], which is expected to improve wafer yields and reduce cleaning needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.)

## Market Leadership

[[asmls_rise_in_the_lithography_industry | ASML]]'s market leadership is defined by two key factors:

1.  **Technological Superiority**: [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] products are twice as expensive as competitors like Nikon or Canon but offer superior performance, printing with more detail and at a higher rate, which customers prioritize over price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
2.  **Collaboration Record**: [[asmls_partnerships_and_collaborations | The company works closely with both its customers and its suppliers]], coordinating among all parties to deliver products as demanding as airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

This strong track record and constant process improvement keep [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] at the leading edge of the market, helping to maintain Moore's Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

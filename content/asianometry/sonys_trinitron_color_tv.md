The Trinitron color television stands as Sony co-founder Masaru Ibuka's proudest product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It epitomizes Sony's engineering prowess and tenacity, taking nearly eight years to bring to market, but surpassing all competitors upon its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This breakthrough device is the focus of this article, part of a series on the history of color television in collaboration with IEEE Spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Beginnings: Sony's Vision and Leadership

Sony was founded by two pivotal figures:
*   **Masaru Ibuka** – The company's lead engineer, described as naive, playful, and guileless yet tenacious, relentlessly driven, and an incredibly motivating leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Akio Morita** – 13 years younger than Ibuka, Morita was the charismatic business leader and spokesman, pragmatic and focused on getting things done quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Despite his family being Sony's largest shareholder, Morita deeply respected Ibuka and dedicated himself to ensuring Ibuka's team had the necessary funding for their projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Their partnership lasted 40 years with almost no arguments, perfectly suited to achieve their dream of bringing consumer electronics to ordinary people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. They began with professional audio equipment like the G-type, Japan's first commercially available tape recorder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Sony then licensed the transistor from Western Electric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, using it to create popular consumer devices such as the TR-55 and TR-63 pocket radios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Transition to Televisions

Rising competition in transistor radios prompted Sony to explore new product categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The obvious next step for transistorization was the black-and-white television, which was rapidly gaining popularity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. These TVs operated by an electron gun firing at a screen coated with phosphors, causing them to glow and form images through beam deflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. However, the high energy and heat generated within the TV meant that standard Germanium power transistors were insufficient; a stronger component was needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### [[development_of_silicon_transistors_for_tvs | Silicon Transistors]] and the Micro-TV

The solution lay in [[development_of_silicon_transistors_for_tvs | silicon]], due to its higher melting point and ability to handle elevated temperatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. In 1956, after attending a Bell Labs seminar where [[development_of_silicon_transistors_for_tvs | silicon]] was touted as the future, Ibuka predicted, "this will be the age of [[development_of_silicon_transistors_for_tvs | silicon]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Although small [[development_of_silicon_transistors_for_tvs | silicon transistors]] suitable for signal handling already existed, Ibuka tasked a team with developing [[development_of_silicon_transistors_for_tvs | silicon]] power transistors from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

This was a challenging period for semiconductor technology:
*   Pure [[development_of_silicon_transistors_for_tvs | silicon]] was more expensive than gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   Sony had to import 20-millimeter crystals from France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   Without photolithography, patterns were applied using oxide and mesa masking, involving selective application and etching of layers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

The first product featuring [[development_of_silicon_transistors_for_tvs | silicon transistors]], the TV8-301, was released in 1960. It was small, fragile, and did not sell well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The prevailing American market preference was for large-screen TVs, but Sony's [[development_of_silicon_transistors_for_tvs | silicon]] power transistors had a limitation: impurities caused power leakage, worsening with larger chip sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This meant transistorized TVs could not exceed 5 or 8 inches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

Despite strong advice from American marketing consultants that a small-screen TV would fail, Ibuka chose to lean into this perceived weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Morita, working from Sony America's headquarters in New York City, spearheaded the marketing campaign for the "Micro-TV." He hired Volkswagen's advertising agency and motivated Sony's sales team to unprecedented efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. These efforts paid off, and the 5-303W Micro-TV became a commercial success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## [[challenges_in_early_color_tv_technology | Color TV]] Development

As soon as the Micro-TV was complete, Ibuka set his sights on color television, which proved significantly more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### CBS Field Sequential System

In the 1940s, CBS patented a field sequential system for color television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>:
*   It used a mechanical rotation of red, blue, and green filters at 1,400 revolutions per minute in front of the camera, creating sequential color images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   A special color TV would display these images so rapidly that the human brain perceived a full-color image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   While producing a better image than John Logie Baird's 1928 work, it required a high refresh rate to avoid flicker, meaning three times the data of black-and-white broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   To compensate, CBS engineers reduced the frame rate and frame size, making it incompatible with existing black-and-white systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

RCA, with significant investments in the black-and-white ecosystem, risked losing everything if the CBS system was adopted in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

### RCA Shadow Mask Tube

In response to the CBS system, RCA launched a six-month crash program in September 1949, resulting in the Shadow Mask Tube as a credible alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   It used three electron guns (for red, green, and blue) at the back of the TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   These guns fired converging beams towards a "Shadow Mask," a thin metal sheet with tiny holes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   The mask was positioned in front of a screen with red, blue, and green phosphors arranged in pixels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   The guns were precisely aligned so each beam passed through the mask's holes to hit only its corresponding color phosphor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
*   The glowing phosphors created the illusion of full color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   While not exceptionally bright, its crucial advantage was compatibility with existing black-and-white systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### [[comparison_between_chromatron_and_shadow_mask_tube | The Shadow Mask Tube's Weaknesses]]

Color TV adoption was slow, unlike the rapid success of black-and-white TVs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Six years after RCA's first color TV, only one color set was sold for every fifty black-and-white sets in the US; Japan's figures were even worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. While content availability was initially a factor, the Shadow Mask Tubes themselves were largely to blame, even as color content increased with NBC's programming in 1962 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

Key weaknesses included:
*   **Low Brightness** – 85% of electrons hit the mask instead of the screen, leading to poor efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **High Manufacturing Cost** – Three separate electron guns required complex alignment, making each TV set needing manual tuning by a skilled worker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Vulnerability to Magnetic Fields** – External magnetic fields could disrupt the beam alignment, causing annoying colored patches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Difficult Mask Production** – The shadow mask itself was challenging to produce, involving chemical, mechanical, and photographic techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Sony Meets the Chromatron

Despite the Shadow Mask Tube's flaws, RCA licensed its system widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Sony considered licensing it to quickly enter the market, but Ibuka found simply copying the market leader "no fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

In 1961, Ibuka and Morita discovered the Chromatron at an IEEE trade show in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   Invented in 1951 by Nobel laureate Dr. Ernest Lawrence (also known for inventing the cyclotron and portrayed in the movie *Oppenheimer*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   Morita was so impressed by its sharp, bright screen that he immediately secured a technical license from its owner, a Paramount Pictures subsidiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   Sony sent physicist Senri Miyaoka to learn the technology. He found the American development team glum and frustrated, leading him to sense Sony had undertaken a formidable challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

#### Making the Chromatron

The Chromatron aimed to resolve the Shadow Mask Tube's intricate three-gun alignment issue by using a single electron gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   Instead of pixel arrangements, the screen phosphors were arranged in parallel, vertical stripes (green, blue, red) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   The single gun fired sequential color data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   To ensure the correct color information hit the correct phosphor stripe, the Chromatron used a "grill" of up to 400 charged vertical wires just inside the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. These "color-selecting wires" activated to deflect unwanted electrons, directing the right signal to the right stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

#### Troubles with the Chromatron

Sony built a new factory in Tokyo for the Chromatron, but mass production faced severe difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. A major challenge was synchronizing the electron beam with the activation/deactivation of the grill wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. When it worked, it was beautiful, but failures (which were frequent) led to sickening color variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

In September 1964, a 17-inch Chromatron prototype was displayed in Sony showrooms to build hype, but the factory struggled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. With 27 vacuum tubes and delicate wires spaced less than a millimeter apart, it was ten times more complex to produce than a standard shadow mask tube TV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. For every 1,000 sets made, only two or three worked correctly, with grid misalignment causing faces to turn green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

Ibuka, recalling past successes where perseverance paid off (like with transistors for radios), refused to back down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. However, in 1965, the team concluded that Dr. Lawrence's original single-gun Chromatron method was too costly due to the color-switching grill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. They switched to a three-gun method, similar to RCA's, which reintroduced gun alignment issues but eased manufacturing tolerances for the vertical wires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

In May 1965, Sony released a 19-inch Chromatron to the Japanese market, selling 13,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Each set sold for 198,000 yen ($550 USD) but cost 400,000 yen ($1,111 USD) to make, coupled with numerous defects that led to a lifetime warranty being heavily utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Despite these unfavorable economics, Ibuka again refused to abandon the project, doubling down and making the Chromatron Sony's highest priority with 150 people on the team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

By 1966, the Shadow Mask Tube system was mature, and color TVs were mainstream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Sony's distributors urged the company to release a color TV in the US. The Chromatron's losses, combined with $700,000 in annual R&D costs, created tension between Ibuka and Morita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Though they never argued publicly, the strain was palpable, with accountants monitoring engineering sessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Morita even berated the team for exploring "curiosities" rather than solving problems, yet he secretly secured a $2 million loan to fund continued R&D <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

Finally, in 1966, Ibuka agreed to dissolve the Chromatron team and adopt the Shadow Mask Tube if a viable alternative wasn't found by year-end. He personally led the team, feeling responsible for the lost five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. The team split to explore parallel approaches, with Ibuka actively involved in their experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

### Three in a Line

In 1966, General Electric released their "Portacolor" TV, a Shadow Mask Tube with a single electron gun equipped with three cathodes arranged in a straight line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>. Unlike the Chromatron's triangular (delta) arrangement of three guns, the Portacolor's "in-line" configuration intrigued Sony manager Susumu Yoshida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

Yoshida, though unimpressed by Portacolor's brightness (it still used a shadow mask), wondered how its three-cathode, one-gun setup might work with the Chromatron's grill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. He proposed this idea to Senri Miyaoka, who rigged a test by strapping two cathodes to a standard black-and-white electron gun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. This yielded a bright, albeit blurry, picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

Miyaoka documented his findings, and Ibuka summoned him to discuss the report. In a rush for orchestra practice, Miyaoka confidently stated it could work in a commercial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. The following Monday, Ibuka reoriented Sony's 7,000-person company towards this new concept, becoming obsessed and personally involved in its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

## Trinitron: The Game-Changer

The Trinitron gun was completed by February 1967, and the prototype by November 1967, representing a significant engineering feat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.
*   It featured a **single electron gun** with three RGB cathodes arranged in a horizontal line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
*   These three beams converged at the center of a large electron lens (the origin of the name "Trinitron") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.
*   After crossing, they expanded outwards, and deflection plates focused and directed them to the correct phosphor stripes on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   Crucially, the Trinitron replaced the shadow mask with an **aperture grill** of etched vertical metal wires, one for each color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:09">[00:21:09]</a>. This allowed more electrons to pass through, resulting in a much brighter picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. The aperture grill presented its own [[challenges_in_early_color_tv_technology | engineering challenges]], primarily due to heat causing expansion or shrinkage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

Sony announced the Trinitron on April 15, 1968, with Ibuka hosting the press conference and displaying ten prototypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Despite Yoshida's estimate of a year to ramp up production, Ibuka boldly declared Sony would offer ten thousand Trinitrons by October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. When the team protested, Ibuka urged them to draw inspiration from the Manhattan Project and appealed to Yoshida, stating, "I will never do this to you again, so please indulge me this once" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

Yoshida, dubbed "Shogun Yoshida" for his ferocity, led the team to convert the prototypes into a commercial product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. To speed up commercialization, Sony first released a 12-inch screen version, even though dealers preferred 17-inch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. Six grueling months later, the 100+ engineers and scientists rolled the first sets off the Tokyo factory line, marking the culmination of an eight-year, $12 million development odyssey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Trinitron broke RCA's long-standing virtual monopoly on color TVs, proving to be a true game-changer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>. Its superior brightness and simpler production process quickly made it dominant in the small color TV market in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. By March 1969, Sony was selling 10,000 sets monthly, soon increasing to 20,000, and could not keep up with demand, leading to factories opening in San Diego and the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

From 1968 to 1998, Sony sold 180 million Trinitrons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. The Trinitron line was finally discontinued in the 2000s when [[innovation_and_challenges_in_sharps_lcd_business | LCD]] and other semiconductor displays took over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:06">[00:24:06]</a>. Remarkably, the Trinitron system remained largely unchanged for twenty years after its introduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

The Trinitron was one of the last products Ibuka directly oversaw before he transitioned to pursuits like youth education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. He passed away in 1997 at age 89 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

Northeast England, once a formidable heavy industry powerhouse, faced significant economic struggles following the decline of these foundational sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. For a prolonged period, the region grappled with identifying its next major growth industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## [[history_of_northeast_englands_industry | Decline of Heavy Industry]]

The economic challenges prevalent in Northeast England today trace back to specific political and historical circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The area had a long-standing dependence on heavy industry and its rich coal mines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. After World War II, the British government nationalized the coal and steel industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The Ministry of Fuel and Power, aiming to maximize output and employment in these resource-dependent economies, controversially argued against introducing new male-employing manufacturing industries to the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This policy left Northeast England precariously reliant on just two industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

Consequently, when de-industrialization commenced in the 1980s, residents had few alternative employment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Tensions peaked during the miners' strike of 1984-1985, where miners fought not for higher wages, but to prevent mine closures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Following the strike's defeat, thousands of miners lost their jobs as imported coal became significantly cheaper than domestically mined coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

By the 1990s, Northeast England found itself marginalized within the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. As of 2012, Northeast Englanders had the lowest median gross annual earnings in England and the highest proportion of the population claiming income support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. In 1995, the unemployment rate stood at 9.1%, 50% higher than the rest of the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Failed Semiconductor Investment

The economic vulnerability of the region led to widespread excitement when [[Siemens semiconductor investment in North Tyneside | Siemens semiconductor]] pledged over a billion pounds for a semiconductor fab in North Tyneside in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This was hailed as a potential turning point for the struggling region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

Despite significant local and national efforts, including the Queen touring the facility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, the plant operated for only 15 months before Siemens closed it in July 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, less than two years after opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. This closure was primarily due to the immense volatility of the DRAM market, which suffered a major crash in 1998, causing prices to plummet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Siemens' decision to equip the North Tyneside fab with older 16-megabyte memory technology, which was already becoming outdated by 1995, made it particularly vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

An attempt to revive the plant under the semiconductor firm Atmel also failed due to the dot-com crash of 2001 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. By 2007, the buildings were sold off, marking the definitive end of the semiconductor dream in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. The former fab facility is now the Cobalt Business Park, hosting government offices, call centers, and regional offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

This period also saw the closure of other foreign-owned factories, including Electrolux and Pringle, and even the Fujitsu fab that opened in 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. A key challenge identified for the local economy is its lack of native corporate leaders, making it dependent on companies from elsewhere that lack deep attachment to the area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

## Green Shoots: Renewable Energy Potential

Despite a long history of economic setbacks, there are emerging "green shoots" for Northeast England's economy, ironically, once again in the energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. Renewable energy companies have begun investing in the region, and a burgeoning wind industry is taking shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

For example, the Dogger Bank Wind Farm is poised to become one of the largest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. This signifies a potential positive shift for a region that has faced considerable economic hardship for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

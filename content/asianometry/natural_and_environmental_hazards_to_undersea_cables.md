Undersea cables are essential backbones of global communications, but they navigate a perilous environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. These "low-tech cables" are susceptible to a variety of natural, animal, and [[humanrelated_threats_and_protections_for_undersea_cables | human-related hazards]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Chafing and Corrosion
A significant long-term natural hazard is chafing and corrosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

*   **Chafing**
    *   Currents and waves can chafe the cable's exterior by rubbing it against rocks and gravel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   This process removes the cable's outer protective layers, exposing its internal components to the ocean <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Corrosion**
    *   Corrosion is often induced by biological creatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
    *   In shallower waters, barnacles, shells, or sponges can cover and foul the cable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   In deeper waters, kelp and corals can have a similar effect; if the area is conducive to coral growth, the cable might become completely encased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Landslides and Earthquakes
Underwater landslides and seismic activity pose significant threats to undersea cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

*   **Underwater Landslides (Turbidity Currents)**
    *   These are fast-moving, dense currents of water and sediment, rushing at speeds up to 45 miles per hour like an avalanche, and can easily cut anything in their path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
    *   Landslides have been a problem for cables since the 1880s, with cable repairing ships noting broken cables buried in fresh sediment or gravel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
    *   **Grand Banks Earthquake (1929)**: A magnitude 7.2 earthquake off Canada triggered a massive underwater landslide an hour later, moving over 175 cubic kilometers of sand and sediment, which cut eleven cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This event is now considered the textbook example of underwater landslide hazards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
    *   **Taiwan Earthquakes (2006)**: A pair of magnitude 7.0 earthquakes off Taiwan triggered multiple landslides, breaking several cables. This incident disrupted communications not only in Taiwan but also across Southeast Asia due to the island's role as a transit point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
    *   **Delta Areas**: Landslides are particularly problematic in delta regions where freshwater rivers meet the sea. Rivers, especially after typhoons, deposit large amounts of silt, biological material, and dirt, forming "slumps" of loosely consolidated materials that can break cables when they move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Earthquakes**
    *   Earthquakes themselves can damage cables. Seismic movements can cause the seafloor to slide and reposition, breaking any cables traversing the affected area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
    *   The Grand Banks Earthquake, in addition to triggering a landslide, independently cut 12 cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## Animal Hazards
Animals, though less frequent culprits, can also damage undersea cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

*   **Whales**: Whales, when swimming deep on the ocean floor in search of food, can become entangled in cables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. The theory is that a whale's lower jaw might get caught in a loose cable, leading to entanglement and drowning as it struggles to free itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Sharks**: Sharks biting cables was once a famous, though now rare, cause of damage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Biologists are not entirely sure what attracts sharks to the cables, but proper reinforcement helps solve this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

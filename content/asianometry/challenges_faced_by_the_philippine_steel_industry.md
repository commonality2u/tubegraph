The Philippine steel industry, once spearheaded by the [[history_and_decline_of_national_steel_corporation_in_the_philippines | National Steel Corporation (NSC)]], has faced numerous challenges over decades, leading to its significant decline and collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Despite having a head start in building a steel industry compared to almost every other Asian country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, a combination of economic factors, management issues, and [[Impact of foreign competition on Philippine steel companies | foreign competition]] led to its downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Early Structural Issues and Economic Shocks

Initially, the Philippines lacked suitable steel facilities, forcing it to export its own iron ore to Japan and then reimport finished steel products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The establishment of state-owned entities like National Shipyard and Steel Corporation (NASCO) and later Iligan Integrated Steel Mills (ISMI) aimed to address this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

However, early challenges emerged:
*   **Currency Crises** A country's currency crisis affected NASCO's plans to purchase steel-making equipment from abroad, necessitating foreign loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Foreign Loan Conditions** The US Export-Import Bank offered a significant loan but stipulated that the money could only be spent on American steel-making equipment and required NASCO's [[privatization_and_mismanagement_of_national_steel_corporation | privatization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This privatization was reportedly insisted upon due to "prior bureaucratic inefficiencies" or pressure from American steel companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Underinvestment and Mismanagement (ISMI)** The privatization process was delayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, and the initial loan proved insufficient to build a fully integrated steel mill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. ISMI struggled to turn a profit, with one view suggesting its owners, the Jacintos, treated it as an "ATM" to cross-subsidize other ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Lack of Government Protection** Unlike Japan, which provided extensive subsidies, raw goods, import bans, and tax incentives to its steel companies, the Philippine government failed to sufficiently protect ISMI, which faced domestic competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Global Oil Price Shocks and Peso Devaluation** The 1970s brought economic turmoil, with the peso devaluing significantly, making imported goods and servicing foreign currency-denominated debts extremely difficult for industrialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Challenges Faced by NSC (National Steel Corporation)

Even after the government re-nationalized ISMI's assets to form the new [[history_and_decline_of_national_steel_corporation_in_the_philippines | National Steel Corporation (NSC)]] in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, new challenges emerged:
*   **[[Impact of foreign competition on Philippine steel companies | Foreign Competition]]** In the 1980s, trade reforms lowered steel product tariffs to three percent, allowing cheap imports from Taiwan and South Korea to flood the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Market Decline and Need for Upgrades** By the 1990s, the market for NSC's core flat steel products was declining due to these cheaper imports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. NSC needed to invest more to stay competitive, including building iron and steel-making capabilities to become truly vertically integrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Lack of Government Funds** The government, with too much exposure to other state-owned corporations, had no funds to spare for NSC's necessary upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This led President Fidel Ramos to advocate for NSC's [[privatization_and_mismanagement_of_national_steel_corporation | privatization]] once again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## Impact of Privatization and Incompetent Management

The [[privatization_and_mismanagement_of_national_steel_corporation | privatization of NSC]] in 1995 to Malaysian company Wintek Holdings marked a turning point towards its decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>:
*   **Incompetent Management** Wintek Holdings were foreign steel traders, not steel makers, and their top management lacked understanding of steel manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The CEO did not even move to the Philippines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Erosion of Trust and Questionable Practices** They stopped holding planning meetings, eroding employee trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. They also switched suppliers to their own trading corporations and clamped down on financial disclosures, creating "windows for fraud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   **Massive Losses** NSC incurred unprecedented losses, including 2 billion pesos in 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Asian Financial Crisis (1997)** The crisis severely impacted NSC after it was sold to another highly leveraged Malaysian firm, Hautic Investment Limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The crisis caused another massive peso devaluation, making NSC's US dollar-denominated loans and raw materials extremely expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Breakdown of Operations** Creditors and suppliers ended relationships, planned upgrades never happened, and existing infrastructure suffered from lack of maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

## Lingering Challenges After Closure

The [[economic_and_social_impact_of_national_steel_corporations_closure | closure of NSC]] in November 1999 led to significant economic and social impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. An attempted revival by Global Steel Philippines Inc. (GSPI), connected to ArcelorMittal, also failed despite having experienced steel makers at the helm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>:
*   **Chronic Lack of Funds** GSPI suffered from a persistent lack of funds, failing to get additional government support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **Adversarial Relationship** An "adversarial relationship" with the local community and government contributed to its closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

While [[Impact of foreign competition on Philippine steel companies | cheap imports]] contributed to the decline of NSC's core markets, the ultimate downfall was largely attributed to the company falling into the hands of an incompetent management team before being hit by an unprecedented financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Proposals for revival occasionally surface but have not materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

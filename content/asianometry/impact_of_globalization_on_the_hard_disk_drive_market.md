## Early International Entrants
While the United States initially dominated the [[History of hard disk drives|hard disk drive]] (HDD) industry, competition soon emerged from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. Japanese and European companies began to enter the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. The four major Japanese computer manufacturers—Fujitsu, Hitachi, NEC, and Toshiba—initially produced HDDs solely for internal consumption but later shifted to an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## American Firms' Globalization Strategy
Despite some innovations, Japanese firms initially struggled to make significant headway in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This was largely because American HDD manufacturers aggressively globalized their manufacturing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

In 1984, Seagate began outsourcing the assembly of its HDDs to Singapore, a move soon followed by several other American HDD makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. This strategic shift was facilitated by the Singapore Government's Economic Development Board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. By 1990, Singapore had become the world's largest producer of HDDs, accounting for 55% of global shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

As labor costs in Singapore increased, lower-value tasks, such as assembling the actuator arm holding the read/write head, were relocated to other Southeast Asian countries like Malaysia or Thailand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Singapore, in turn, took on higher-value tasks, including fabricating platters and assembling more specialized HDD systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

## Japanese Response and Market Shifts
The Japanese HDD manufacturers eventually "caught up" by also outsourcing their production abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. In the early 2000s, they even captured a majority share of the HDD market when Hitachi merged with IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. However, this advantage was later eroded by renewed competition and further mergers within the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

## Outcomes of Globalization

### Benefits for Consumers
The intense competition and globalization within the HDD industry led to significant benefits for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

*   **Increased Data Density**: From 1976 to 1987, the HDD's data density grew twentyfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
*   **Reduced Cost per Megabyte**:
    *   In 1977, a megabyte of data storage cost $560 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
    *   By 1986, this cost dropped to $11.89 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.
    *   By 1990, it further decreased to $6.86 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>.
    *   By 1998, the cost was a mere 4.3 cents per megabyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

### Impact on US Jobs
The aggressive globalization strategy by American firms allowed them to retain significant market share despite competition from Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. By the mid-1990s, there were no more HDD assembly factories in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. However, higher-paying American jobs in R&D, head manufacturing, and gimbals were largely preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>.

Despite these outcomes, the rapid commoditization and [[Competitive dynamics and market saturation in the hard disk drive industry|fierce competition]] in the industry ultimately led to a significant shakeout of firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. The number of HDD firms peaked at 66 in 1990 but was cut in half to 33 by 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. By 1998, only 16 firms remained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. Even the HDD's inventor, IBM, exited the market by merging its HDD operations with Hitachi's in 2002 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.

Today, three major HDD makers remain: Seagate, Western Digital, and Toshiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. The growth and [[Innovations and challenges in hard disk drive technology|innovation]] in HDDs have largely diminished as new technologies like Solid State Drives (SSDs) gain prominence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.

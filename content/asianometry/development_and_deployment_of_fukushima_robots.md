In March 2011, the Great East Japan Earthquake triggered a massive tsunami that incapacitated the cooling systems of the [[Fukushima disaster and nuclear meltdown | Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This led to [[Nuclear fuel removal and cleanup at Fukushima | nuclear fuel meltdown]] and subsequent hydrogen explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. To minimize human safety risks during the site's decommissioning, the plant's owner, TEPCO, and the Japanese government deployed a series of advanced, [[Impact of radiation on robotics technology | radiation-hardened robots]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant Units
The Fukushima Daiichi plant consists of six units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   Units 4, 5, and 6 were not operational during the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
    *   Units 5 and 6 suffered minor tsunami damage but remained essentially functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   Unit 4 was damaged by the tsunami and experienced a hydrogen explosion from exhaust spillover from Unit 3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. However, its fuel rods sustained little damage as the reactor was shut down, resulting in tolerable radiation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   Units 1, 2, and 3 were operational when the tsunami struck and suffered the worst damage, including meltdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Units 1 and 3 also experienced hydrogen explosions, releasing radioactive materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Precedent: Robotics in Nuclear Disasters

### Three Mile Island (1979)
The first nuclear response robots were developed by the United States after the 1979 Three Mile Island accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Surveillance and In-service Inspection Robot (first deployed Aug 1982)**: A crawler that took photographs, collected samples, and made radiation readings in high radiation areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Fred (introduced a year later)**: Equipped with a high-pressure water spray for decontamination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Three Remote Reconnaissance Vehicles**: Built and deployed to de-fuel the reactor core, which was flooded with radioactive water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. These robots were practical, tethered, used familiar technologies, and were kept small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Chernobyl (1986)
After Chernobyl, the Soviet Union initially used hundreds of thousands of human "biorobots" to clean up rubble and debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This was due to extremely high radiation levels that caused available robots to fail, and bureaucratic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Specialized Transport Robot (STR-1)**: A wirelessly controlled bulldozer adapted from an unmanned lunar vehicle, eventually brought in for debris removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Initial Robot Deployment at Fukushima

The first robots arrived at Fukushima in April 2011, three weeks after the accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### American Robotics Contributions
Four military multipurpose robots from the **iRobot Corporation USA** were deployed into the damaged and irradiated Unit 1, 2, and 3 reactor buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Pakbot**: First used in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2000 for detecting and diffusing improvised explosive devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. It is small (around 30 kg), lightweight, and has a tread design with extension arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Pakbots measured radiation dosage, atmospheric temperatures, and oxygen concentrations inside Unit 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Its limitations included restricted radio communication range and difficulty with stairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Warrior**: A larger iRobot model brought in for additional cleaning work throughout the second half of 2011, vacuuming and clearing obstacles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **T-Hawk**: A small unmanned aerial vehicle from Honeywell, it flew over Units 1 through 4 from April to July 2011 to survey the situation and collect dust samples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
Other international robots included Bobcat and the Swedish-built Brokk 90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This reliance on American robots sparked a mild controversy regarding Japan's own robotics capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Japanese Robotics Response
Following a 1999 criticality accident, three Japanese technology centers, including what is now the **Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA)**, developed nuclear disaster robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Remote Surveillance Squad (Rescue Robots)**: Three robots built by JAEA for measurements and sample collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. However, due to a lack of budget, they received few upgrades after their 2001 completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. By the time of the Fukushima disaster, many critical components were out of stock, and there were no trained operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **JAEA-3**: JAEA re-engineered the Rescue robot by grafting parts from a Brokk unit, which finally started missions in September 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Kinsei Series (Chiba Institute of Technology)**: TEPCO sought these search and rescue robots from the Neito Project at Chiba Institute of Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The Kinsei (Spanish for 15) robots had continuous tracks, were waterproof, and highly mobile across difficult terrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. TEPCO requested modifications, most significantly to harden them against radioactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Kinsei entered reactor buildings in June 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Kinsei 2 and 3 were redesigned and deployed in February 2012 after a communication link failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## [[Impact of radiation on robotics technology | Radiation Hardening]] of Robots
A nuclear accident releases various types of radiation, including alpha particles, beta particles, gamma rays, x-rays, and neutron particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. When these interact with semiconductor materials, two main effects occur:
1.  **Displacement Effect**: Particles like neutrons and alpha particles collide with semiconductors, displacing atoms and altering their structural arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This leads to increased current leakage and decreased device lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
2.  **Ionization Effect**: Electrons, protons, and x-rays passing through semiconductors create electron-hole pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This can cause permanent glitches and erratic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Damage occurs at device, circuit, and system levels, requiring radiation hardening at all these levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Device Level**: Modifying transistor layouts, adding insulating substrates (like silicon-on-insulator), or making devices larger (e.g., bigger gate sizes for higher current capacities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Circuit Level**: Duplicating critical circuits or adding monitoring circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **System Level**: Adding radiation armor, redundancies, and preventive scrubbing algorithms to correct errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Gamma ray testing on Kinsei's conventional electronics (including its 180 nanometer CPU, motherboard, and motor driver boards) found that its essential components could survive a dose of about 200 grays (20,000 rads) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This meant Kinsei could operate for over 100 hours with only a 10% chance of failure, given initial measurements of about 100 grays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

## Ongoing Decommissioning Efforts
After the immediate emergency, the Japanese government's goals shifted to gradually decommissioning the plant and rebuilding the surrounding area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This process is overseen by TEPCO and the International Research Institute for Nuclear Decommissioning (IRID) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Site Cleanup
The hydrogen explosions scattered rubble across the site, necessitating its removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Astaco Sora (Hitachi)**: A heavy-duty robot designed to collect rubble into recycling bins using its two heavy-duty arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Raccoon and Arounder**: Smaller cleaner bots that spray down the ground around Unit 2 or other areas with high-pressure water jets or dry ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Meister**: A heavy-duty robot capable of drilling for samples or vacuuming up particles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

### [[Nuclear fuel removal and cleanup at Fukushima | Spent Fuel Rod Removal]]
Each unit has a spent fuel assembly for storing fuel no longer useful for energy generation, which must be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[0:10:53]</a>.
*   **Unit 4**: TEPCO successfully removed 1,535 spent fuel rods from the damaged Unit 4 reactor pool by December 2014, moving them to a cooling pool in Unit 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Unit 3**: TEPCO began removing 566 spent fuel rods from Unit 3 in 2019, completing the task by February 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   **Units 1 & 2**: Removal of spent fuel rods for Units 1 and 2 is scheduled to begin in 2023 or later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### Nuclear Fuel Debris (Corium) Removal
In Units 1, 2, and 3, the nuclear fuel melted down, burning through the reactor pressure vessel and its concrete pedestal, eventually reaching the primary containment vessel (PCV) before being cooled and solidifying into "corium" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This corium must be inspected and removed. IRID used different robots to investigate each reactor's unique circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

*   **Unit 1**:
    *   The PCV is flooded to a depth of 2 meters with corium likely at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
    *   In 2012, TEPCO used a wired camera and water tests through a small hole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
    *   **P-Morph (IRID, 2014)**: A morphing robot designed to squeeze through a 100 mm hole and then transform into a U-shape to bypass a lead radiation shield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. The first P-Morph encountered an obstacle, but improvements led to mission completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The next step is a robot to collect the pebble-like nuclear fuel debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

*   **Unit 2**:
    *   The building structure remains intact due to no hydrogen explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
    *   **Scorpion (TEPCO)**: A robot that could crawl through a small hole and reconfigure itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Deployed in 2017, its left tread failed, and it was left inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
    *   The team ultimately photographed the reactor's interior using a camera suspended from a "fishing rod" to create a panorama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

*   **Unit 3**:
    *   The PCV is almost entirely flooded to a depth of about 6 meters, requiring new approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
    *   The Unit 2 entrance approach was not feasible due to flooding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
    *   **Mini Manbo (Little Sunfish)**: A tiny robot (13 cm across, 30 cm long) built over two years to navigate the flooded environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. In 2017, the Mini Manbo successfully recorded video of the nuclear debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

*   **Future Plans**:
    *   IRID and TEPCO plan to start collecting and removing nuclear fuel debris from Unit 2 first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
    *   A massive stainless steel robotic arm will be built outside the PCV to reach in and pick up debris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. This project's start is delayed to 2023 due to the need for capability improvements and additional attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
    *   IRID estimates it will take at least 10 years to remove all nuclear fuel debris from Fukushima <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, with further cleaning and decontamination work needed for years beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

Despite the challenges, improvements have allowed the government to permit local residents to return to their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. The evacuation order for Kuma, the town closest to the plant, was lifted in April 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. However, only a small percentage of residents have returned, indicating that significant work remains for both people and robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.

## The Initial Gap and Early Soviet Ambitions

In 1986, the Soviet Union possessed just over 10,000 computers, a stark contrast to the 1.3 million held by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While the Soviet Union was the world's third most proficient computing power at the time of Stalin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, by the 1960s, the computing gap with the U.S. was already several years long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. By the 1980s, this gap was undeniable and essentially permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

The Soviet state supported science and industrial modernization, with abundant funding for research and development in hard sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. They had top minds, launched Sputnik <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, and landed on Venus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. However, this success did not translate to their computing industry.

### Early Efforts and Challenges

News of the ENIAC, the first general-purpose programmable computer built in the U.S. in 1946, reached the Soviet Union in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. While many dismissed it as propaganda due to limited information about its vacuum tube technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, the Soviets noted the significant Western investment in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

The Soviet government urgently needed to improve calculating workflows, especially for the [[comparisons_between_soviet_and_american_nuclear_weapons_development | nuclear weapons effort]], which required over 100 "calculator girls" working daily eight-hour shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Administrators were concerned about finding enough people to perform error-free calculations for complex tasks like differential equations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

In 1948, the Institute of Precision Mechanics and Computer Technology (ITMVT) was established within the Soviet Academy of Sciences to explore computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. However, the ITMVT's initial efforts focused on mechanical analog calculating machines due to the political influence of its director, Nikolai Brevich, who doubted the feasibility of reliable electronic general computers in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Opposing this direction during the Stalin era was dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Breakthrough in Ukraine and the BESEM-1

Meanwhile, in Ukraine, Sergey Lebedev, director of the Kiev Electrotechnical Institute, learned of American digital computer efforts in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Lebedev, a war hero who developed a tank gun stabilization system during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, realized the importance of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Over two years, he built his "little calculating machine," the Mali Electrono Machina (MESM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Despite its name, MESM had about 6,000 vacuum tubes and occupied 60 square meters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

In December 1951, MESM solved its first real calculation for an artillery weapons table, requiring 250,000 calculations and two and a half hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Its demonstration to political leaders, including future Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in late 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, impressed him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This led to Khrushchev's approval to depose Nikolai Brevich and allow ITMVT to develop a new, more powerful digital computer called the Bolshaya Electronia (BESEM-1) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

BESEM-1, meaning "large calculating machine," was capable of 8,000 to 10,000 operations per second (8-10 kiloflops) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This would have made it one of the world's fastest computers, certainly the fastest in Europe, especially compared to America's leading UNIVAC 1, which only achieved about 1 kiloflop in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Internal Competition and Production Struggles

However, ITMVT struggled to deliver BESEM-1 due to internal competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The Ministry of Machine and Instrument Engineering had established SKB245 to make mechanical analog computers, but SKB245 soon proposed building their own digital high-speed computer, the Strela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

The Strela was computationally inferior to the BESEM-1, performing only two kiloflops compared to BESEM's 8-10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Despite this, its supporters argued that Strela's speed was sufficient, as it could perform in 10 hours what a single mathematician would take 100,000 days to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. With Stalin's blessing, the two institutes competed, harming BESEM's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

Near completion, ITMVT needed cathode ray tubes for memory storage, but the sole ministry producing them was SKB245's own Ministry of Machine and Instrument Engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. They refused to supply the tubes for BESEM-1, forcing the team to use inferior mercury storage tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. A 1951 state commission chose Strela over BESEM-1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

However, users quickly discovered Strela's flaws: frequent breakdowns and inability to solve complex quadratic equations essential for [[comparisons_between_soviet_and_american_nuclear_weapons_development | fission development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. By 1955, the head of the Soviet nuclear development effort requested BESEM replacements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. BESEM-1 remained Europe's fastest computer for a few more years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, but this episode foreshadowed future [[challenges_in_soviet_computer_production | Soviet issues in building a competitive computer industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## The Production Chasm

While the Soviets successfully developed a first-generation computer as fast as the West and arguably better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, the story at the production level was vastly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

In 1959, the Soviet Union produced computers worth $59 million, but the United States produced $1 billion in computer hardware that same year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. By 1964, the Soviet Union produced 200 million [[history_of_soviet_semiconductor_technology | semiconductor]] pieces, a significant improvement but still far behind the 1.36 billion produced by the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### Reasons for Failure

The [[soviet_computer_development_history | Soviet computing industry]] failed primarily because it could not produce enough good computers fast enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Within the Soviet command economy, computers failed to reach their full potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. While the military had some demand, it was limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

In the West, computer-aided automation revolutionized industrial processes like steel making and manufacturing, driving titanic commercial and industrial demand for computers far exceeding military demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. However, Soviet steel makers, for example, only needed to meet quotas, which said nothing about the quality or efficiency of production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Consequently, Soviet computer makers had little incentive to produce productivity-improving computers or provide the necessary training and customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This reluctance led ministers to be hesitant in allocating resources to computer development, resulting in factories frequently lacking funding, materials, and skilled personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. For instance, in 1958, the Penza computer and analytical machine plant, one of only two in the Soviet Union, requested 50 computer experts but received only seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

This was a systemic problem for the Soviet Union, which had a long history of lagging behind peers in distributing new revolutionary technologies across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Despite pioneering in steel-making and synthetic fibers and even selling patents to 30 countries including Japan, the Soviets consistently lagged in pushing these innovations within their own economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## Second and Third Generation Computing

In 1959, the West began transitioning from vacuum tubes to transistors, ushering in second-generation computer technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The transistor's reliability and smaller size transformed the computer from a scientific curiosity into a powerful industrial tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The IBM 1401, dubbed the "Model T of computers," sold over 12,000 units, driving the development of new peripherals and programming paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

The Soviets also worked on their second-generation computers, notably the Ural series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. The true flagship was the BESEM-6, the Soviet Union's first supercomputer, capable of over a million operations per second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. It entered production in 1967 and saw widespread adoption, leading to new software and multi-program operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. While this showed great progress, the Americans were already moving to third-generation computers powered by integrated circuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The Soviets managed to deliver first and second-generation computers about two years behind the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

### The IBM 360 and the Soviet Decision to Copy

The emergence of the "computing gap" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union began with third-generation computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. In 1964, IBM announced the System/360, a complete line of computer hardware with backward and forward compatibility, which revolutionized the industry and became one of IBM's greatest commercial successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

In the Soviet Union, it became clear that demand for future computers was immense, and the disjointed domestic industry needed to consolidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Public criticism mounted; *Izvestia* levied the first major critique in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, and *Pravda* questioned the industry's readiness in 1966, stating:

> "Unfortunately we must state that the situation is far from optimistic." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>

In 1967, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union issued Resolution 1184-20 to consolidate its computing industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The goal was to produce a series of unified third-generation computers, the ES (Unified System) project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. The resolution boosted the computing manufacturing budget tenfold to 3 billion rubles by 1975, aiming to build 28 new plants, expand 22 existing ones, and produce 20,000 computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

To build the ES, ministries opted to copy an American IBM 360 model's design for software compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This was controversial, with some arguing it would make the USSR an "intellectual colony of the West" and hinder domestic innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. A memo read:

> "Copying foreign work excludes the possibility of utilizing our own collective experience of computer research and in the immediate future will hinder our ability to employ new principles this will bring the development of computer technology in our nation to an end." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>

The U.S. government forbade IBM from exporting 360 systems to the Soviet Union, meaning the Soviets had to acquire genuine systems and documentation through espionage or intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

An alternative was working with ICL, the UK's largest computer maker, which offered to share technology and documentation from its 360-compatible System 4 line in 1968 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. This promising option would have provided 360 software compatibility, British programming methods, and industrial sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. However, it would delay the project by at least one and a half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Given the wide U.S.-Soviet computer gap and high political priority from Brezhnev, such a delay was politically unpalatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. Furthermore, the [[east_germanys_struggle_to_keep_up_with_western_semiconductor_advancements | East German government]] had already begun copying the IBM 360, making a change of direction politically difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

## Consequences of the [[strategic_decisions_in_soviet_computing_industry | Strategic Decisions]]

The decision to copy had tragic, long-lasting consequences for the [[soviet_computer_development_history | Soviet computing industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Several prominent computer scientists resigned in protest, and Sergey Lebedev's attempts to reverse the decision reportedly hastened his death in 1974 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

Over 100 organizations, 46,000 scientists, and 300,000 workers across the Eastern Bloc contributed to the ES project, producing over 15,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Much of the ES hardware was created through reverse engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Peripherals, especially disk storage solutions, fell short of Western alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. While the ES's 360 compatibility did accelerate Soviet software capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, contemporary CIA estimates in the 1970s believed the [[comparison_between_soviet_networking_ambitions_and_western_advancements_like_arpanet | Soviet computing gap]] shrank from 10-15 years to about 4-6 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

However, this short-term gain led to a long-term loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. Starting in the 1980s, the Soviet industry struggled to reverse-engineer increasingly complex Western computers, widening the gap once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. The Soviets had lost the native industrial capacity to develop anything new on their own, making the gap permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. Industrial productivity struggled as 1970s computers aged and frequently broke down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. By 1989, a quarter of all Soviet general-purpose computers were ES-1022s, made in 1974 but copying 1965 technology, meaning they were 24 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

Linkage to foreign technology also caused issues when the U.S. and West levied export bans on advanced technologies during international crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. While some U.S. policymakers argued that allowing technology access helped the Soviets close the gap, the gap persisted, and the Soviets were never able to fully close it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

The [[soviet_industrial_growth_and_technological_lag | fall of the Soviet computing industry]] was a story of wasted talents, lost progress, foolish short-term strategic choices made by politicians over scientists, and the limits of centralized planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

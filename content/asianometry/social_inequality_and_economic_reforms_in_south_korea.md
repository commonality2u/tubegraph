From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

South Korea's economy is profoundly shaped by powerful business groups known as [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]], such as Samsung, Hyundai, and LG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While these groups are a major economic strength, powering the country's export economy and dominating daily life, they are also a significant economic weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] have been accused of manipulating the Korean economy to their advantage and maintaining corrupt ties with high levels of power through substantial payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This dynamic has contributed to significant social and economic inequality.

## Historical Context of Corruption and Chaebol Formation

The roots of [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | corruption in Korea]] predate the modern state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### Japanese Colonial Era
The Japanese colonial state, with its agricultural economy, was characterized by corruption and inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Large landlords earned all the income and ruthlessly exploited farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Although this administration ended with World War II, many of its legacies transferred to the new South Korean government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Syngman Rhee and Early Privatization
South Korea's first president, Syngman Rhee, was a staunch anti-communist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. His actions included massacres against suspected communists, leading to approximately 100,000 deaths, such as the Bodo League massacre in 1950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Rhee also played a role in creating the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] by needing to raise funds for the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. From 1946 through the 1950s, his government sold off assets seized from the old Japanese state and other prized state-owned entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The prices for these privatizations were determined by private negotiation rather than public auction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Valuable companies like Tongyang Beers (today Oriental Breweries), Daehan Textile, and Tongyang Cement became part of the Tongyang Group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Similar to Japan's zaibatsu, the purchasers of these assets eventually became the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Park Chung-hee and Crony Capitalism
In 1961, Park Chung-hee led a military coup, ending the Second Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Initially, Park arrested [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] heads for corrupt wealth accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. However, his government quickly negotiated a [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | crony capitalism]] deal with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Park sought to emulate Japan's industrialization and needed the companies' assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] agreed to support Park's policies for import substitution and later exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. In return, the government provided foreign currency loans at below-market interest rates for the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] to acquire foreign technologies and build capacity in industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Additionally, the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] contributed funds to Park's presidential election campaigns, often as 10-15% loan commissions or kickbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This led companies to realize that the best way to acquire cheap capital and get rich was by being close with the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. For example, Park Chung-hee maintained close personal ties with Chung Ju-yung of Hyundai and Kim Woo-jong of Daewoo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Kickbacks increased over time; in 1990 prices, the top five [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] contributed over 800 million won annually to the Park government before 1972, growing to 1.5 billion won after 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

For the next 20 years, the government and the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] jointly ran Korean society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Companies funded political campaigns and satisfied the social compact of growing the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The government granted privileges to the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] and imposed the costs of their excesses onto society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. For instance, in 1971, when [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] were over-leveraged, the government converted their private market loans to five-year public ones and froze private interest rates, harming small lenders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Chaebol Dominance and Growing Imbalance

As Korea entered the turbulent 1980s, the military dictatorship's monopoly on power weakened, and the partnership between government and [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] became shakier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Economic Power and Political Influence
By the mid-1980s, the balance of power had shifted decisively in the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]]'s favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The top five [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] accounted for nearly 20% of the country's GDP and 45% of its mining/manufacturing output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The top ten [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] owned an average of 8.6 manufacturing businesses, with 20 to 40 businesses in total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Impact on Small and Medium Businesses
Korea's [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]]-centric strategy stifled the country's small and medium-sized business sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. From 1966 to 1976, the number of manufacturing firms in Korea grew only 10%, but their size exploded by 176% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. In contrast, Taiwan, which pursued a less cozy state-business relationship and was not hit by a devastating war, saw its number of manufacturing firms grow by 150% and firm size by 29% over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Public Discontent
The vast imbalance between the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] and the rest of the country became a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. As people grew wealthier, they demanded more than just higher wages; they sought better environmental regulations, working conditions, and a better life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The increasingly democratic government had to respond by shifting from a stance of support to one of regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Post-Democratization Challenges and Financial Crisis

Despite the shift, government leaders still relied on the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]]'s financial contributions to remain in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. During Chun Doo-hwan's administration, [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] contributed 15 to 22 billion won to high-level political campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, and 21 to 25 billion won during Roh Tae-woo's subsequent administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This corrupt relationship persisted partly due to the weakness of Korea's political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. During the military dictatorship, parties served as shells for candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. When the country democratized in 1987 with free elections, there was no time to build suitable political campaigning norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Without an above-board financing system, parties and candidates lacked cash, making them vulnerable to corruption, which allowed the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] to continue receiving government aid, plentiful capital, favorable regulations, and protection from competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Asian Financial Crisis and Chaebol Power
The [[impact_of_financial_crisess_on_south_korean_business_practices | Asian financial crisis]] demonstrated the consequences of Korea's inability to control its large businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. In the decade following democratization in 1987, the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] gained substantial political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. For example, in 1988, Daewoo Group influenced the National Assembly to amend the law to allow a government bailout of the ailing Daewoo Shipbuilding Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. They also used their power to push for rapid liberalization reforms that aided their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### Structural Issues: Foreign Capital and Cross-Ownership
One reform allowed the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] easier access to foreign capital financing, leading them to take out cheap loans denominated in foreign currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This ignited a massive debt boom that culminated in the [[impact_of_financial_crisess_on_south_korean_business_practices | Asian financial crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Another major reform allowed the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] to take limited ownership stakes in non-bank financial companies, which encouraged complex cross-ownership structures that obscured their true size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. For instance, the Samsung Group's controlling Lee family owned a minority of shares in Samsung-affiliated firms but exercised operating control over almost all of them through this small slice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. These increasingly complex structures meant it was unclear which subsidiaries were profitable and which were losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Profitable companies began propping up weaker ones, leading to market inefficiencies and oversupply in certain industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Reforms and Their Consequences (Post-1997)

The crisis of 1997 significantly curbed the power of the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]], opening the door for reforms aimed at "common prosperity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Goals and Measures
The Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun administrations imposed various reforms on the ailing [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. The goals were to prevent future financial crises by limiting debt capacity and cross-shareholder structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Some reforms succeeded, with wide-ranging consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. For example, Hanjin Shipping was required to reduce its debt-to-equity ratio below 200%, forcing it to sell ships and lease others to maintain capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

### Impact on Industries and Employment
Reforms cut "fat" in industries; for instance, the Korean car industry, which had five independent companies in 1997, soon had only one: Hyundai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | Chaebol]] reduced their affiliates and further separated them; a sample showed 819 affiliates in 1997, decreasing to 544 three years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Dividends to minority shareholders increased from 2.2 trillion won in 2001 to 10.8 trillion by 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### The Export Juggernaut and Social Disparity
The crisis also spurred the creation of Korea's export juggernaut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Realizing an unfriendly domestic environment, the largest [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] leveraged free trade agreements in the 2000s and turned outwards, becoming highly successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. By 2013, 86% of Samsung's revenue came from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This success drove the Korean economy's top-line recovery, growing at an average rate of 5% from 1998 to 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

However, this economic growth hid troubling social issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. The benefits of growth primarily fell to a small cohort of people, creating a significant gap between the "haves" and "have-nots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. In 2013, [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] generated over 50% of revenue and value-add in the manufacturing sector but employed less than 20% of the sector's employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. During the post-1997 reform era, the government sought to make [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] more profitable to service debts, and in exchange, allowed them to more easily lay off people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Hundreds of thousands lost their jobs, with many failing to find regular salaried work since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Elder poverty in Korea reached four times the OECD average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, and the income share for the top 1% of Korean society rose from 7% before 1997 to 12% in the mid-2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The Korean people recognized this inequality and their lack of shared success from the country's "national champions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## Political Responses and Continued Inequality

This widespread discontent led the Korean people to vote for a change of direction in 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### Lee Myung-bak Administration
President Lee Myung-bak, a conservative from the Park Chung-hee lineage and former CEO of Hyundai Construction, emphasized economic recovery after what he called a "lost decade of liberal rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. His 2007 campaign promised to raise GDP growth to 7%, achieve a per capita income of $40,000, and make Korea the seventh-largest economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Lee won with the highest margin in years, but low voter participation indicated a loss of faith in the government's ability to curb social inequalities and bring back prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:13:03]</a>.

Lee's business policies reflected a belief that the previous decade had hindered [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]]'s ability to compete globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. He lowered the corporate tax rate from 25% to 20%, raised the ceiling on non-bank financial investment, and amnestied executives convicted after the financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. He also oversaw a continuation of market-oriented reforms, giving more decision-making power to industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. While aiming to bring back rapid economic growth reminiscent of Park Chung-hee's era, Lee did not force the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] to funnel profits into new and risky industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Instead, money was funneled to "rust-belt" industries like construction and infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The Lee administration failed to deliver the promised growth, with GDP growth continuing to decline throughout the 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Lee was arrested in 2018 on charges of bribery, embezzlement, and tax fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### Park Geun-hye and Moon Jae-in Administrations
In the 2012 presidential election, conservative Park Geun-hye campaigned with a blend of nostalgia for past "glory years" and a stronger emphasis on welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. However, she did not advocate for a higher capital gains tax, a key factor in the accelerating Korean wealth gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

Modern corruption by the [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] aims to maximize their wealth and market power, particularly through tax manipulations and legislation/regulatory capture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

### Consequences of Regulatory Capture: The Sewol Sinking
The consequences of this [[history_of_corruption_and_crony_capitalism_in_south_korea | corruption]] and lack of regulation became tragically apparent with the 2014 Sewol ferry sinking, which claimed 304 lives, mostly high school students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. While the ferry was old and overloaded, the most proximate reason for the high death rate was that safety and rescue regulations were ignored for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. The regulatory agency and the ferry company worked closely to ignore violations and maintain the profitable status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. This status quo included the rotation of government employees into the industry and the ferry company's monopoly privilege on the lucrative Incheon-Jeju ferry route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

South Korea's struggle with its largest companies persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. President Park Geun-hye's administration ended in corruption scandals and impeachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Her successor, President Moon Jae-in, implemented business reforms and higher tax rates, which seemed to improve public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

## Ongoing Debate
The South Korean economy, like Taiwan's, is now highly dependent on a handful of powerful global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Substantial reform is likely to weaken their global competitive position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. South Korean democratic society has become increasingly polarized, and [[chaebol_dominance_in_south_koreas_economy | chaebol]] reform continues to be a furiously debated issue in presidential politics, alongside concerns about North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

Sri Lanka's ongoing economic crisis is the culmination of various factors, including several fateful policy choices such as import substitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. These policies, intended to foster domestic industry and conserve foreign currency, ultimately contributed to the country's economic stagnation and reduced its resilience to external shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42:00">[18:42:00]</a>.

## Early Import Substitution (1950s-1970s)

After gaining independence in 1948, Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) had a strong starting position with a strategic port location, no World War II infrastructure damage, high rankings in education and health, and a democratic government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Its highly productive export economy specialized in tea, rubber, and coconuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. In 1950, its GNP, adjusted for purchasing power parity, was higher than that of India, Pakistan, Thailand, and even [[south_koreas_economic_strategies_for_shipping_industry | South Korea]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

However, a changing political landscape and economic pressures led to a shift in policy. Following the end of the Korean War in 1953, commodity export revenues crashed, forcing the government to raise prices on rice and other public services, leading to widespread protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. A new government came to power in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

### Implementation and Rationale
The new government imposed import restrictions on consumer goods to conserve limited foreign currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. The state then established monopolies to fulfill these import demands domestically, a policy known as import substitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

### Comparison with East Asian Economies
While such policies can be effective when implemented strategically, as seen in the 1970s when Taiwan and [[south_koreas_economic_strategies_for_shipping_industry | South Korea]] used them for heavy and specialty chemical industries to aid industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>, they must be part of a larger economic strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>. Earlier attempts by Taiwan and [[south_koreas_economic_strategies_for_shipping_industry | South Korea]] in the 1950s, targeting textiles and fertilizers to conserve foreign exchange and protect domestic industry, failed to achieve targeted growth rates and led to corruption due to close government-business relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

### Negative Consequences
In Sri Lanka, wide-ranging import substitution policies resulted in significant inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. The government's attempts to do everything themselves led to higher costs for domestic products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. Import demand simply shifted from finished goods to imported raw materials, making the economy vulnerable to price shocks in raw goods, such as the oil crises of the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

By the 1970s, Sri Lanka had transformed from a relatively open, market-based economy into one of the most closed non-communist economies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. Economic growth dramatically slowed, and the country's development fell behind its peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. By 1977, Sri Lanka's per capita income was only $200, a mere $60 increase from 1960 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. In contrast, [[south_koreas_economic_strategies_for_shipping_industry | South Korea]]'s per capita income was $820, Malaysia's $930, Thailand's $420, and Indonesia's $300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. The country's "crown jewel" plantation economy fell into disarray due to nationalization threats and declining foreign investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.

## Reversal and Subsequent Shift Back (2012)

In 1977, a new government attempted to reform and open up the economy, aiming to attract foreign investors and establish a labor-intensive export development economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. This included establishing free trade zones, guaranteeing against nationalization, devaluing the currency, and limiting state participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. Growth surged from 2.9% to 6% annually between 1977 and 1983 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>, with manufacturing gaining prominence and ending the reliance on plantation agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>.

However, in 2012, under the administration of Mahinda Rajapaksa, the government reimposed export tariffs on tea and rubber, with the goal of once more encouraging domestic processingâ€”a return to import substitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>. This marked a reversal from 30 years of trade liberalization policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>.

## Impact in the Modern Era (2020s)

The economic growth observed after the civil war (2009-2013) was largely driven by debt-fueled public sector construction and infrastructure projects, rather than sustainable labor-intensive manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>. Manufacturing's share of GDP declined, and growth focused on servicing the domestic sector rather than export-oriented industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>. This shift reduced Sri Lanka's resiliency against external shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>.

::info | The [[impact_of_the_covid19_pandemic_on_sri_lankas_economic_crisis | COVID-19 pandemic]] served as a major external shock.
In 2020, the pandemic led to significant declines in garment, tea, and rubber exports, as well as foreign remittances and tourism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:49:00">[18:49:00]</a>. With its primary foreign currency generators crippled, the government again turned to import substitution for items like fertilizer to preserve remaining foreign reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>. This policy, in turn, led to domestic shortages, power cuts, rationing, and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>. The Sri Lankan rupee experienced a substantial drop in value against the US dollar, worsened by extensive money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>.

The economic hardship, though exacerbated by the pandemic, was "a long time coming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:00">[20:54:00]</a>. The reliance on unsustainable growth drivers, including debt-fueled infrastructure, and repeated turns to import substitution ultimately weakened the economy, leading to the current crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:00">[18:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>.

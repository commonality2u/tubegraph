Albania, officially the People's Republic of Albania, was once known as the most isolated country in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, this small Communist nation remarkably managed to align with, and then split from, three different major Communist powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. After its third and final split, Albania ferociously pursued [[albanias_economic_strategies_and_selfreliance | economic self-reliance]], which contributed to it becoming the third poorest country in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The period leading to its transition from communism was characterized by deep economic stagnation and increased public discontent.

## Beginnings of Communist Rule

Albania, a small country in Southeast Europe, was declared a "People's Republic" in January 1946, after the Communist Party, led by [[enver_hoxhas_leadership_and_stalinist_policies | Enver Hoxha]], won "free" elections with 90% of the vote as the only candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Albania is unique in Central and Eastern Europe for having been "liberated" without any Allied help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Immediately following the war, Hoxha's provisional government swiftly moved to purge opponents. Koci Xoxe, the Minister of the Interior, led a brutal purge targeting elites, anti-communists from the interwar years, and "enemies of the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Nearly 2,000 people were executed after sham tribunals, and others were sent to 39 newly built jails, often forced to work in mines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The Party established a secret police, the Directorate of State Security or Sigurimi, which at its peak had over 200,000 workers and kept millions of files on citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Diplomatic Isolation and Self-Reliance

Initially, Albania aligned with Yugoslavia, which had helped found the Communist Party of Albania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. However, tensions grew, and [[enver_hoxhas_leadership_and_stalinist_policies | Hoxha]], with Stalin's intervention, purged pro-Yugoslav elements, leading to a break with Yugoslavia in 1948 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Albania then joined COMECON, entering the Soviet orbit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

After Stalin's death in 1953, [[enver_hoxhas_leadership_and_stalinist_policies | Hoxha]] grew increasingly critical of Nikita Khrushchev's new policies, particularly his repudiation of the Stalin cult of personality and reconciliation with Marshal Tito <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. This led Albania to turn towards the People's Republic of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. By April 1961, the Soviets withdrew their considerable aid, which had made up 50% of Albania's economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

China attempted to replace Soviet aid, but geographical distance and China's own developmental struggles limited its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. The period from 1961 to 1965, during the Third Five-Year Plan, was one of the most challenging in [[communist_albanias_isolation_and_political_dynamics | Communist Albania]]'s history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>. To maintain power, [[enver_hoxhas_leadership_and_stalinist_policies | Hoxha]] intensified his surveillance state and personality cult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

The "love affair" with China ended when China began making overtures to the West, culminating in President Nixon's trip to China in 1971 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. Albania viewed this as a betrayal, and in July 1978, China cut off all aid to Albania, which at that point constituted half of the country's economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

### The Path to Isolation

With the final break from China, Albania entered a period of extreme self-reliance. [[enver_hoxhas_leadership_and_stalinist_policies | Hoxha]] declared Albania the only country still building socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a> and enshrined the principle of [[albanias_economic_strategies_and_selfreliance | self-reliance]] in the 1976 Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. For the next 12 years, Albania operated without foreign aid or credit, and joint ventures with foreign countries were forbidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>.

Key aspects of this [[albanias_economic_strategies_and_selfreliance | economic isolation]] included:
*   **Increased Exports:** Albania ramped up exports, primarily of oil, chrome ore, copper, and electricity, to acquire hard currency for essential investment goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. Trade partners were diversified, including a semi-relaxation of relations with Yugoslavia and COMECON, excluding the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **Data Control:** Economic data was tightly controlled; only positive figures were released, with other information deemed state secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>.
*   **Food Self-Sufficiency:** The country aimed for self-sufficiency in food production, draining swamps to expand arable land from 391,000 hectares in 1950 to 713,000 in 1985 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>. In 1976, Albania claimed to have achieved self-sufficiency in bread grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.

During this period, [[enver_hoxhas_leadership_and_stalinist_policies | Hoxha]]'s cult of personality reached new heights, with him being called the father of the nation and a second Skenderbeu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Religion was banned, and people were forbidden from traveling abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. The borders were heavily fortified with barbed wire and jamming devices to prevent foreign influence, leading to approximately 1,200 deaths of people attempting to escape over 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.

## Stagnation and Decline

Despite [[enver_hoxhas_leadership_and_stalinist_policies | Hoxha]]'s declarations of economic victory, Albania entered a deep and prolonged economic stagnation after the mid-1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. The economy grew at an average of 1.7% throughout the 1980s, effectively zeroed out in the second half of the decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>. Given a 2% annual population growth rate, the average Albanian became poorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>.

Factors contributing to this decline included:
*   **Drought:** A five-year drought from 1983 to 1988 severely impacted agricultural output and hydropower generation, crucial for exports and chromite mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>.
*   **Oil Glut:** A global oil glut crashed prices, hurting another major economic pillar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.
*   **Obsolete Equipment:** Oil production suffered as equipment from the Soviets and Chinese became obsolete and broken. Due to [[albanias_economic_strategies_and_selfreliance | self-reliance]], engineers attempted costly and inefficient repairs rather than buying new machinery from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

The populace suffered greatly. Families, regardless of size, were rationed just 1 kilogram of meat, 250 grams of butter, and 7 eggs per week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. The average monthly wage in 1984 was $15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>, and people were forbidden from keeping their own livestock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. Even in Tirana, the capital, water and electricity were only available for a few hours daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. A German visitor in 1984 noted the city was in "total darkness" at night with "no cars," and observed that Albanian technology on display was from the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.

## The Fall of Communism

[[enver_hoxhas_leadership_and_stalinist_policies | Enver Hoxha]] died in April 1985, after a long illness, having chosen Ramiz Alia as his successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. Alia initially toed the party line of [[albanias_economic_strategies_and_selfreliance | economic isolation]] but soon sought to introduce gradual changes to the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

In 1986, Alia made quiet outreaches to the West, establishing diplomatic relations with West Germany, Spain, and Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. He also reduced the number of offenses deserving the death penalty and relaxed travel restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

However, these small reforms were insufficient, and the Sigurimi began to lose its grip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. By 1989, Communist governments across Eastern Europe were collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>. In July 1990, thousands of people occupied Western embassies, refusing to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. Massive protests erupted in Tirana, leading to a breakdown of law and order and widespread violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>. Hundreds of schools, hospitals, and collective farms were looted, further damaging the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>. Industrial output in the third quarter of 1991 was 60% lower than the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.

Alia made a final, weak attempt at reforms, but they failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:33:34]</a>. Notably, he did not resort to violence against protestors, instead calling for free elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. The people tore down [[enver_hoxhas_leadership_and_stalinist_policies | Hoxha]]'s statues and demanded his name be erased from public places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:48">[00:33:48]</a>. In March 1992, the Democratic Party won power, marking the end of Communist rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>.

## Conclusion

Albania's pursuit of [[albanias_economic_strategies_and_selfreliance | total economic "self-reliance"]] ultimately led the country down a path of anti-development and into severe economic stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>. After 1992, Albania underwent one of the fastest transitions to capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>, though a profound need for further economic reform remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.

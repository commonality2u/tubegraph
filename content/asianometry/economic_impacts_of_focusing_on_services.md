From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

Hong Kong's shift from a manufacturing-based economy to one predominantly focused on services is argued by some to have been a significant mistake, possibly its biggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This transformation has led to various economic and social consequences, particularly impacting lower and middle-income residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Historical Context: Rise of Manufacturing

After the Chinese Civil War, industrialists from Shanghai, along with many refugees, moved to Hong Kong to escape the Communist Party of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. These industrialists brought capital and manufacturing expertise, re-establishing factories to leverage the large labor pool of Chinese migrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Due to limited land, factories produced lightly manufactured goods in high-rise buildings, such as plastic flowers, clothes, and radio assemblies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Hong Kong's manufacturing sector benefited from the 1950s trend of the United States and other Western nations sourcing manufactured goods from Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. By the early 1960s, Hong Kong was the largest manufacturer in the developing world, with low-skilled jobs helping people earn a living and build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Decline of Manufacturing

Competition soon emerged from places like South Korea and Taiwan, and rising worker salaries, combined with new generations demanding a richer lifestyle, increased costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Hong Kong's manufacturing industry offered little beyond cheap labor, lacking the technological expertise to produce native technologies or replace critical components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. For example, electronics OEMs spent 60% of their budget on imported integrated circuits from Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

As early as 1981, manufacturers sought government assistance for technological upgrades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Unlike Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea, which invested heavily in acquiring and naturalizing technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, Hong Kong, as a British colony, maintained a non-interventionist stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The British colonial administration had initially envisioned Hong Kong as a simple trading post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, with government revenue primarily from land leases rather than import/export taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This created an incentive for an economy centered on rising land prices and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. By 1949, Hong Kong's largest companies were banks, land development companies, and trading houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Many industrialists, like Li Ka-shing, closed factories to become landlords, seeing it as more profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Shift to a Service Economy

The lack of government intervention led manufacturing to move elsewhere, largely to mainland China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This resulted in a massive loss of lower and middle-income jobs in Hong Kong, and the city doubled down on finance and trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Hong Kong became a value-added intermediary for investments and cargo, facilitating trade between Western companies and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

In 1980, the service industry contributed 68% of Hong Kong's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. By 2000, this rose to 86.5%, and in 2019, it reached 93.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Construction is the second-largest sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Hong Kong today is primarily a service economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## Economic Consequences of Service Sector Focus

Hong Kong's leaders continued to promote the free flow of capital and trade between China and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. However, as China reforms and opens up, Hong Kong's intermediary role diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Competition and Decline of Key Sectors

*   **Logistics and Trade**: The Pearl River region has become a major logistics center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Shanghai and other mainland Chinese cities have reformed financial restrictions, attracting foreign capital to their ports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Hong Kong's share of China's trade with the world dropped from 60% in 1997 to 28% in 2007, and just 10% in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **[[hong_kongs_financial_services_sector | Financial Services Sector]]**: With transport, trade, and logistics declining, the [[hong_kongs_financial_services_sector | financial services sector]] became Hong Kong's primary growth engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Its contribution to the economy grew from 18% in 2000 to nearly 30% in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. However, China has been lifting foreign ownership restrictions in its banking and investment markets, allowing foreign banks and asset managers like BlackRock to operate directly in mainland China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Social and Economic Disparities

*   **Housing Affordability**: Hong Kong property prices are "obscene" and have far outpaced wage growth, making homeownership unattainable for most young Hong Kongers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. The government's inability to control interest rates (due to the USD peg) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:22]</a>, limited developable land held by monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, and stalled housing price reforms contribute to this crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Job Market and Wage Inequality**: The [[hong_kongs_financial_services_sector | financial services sector]] and other "high-value" industries do not provide enough jobs for the majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Less than 10% of jobs come from finance, insurance, and real estate (excluding construction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Nearly 85% of Hong Kong's adult population works in stagnant, domestic service-oriented companies dominated by large land developer conglomerates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This contributes to massive and growing wage inequality, with many over-educated service workers having few prospects for career upgrading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

### Investment Policy and its Consequences

*   **Stock Ownership for Wealth Building**: The Hong Kong government encourages stock ownership as a wealth-building strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. However, this primarily benefits existing wealthy individuals, as stocks are a way to "stay rich, not get rich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Hong Kong stocks have underperformed, with the Hang Seng Index Fund returning 3.56% over five years, compared to the S&P 500's 16.6% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Public Goods as Investable Assets**: To find new investment vehicles, Hong Kong has packaged public goods into assets, often at the cost of residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
    *   **MTR Privatization**: The partial privatization of the MTR railway company led it to prioritize profitable land management and advertising/telecom services over expanding its railway network, despite being a former land developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
    *   **The Link REIT**: The government sold retail and car parking facilities for public housing complexes to a real estate investment trust called "The Link" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. This move, while raising funds, led to rent increases that drove many shop owners into economic hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

## Conclusion

While Hong Kong's focus on services and finance has generated wealth for a segment of the population, and the economy's GDP has never been higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>, it has come at a significant cost to the majority, particularly the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. The argument is that Hong Kong missed an opportunity to maintain a sophisticated manufacturing sector and diversify its economy, potentially ascending the technology ladder to build and export sophisticated products like a "Hong Kong TSMC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Instead, it monetized public goods and its people into investable assets, leaving a significant portion of its residents without a clear path to economic security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

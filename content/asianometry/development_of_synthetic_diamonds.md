Traditionally, diamond prices have had little to no relation to their extraction costs. A diamond in a jewelry shop can cost around $550 per carat, with high-class diamonds reaching up to $20,000 per carat, despite costing only about $58-$60 per carat to mine, a figure that has remained stable for 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This inflated pricing is due to various supply cartels throughout history, which carefully manage supply to maintain steady prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This article details the journey of creating synthetic diamonds and their subsequent [[impact_of_synthetic_diamonds_on_the_jewelry_market | impact on the jewelry market]].

## [[history_of_diamond_pricing_and_market_manipulation | History of Diamond Pricing and Market Manipulation]]

Diamond overpricing is not a recent phenomenon. For centuries, market entities have controlled diamond supply to manipulate prices upwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Even in antiquity, when Indian kings dominated production, prices far exceeded extraction costs. For example, in the 1500s, a half-carat diamond cost the equivalent of 30,000 days of an average laborer's wages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

When Portuguese explorers discovered diamonds in Brazil in 1725, a flood of new diamonds caused prices to plummet by 30-50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The Portuguese Crown quickly took control of the mines and limited supply to stabilize prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

The most famous supply cartel was [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The discovery of the 21.8-carat Eureka diamond in South Africa in 1866 sparked a mining rush <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Production soared from 100,000 carats in 1870 to 3 million carats in 1880 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Amidst this boom, Cecil Rhodes founded the [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] Mining Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Rhodes managed the company efficiently, reducing labor costs from 36% in 1883 to just over 26% in 1887, by, for example, housing migrant workers in closed compounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This financial strength allowed [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] to buy out competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. By 1888, Rhodes and [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] had consolidated the South African diamond mining industry, imposing production limits to stabilize prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

After Rhodes's death, Ernst Oppenheimer, founder of Anglo-American, took over as chairman of [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Under his leadership, the company established the Central Selling Organization (CSO), which purchased all raw production from other producers at a fixed, profitable price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The CSO then resold diamonds in "sites" to jewelry cutting factories, called "sightholders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Sightholders were not allowed to negotiate, had to take the whole box, pay the full price, and could not resell rough diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Those who violated these rules were excluded from the cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

The CSO also took over marketing operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. In 1938, Harry Oppenheimer, Ernst's son, worked with N.W. Ayer of New York to create a marketing campaign that linked diamonds with romance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This campaign used influencer marketing, planted news articles about celebrities acquiring diamonds, and famously coined the slogan "a diamond is forever" in 1949 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This campaign made diamonds the pinnacle of luxury and a fixture at weddings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Early Attempts at Synthetic Diamonds

For centuries, people have desired to create their own diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. In 1797, Smithson Tennant demonstrated that diamonds were a form of carbon by burning them in oxygen, producing carbon dioxide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Recognizing diamonds as a denser form of carbon, early attempts to create them involved subjecting carbon to high pressure and heat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Notable scientists like James Hannay and Nobel laureate Ferdinand Frederick Henri Moissan claimed success in the late 1800s, but their results could not be replicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Hannay's "synthetic" diamonds were reportedly natural ones introduced by his assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The technology of their era was simply not capable of achieving the necessary conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

A more scientific approach emerged in 1915 when Gilbert Lewis and Merle Randall showed that diamond and graphite were in equilibrium at 10,000 atmospheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This led to mapping the carbon phase diagram, which showed that manifesting carbon as diamond requires not only 2,000 degrees Celsius but also over a million pounds per square inch of pressure, potentially less with a metal catalyst or solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This diagram provided a roadmap for the conditions needed to create diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## HPHT Method: High Pressure High Temperature

### Asea's First Synthetic Diamond

In February 1953, researchers at the General Swedish Electrical Limited Company (ASEA) produced the first synthetic diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. They built a device resembling a sealed hollow cube with a core surrounded by six anvils <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Hydraulic force pushed the anvils together to apply pressure. Heat was generated by igniting thermite with an electric filament, heating an inner graphite core to 2,000 degrees Celsius for about 1.5 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Initial experiments failed until the team added iron as a solvent inside the core, using a mixture of cementite and graphite surrounded by thermite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. To mitigate explosion risks, the core was wrapped in platinum and tantalum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This setup worked, producing small diamond crystals (about 0.1 millimeters across) at approximately 80,000 bar (1.2 million pounds per square inch) and 2,000 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. ASEA did not immediately publicize or patent their work, as lawyers advised that only the high-pressure equipment, not the diamonds themselves, could be patented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### GE's Success

In 1951, General Electric (GE) formed a group to study synthetic diamond production, as GE was the world's largest diamond consumer, using 100 million carats (20 tons) of grit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Their efforts were driven by supply chain concerns due to reliance on overseas sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Collaborating with Nobel laureate physicist P.W. Bridgman, the GE team modified one of his designs to create a "belt apparatus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This device, made of two cone-shaped anvils, could exert three million pounds per square inch at 3,400 degrees Celsius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. At these extreme temperatures and pressures, no additional solvent or catalyst was needed; graphite or other carbon forms would directly transition into diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The result was small crystals, about one millimeter wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

The news of GE's success initially threatened beliefs about natural diamonds' uniqueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:01]</a>. However, it was revealed that these synthetic diamonds were very small, posing no threat to [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]], which dealt in larger stones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Researchers later found that using a small seed diamond and tightly controlling heat and pressure could grow diamonds up to three carats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Yet, these diamonds were dark, low-quality, and exhibited an undesirable onion-like structure, making them more suitable for industrial grit than jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This gave [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] temporary relief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

Despite the rise of man-made diamonds, [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] maintained its cartel control throughout the 1950s and 60s, navigating revolutionary politics in Africa and new diamond discoveries in Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. The cartel even formed a semi-secret agreement with the Soviet Union, marketing and selling 80% of global output despite mining only 25-40% of the supply itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

It was not until 1970 that scientists could create a large, gem-quality crystal using the HPHT method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The key was allowing a week to grow a one-carat (five millimeter) diamond, as speeding up the process caused flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. This long, economically infeasible cook time, combined with the fact that these crystals were typically yellow and easily distinguishable from natural peers using UV fluorescence or absorption spectroscopy, highlighted the limitations of the GE-inspired HPHT method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | CVD Method]]: Chemical Vapor Deposition

Researchers began to explore growing diamonds in a low-pressure environment to avoid the expensive equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. From 1952 to 1953, William Eversole of Union Carbide conducted experiments where he heated carbon-containing gas in the presence of a seed diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Carbon atoms from the gas attached to the diamond surface, increasing its mass without high pressure. This technique is known as [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD), a procedure heavily used in the [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | semiconductor industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

Eversole's work was initially overlooked as the industry focused on the HPHT method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. However, in 1963, Dr. John Angus of Case Western Reserve University formed a team to replicate and continue Eversole's research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

The key to successfully growing pure, gem-quality diamonds with [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | CVD]] was **atomic hydrogen** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. During the [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | CVD]] process, not all carbon forms diamond; a significant portion manifests as graphite, an impurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Angus's team initially used alternating growth and cleaning cycles, etching off unwanted graphite with sulfuric acid (a method akin to [[technological_advancements_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | semiconductor manufacturing]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. A PhD student suggested using an atomic hydrogen stream from a tungsten filament for cleaning, which performed much better and allowed both growth and cleaning in the same chamber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

In 1971, Angus presented his work in the Soviet Union, mentioning his use of atomic hydrogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. A Soviet team made a second critical breakthrough: using atomic hydrogen not only during cleaning but also during the growth phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This suppressed graphite formation and converted existing graphite into gas, carrying it away from the diamond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

Their findings caught the eye of a team at the National Institute for Research in Inorganic Materials in Japan during the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This Japanese team used a hot filament or microwaves to activate a mix of hydrogen and methane, accelerating growth to a few micrometers per hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

## [[impact_of_synthetic_diamonds_on_the_jewelry_market | Impact on the Jewelry Market]]

One by one, the [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | CVD]] industry overcame its limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. By the 1990s, the industry could produce single-crystal synthetic diamonds in various colors, and these gem-quality synthetics began appearing in the jewelry market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

[[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] responded by investing in new detection methods, including UV fluorescence, X-rays, and advanced spectroscopy tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. While this worked for a while, synthetics rapidly eliminated this weakness, reaching a point where identification is only possible in a lab with very advanced tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

This technical improvement coincided with massive changes in [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] and the broader diamond industry throughout the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Japan's rise as a luxury jewelry market in the late 1980s boosted the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. However, the fall of the Soviet Union and new deposits in Australia introduced new competitors, dismantling the old cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. Post-Soviet collapse, former [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] customer Lev Leviev built one of the first truly independent competitors by purchasing diamond factories and striking agreements with the new Russian monopoly, Alrosa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Additionally, the Australian mining giant BHP, possessing one of the world's biggest diamond mines (Argyle), stayed out of the cartel, taking market share from [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

While [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] retained significant market share, by the turn of the century, it had to acknowledge it no longer controlled the entire industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. In 2000, [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] restructured into a more traditional luxury company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. They shifted marketing to promote [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]]-affiliated dealers and partnered with Louis Vuitton to open their own branded retail ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

In a significant move, [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] announced in 2020 that it would begin producing and selling its own synthetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This appears to be an attempt to embrace and benefit from the synthetic diamond industry's technological advances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

This market transition echoes the history of pearls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Natural pearls were once wild-harvested gems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. But in the 1910s, Japan pioneered cultured pearl farming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Consumers preferred these synthetic pearls for their rounder, more consistent look, and environmental benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. After a challenging market transition in the 1920s, virtually every pearl in jewelry shops today is cultured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

A similar future may await modern gem-quality [[cvd_method_for_producing_synthetic_diamonds | CVD]] synthetic diamonds: they are often more beautiful, ideal-looking, environmentally friendly, exploit fewer workers, and are produced far cheaper than natural diamonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. In essence, synthetic diamonds are transforming the diamond market, not by destroying it, but by shifting its value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. Previously, consumers paid for the scarcity of the stone itself; now, they may pay for the scarcity of the [[de_beers_and_the_evolution_of_the_diamond_industry | De Beers]] luxury brand, akin to a Louis Vuitton product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

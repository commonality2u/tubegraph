In 2016, Hanjin Shipping, South Korea's largest container shipping line, abruptly filed for reorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The company had once been considered the country's pride, a peer to Korean Air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Its unexpected insolvency disrupted markets and caused global chaos in the [[Container Shipping Industry Dynamics | shipping industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Historical Context of Government Involvement

From its inception, the South Korean government has played a significant role in developing its indigenous shipping capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Early Support and the [[History of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin Group's]] Rise

[[History of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin Shipping]] was established as a branch of the Hanjin Group, one of South Korea's [[Chaebol dominance in South Koreas economy | chaebol]] (large business groups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The Hanjin Group began in 1945 with founder Cho Chun-hun, focusing on transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. To fund its expansion, Hanjin turned to the national government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. President Park Chung-hee's economic growth plan offered generous loans from state banks to loyal companies that participated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Hanjin Group prospered from this cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

In 1977, Cho founded Hanjin Shipping, which was positioned as the business group's "Crown Jewel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. At this time, the Korean government was actively encouraging the development of its own container capacity through new policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. They explicitly subsidized Korean container carriers, though never more than $1 million USD per year in 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, and established the Korea Maritime and Port Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Hanjin Shipping benefited from this national policy push <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Response to the 1979 Oil Crisis

In 1979, the [[Impact of financial crises on South Korean business practices | shipping industry]] faced the 1979 oil crisis and a subsequent macroeconomic slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The Korean government responded by consolidating its shipping lines from 70 to 20 and offering aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. While Hanjin Shipping did not receive a direct public bailout, its sister company Korean Air temporarily stepped in to assist in 1986 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### The IMF Crisis and Neoliberal Reforms

The Korean export boom of the 1990s ended with the [[Impact of financial crises on South Korean business practices | Asian financial crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. South Korea, being one of the worst-affected, required a financial bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This aid came with strict policy changes, including:
*   **Liberalization of the Shipping Market**: The Korean government was forced to open its shipping business to foreign players, accelerating deregulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Korean shippers were suddenly exposed to the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Debt Reduction Mandate**: All business conglomerates were mandated to reduce their [[Role of debt in Daewoos collapse | debt]]-to-equity ratios below 200% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Hanjin Shipping, like many others, was compelled to sell off owned ships to pay down debt and charter new ones to maintain capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Hanjin, for instance, had to sell and then lease back 29 of its ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. While this improved debt ratios, it led to significantly higher operating costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This combination of higher operating costs and new foreign competition contributed to a long-term decline in Korea's indigenous shipping lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

## Hanjin's Final Crisis

After the death of founder Cho Chung-hun in 2002, the Hanjin Group's transportation empire was split among his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Cho Su-ho received [[History of Hanjin Shipping | Hanjin Shipping]], meaning the company could no longer rely on its larger siblings, like Korean Air, for support during tough times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### The [[Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on Shipping | Global Financial Crisis]] and Mounting Debt

In 2007-2008, Hanjin saw an opportunity to grow and invested in a new round of mega-ships, following industry leaders like Maersk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. However, they placed these orders at the "exact wrong time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. By November 2008, Hanjin had committed to orders for nearly a quarter-million TEU (20-foot equivalent units) worth of ships, a 40% increase in their fleet size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

The "Titanic economic slowdown" that followed the [[Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on Shipping | Global Financial Crisis of 2008]] caused a shipping overcapacity crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, with trade between the U.S. and Asia declining by 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Industry leaders like Maersk and CMA CGM reported significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Hanjin's debt soared, from 195 billion Korean Won ($165 million USD) in 2012 to 440 billion Won ($375 million USD) by 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. To pay for this, Hanjin began stripping itself of profitable assets, selling terminals, liquefied natural gas (LNG) tanker divisions, and bulk shipping divisions, leaving only the volatile container shipping line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## The Government's Decision

Korea Development Bank (KDB), Hanjin's largest creditor, demanded 700 billion Won ($615 million USD) in 2016, but Hanjin could only offer 500 billion Won ($440 million USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Hanjin's last hope was a government bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

Other countries had provided substantial bailouts to their shipping lines:
*   Denmark lent $6 billion to Maersk in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   Germany lent $1.8 billion to Hapag-Lloyd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.
*   France lent $660 million to CMA CGM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
*   China gave $9.5 billion to Cosco and China Shipping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

However, KDB was also dealing with another troubled shipping line, Hyundai Merchant Marine. They demanded both companies restructure chartering contracts, cut debt, and secure capital injections from their ownership families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Hyundai was able to comply, but Hanjin could not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

The Korean government's decision not to bail out Hanjin had "echoes of the Lehman bankruptcy in 2008" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. While the legitimate point was to avoid shoveling taxpayer money to "corporate fat cats" (especially given the "nut rage lady" incident involving the founder's granddaughter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, the decision marked a shift in policy. After many years of supporting the shipping industry as a core national interest, the Korean government decided it would no longer do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

## Consequences of Hanjin's Collapse

Hanjin's August 2016 insolvency "roiled the markets and lay utter chaos to the entire [[Container Shipping Industry Dynamics | shipping market]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
*   **Stranded Cargo**: 159 companies found their cargo unable to be moved, with $4 billion worth of goods stranded at sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This included critical Korean exports, as Hanjin shipped 40% of Samsung's electronics and 20% of LG's goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Walmart had 3,000 containers at sea or in terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.
*   **Job Losses**: The collapse annihilated tens of thousands of shipyard jobs in both Korea and the Philippines, where Hanjin owned the Subic Bay Shipyard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Trade groups and unions protested, but the Korean government remained firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

The contrasting approaches of other nations were highlighted:
*   **Singapore**: Faced with similar issues, Singapore chose to divest its national champion container line, Neptune Orient Lines (NOL), selling it to French operator CMA CGM for $2.4 billion USD shortly before Hanjin's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   **Taiwan**: In the fourth quarter of 2016, the Taiwan government bailed out its own two container shipping lines, Evergreen and Yang Ming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Taiwan's Deputy Minister of Transportation stated that the nation relies on shipping firms for its economic development, implying that Hanjin's collapse showed the necessity of government support "before the damage becomes uncontrollable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

## Conclusion

At its heart, Hanjin Shipping's collapse can be attributed to two main factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>:
1.  **Working Capital Crisis**: Despite owning profitable assets, poor chartering practices left Hanjin with unprofitable ships, and after the founder's death, there was no longer a "rich sibling company to step in with extra cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
2.  **Government's Decision**: The Korean government chose not to bail out the company, unlike other nations facing similar industry challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. This marked a shift from previous policies of supporting the industry as a national interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

After entering court receivership, Hanjin could not negotiate a way out, owing over 1.3 trillion Korean Won ($1 billion USD) in charter fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. The company declared bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>, and its last ship was sold for demolition in March 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

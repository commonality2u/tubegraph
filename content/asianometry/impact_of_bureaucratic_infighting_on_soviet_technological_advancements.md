From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 
The Soviet Union's ambitious plans for a nationwide computer network, known as OGAS (All-State Automated System), ultimately failed due to significant internal bureaucratic infighting and resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[20:43]</a>. This internal opposition, rather than purely technological limitations, prevented the realization of a project intended to transform the nation's [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | command economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## The Command Economy and Its Challenges
By the 1960s, the [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Soviet economy]] was stagnant and in desperate need of [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | reform]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | command economy]], where the state owned everything and economic activity was coordinated through directives, quotas, and commands, had struggled behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Issues included immense paperwork, distorted incentives, and frequent miscommunications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Many quotas were only met through informal "pushers" due to clogged formal channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

The death of Stalin in 1953 and Nikita Khrushchev's subsequent rise to power ushered in an era of [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | reforms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. A key change was the normalization and adoption of cybernetics, which Khrushchev praised as a "major tool of the creation of a communist Society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This shift encouraged the development of computer science and industrial automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, with leaders seeing computers as unlocking a universal problem-solving method that could address the ailing economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Early Proposals and Military Opposition
In 1958, spurred by news of the American SAGE air defense system, the Soviets began developing their own centralized computer networks for military purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. This military effort, which included "System A" connecting supercomputers like the M40 and M50, highlighted the potential of networked computers for civilian applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

Anatoli Kitov, an early pioneer in cybernetics, proposed the first effort to network the nation in 1958 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. After publishing the first significant positive article on cybernetics in the Soviet Union, he founded one of the country's first computing centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. In January 1959, Kitov wrote to the Communist Party Central Committee advocating for the acceleration of computer adoption for [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | economic planning]], and likely proposed a "Unified State Network of Computing Centers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. While his initial proposals for computer use gained support, the network concept was not immediately adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

Buoyed by this, Kitov sent a second letter in late 1959, proposing the linking of local factory and government computers (Automated Systems of Management, or ASUs) into a national "economic automatic management system" (EASU) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. This system envisioned powerful military computers, buried underground, accessible via terminals for civilian data processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Kitov saw this as a way to maximize the command economy's advantages and achieve immense financial savings by replacing the Soviet bureaucracy's production tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

However, this proposal directly challenged the status quo. Kitov's letter criticized Ministry of Defense leaders for slow computer adoption and suggested sharing military technology with civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The military, which did not appreciate the criticisms or the idea of sharing its classified technology, intercepted the letter before it reached Khrushchev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Kitov subsequently lost his job, party membership, and military honors in a "show trial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Glushkov's OGAS and Widespread Resistance
Despite Kitov's setback, the idea of a national computer network persisted. Victor Glushkov, head of the Kiev Institute of Cybernetics, took up the mantle, aiming to create the ASUs Kitov had envisioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. In 1962, Glushkov wrote to Khrushchev, highlighting the growing [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | technology gap]] with the West and urging accelerated Soviet computerization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This led to approval for research into economic reform through automated computer networks (ASUs) in 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

Glushkov's work culminated in OGAS â€“ the All-State Automated System for the Management of the Economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. His original vision in the early 1960s was an ambitious three-tiered hierarchy: 20,000 computer terminals/ASUs at the base, 100-200 regional planning systems, and a central planner in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. It envisioned a single computer network that would "rationally and automatically plan, optimize, and produce the country's National economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, effectively acting as a "nervous system" for the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

This grand vision faced significant resistance:
*   **Cost:** The proposed system was estimated to cost 160 billion rubles (1.4 trillion USD in 2016 dollars) and take 30 years to build <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, exceeding the combined cost of the Soviet space and atomic bomb programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
*   **Technological Gap:** While the Soviet military had world-leading [[soviet_computer_development_history | computer network]] capabilities, civilian computer technology lagged, and the military was unwilling to transfer its specialized systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   **Bureaucratic Threat:** Various players objected to the idea that their work would be dictated by or replaced by a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
    *   **Communist Party bureaucrats and industrial managers** felt threatened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.
    *   The **Central Statistical Administration** feared the computers' "objective collection of data" would curb their power to control information flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
    *   Glushkov's "all-or-nothing" approach required a complete [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | reformation]] of the country's management system, which was perceived as a revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

After Khrushchev's removal in 1964 and Brezhnev's reversal of many economic reforms, the OGAS project remained on the agenda due to high-level backing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. However, [[economic_and_political_factors_affecting_soviet_computing | Gosplan]] and the Central Statistical Administration actively rejected its "utopian Vision," seeking to control its resources for their own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

## The Final Blow: Ministry of Finance Intervention
The news of ARPANET coming online in 1969 caught the Soviet leadership by surprise and gave a new impetus to OGAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. Glushkov adapted his vision, proposing a less radical OGAS as a "universal information Bank" to organize and control data flows between national agencies, rather than directly managing the entire economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

At a pivotal Politburo meeting on October 1, 1970, Glushkov presented his new OGAS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. While some higher-ups spoke positively and hardliners remained silent, the Minister of Finance, Vaseli Garbazov, interceded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. Recognizing the immense political gravity of OGAS and its potential to erode his ministry's power, Garbazov dismissed it as a "silly project" and proposed a far more conservative counter-proposal, which ultimately won over the Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

The outcome was a state of limbo for OGAS: it was "neither fully accepted nor rejected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. Throughout the 1970s, some ASUs were built in individual factories, but they were often developed haphazardly and without standardization, making a nationwide unified network impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

## Conclusion
The proximate cause for the failure of the Soviet internet was the pervasive bureaucratic infighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>. Various leaders and power centers objected to its capabilities or hijacked it for their own agendas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Fundamentally, Glushkov's Soviet internet project was destined to fail because it directly challenged the established way the Soviet Union operated, a system that was only a couple of decades away from implosion itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

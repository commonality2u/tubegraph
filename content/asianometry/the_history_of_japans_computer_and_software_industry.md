Japan faces a significant digital trade deficit, importing far more in software licenses, cloud services, and other digital offerings than it exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. In 2023, this deficit reached approximately 5.5 trillion yen, or $37 billion, double the amount from 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While Japan is renowned for its iconic electronics hardware companies like Sony, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Panasonic, Canon, Sharp, and Toshiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, it lacks comparable software giants such as Microsoft, Oracle, Adobe, or SAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This article explores how Japan struggled to develop a robust domestic software industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Beginnings

Throughout the 20th century, MITI (Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry) actively sought to develop its computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Their primary competitor was [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]], which first entered Japan in 1925 by selling tabulating machines through a local trading company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. IBM established its own subsidiary, IBM Japan, in 1937, though its assets were confiscated during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

After returning in 1949, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] faced a new Japanese law in 1950 that mandated all foreign computer companies enter joint ventures with local firms, essentially forcing technology transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Examples include RCA with Hitachi, GE with Toshiba, and Honeywell with NEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] refused to yield 100% ownership of IBM Japan, leading to repeated clashes with MITI over market entry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Despite government pressure and import license leverage to favor local products, Japanese customers continued to prefer [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] products due to their clear technical superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Japan Software

In 1964, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] introduced its groundbreaking System/360 line of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This prompted MITI to sponsor the Super High-Performance Computer Project from 1966 to 1971, aiming to surpass the System/360 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Previous MITI efforts had focused solely on hardware, but the System/360's ability for software to run across all its machines meant software could no longer be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

To develop software for this project, MITI sponsored the Japan Software Company (日本ソフトウェア) in October 1966 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This joint venture included Hitachi, NEC, Fujitsu, and the Industrial Bank of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. While not Japan's first independent software company (that honor belongs to Computer Applications or CAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, Japan Software's objective was to create a "common language" and standards—essentially a universal operating system—for all Japanese computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Despite this ambitious goal, MITI only funded Japan Software with 25% of the project's 10 billion yen budget, indicating software was an afterthought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The company failed to achieve its goals due to ballooning requirements and lack of confidence, closing in 1972 after government subsidies ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Unbundling

Japanese hardware makers often relied on [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. A major milestone occurred in 1969 when [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] unbundled its software and hardware under the threat of an American antitrust lawsuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Previously, software was included as part of an overall computing services bundle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This unbundling assigned a price to software that was once free, enabling smaller software companies to compete against giants like [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. In the United States, this event is credited with creating the modern software industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Little IBMs

In Japan, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s unbundling led Japanese computer-makers to set up software subsidiaries and adopt [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s specifications through reverse-engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. As early as 1971, Fujitsu began selling an "IBM-compatible" mainframe that was cheaper and as fast as [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. A collaboration with Gene Amdahl, former chief architect of the System/360, further refined Fujitsu's compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Japanese companies rarely used the software as-is, often modifying it to display Japanese Kanji symbols (with each company having its own approach) and customizing it for customers' existing business practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. This customization locked in customers and allowed companies to charge more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Essentially, Japanese computer companies became "little IBMs," which arguably allowed them to survive against the persistent technological lag compared to American firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## The IBM Spy Case

The reverse-engineering of [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] software was illegal, but [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] did little about it for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This was partly because definitive copyright protections for software weren't established until the Copyright Act of 1976 took action in 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Furthermore, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] was preoccupied with a massive antitrust case from the late 1960s, aiming to break up the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This case only concluded in 1982, by which point [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] was rapidly losing market share to PC clones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

With the antitrust case resolved, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] turned its attention to the theft of its software by Japanese companies like Fujitsu, confronting them with allegations in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Hitachi and Fujitsu argued that since the System/360 OS was in the public domain when they adopted it, they could use derived software like the System/370 OS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. They also claimed that [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s software specifications were so widely used they constituted a standard and thus weren't subject to copyright protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

[[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] escalated the issue to the US government, leading to the arrest of 18 Japanese employees, some senior, from Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric in an elaborate sting operation in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The "IBM Spy Case" created friction between the US and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The US, in a recession and insecure about declining global competitiveness, saw it as theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Japan felt it was a setup to undermine its rise as a world power, citing their own copyright damages from firms like Nintendo and Sega <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## The Japanese Software Crisis

Despite the arguments, it was clear that Japanese computer firms copied [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s work, including its errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The case resulted in a settlement where Fujitsu paid a one-time lump sum and annual licensing fees of up to $60 million, agreeing to respect [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]]'s intellectual property rights going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

These software fees severely threatened the competitiveness of Japanese computer-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. In response, MITI attempted to amend copyright laws in 1985, proposing to limit software protections from the international standard of 50 years to just 15 years, though this failed to take hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This drastic proposal underscored the severity of the situation, as Japanese computer companies had built their business on foreign closed-source software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## The Good Programmer Shortage

The Japanese government recognized a serious "software crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Without domestic alternatives, Japanese tech providers would remain dependent on software imports from companies like [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] or Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. A major obstacle was a shortage of qualified and productive software programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

[[cultural_and_economic_factors_affecting_japans_software_development | Cultural and economic factors affecting Japans software development]] contributed to this shortage:
*   **Education**: Japanese universities lacked enough qualified computer science and software teachers, with most professors trained in other disciplines like math and lagging in adopting the latest compute trends for their curriculums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. A lack of English bilingual abilities and overseas experience contributed to this lag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Job Attractiveness**: Software engineering was not seen as an attractive job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The largest employers of software developers were the software development arms of larger business families, operating under a lifetime employment system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. In these roles, developers were not customer-facing, lacked career progression, received low pay, and performed unfulfilling work, mostly boring customization or maintenance coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. In 2010, an Infosys CEO estimated that 80% of Japan's software spending went to maintaining existing systems, compared to no more than 60% in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Lack of Startups**: Unlike the United States, which saw the founding of independent software giants like Adobe, Intuit, Synopsys, Cadence, Lotus, Electronic Arts, Microsoft, and Oracle in the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, such companies failed to emerge in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This was due to factors such as lack of customer acceptance, insufficient venture capital investment, an unwieldy lifetime employment system, and a cultural lack of initiative or risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This points to [[the_challenges_faced_by_japanese_software_startups | the challenges faced by Japanese software startups]].

## BTRON

One issue considered was the lack of a good "software environment" for Japanese programmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. With custom software dominant, there was no widely accepted platform or operating system independent of hardware that the industry could agree to use, leading to unproductive engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

One proposed solution was TRON, a domestic OS project initiated in 1984 by Dr. Ken Sakamura of the University of Tokyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. TRON aimed to create an "open" operating system to counter the growing influence of Microsoft's software and Intel's hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. It provided interfaces and design guidelines, similar to POSIX, rather than actual source code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

The most important TRON variant was Business TRON (BTRON) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. PC makers like Matsushita Electric adopted the standards and produced BTRON-compliant PCs for Japanese schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. However, in April 1989, the US Trade Representative office listed BTRON as a potential Japanese trade barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Although this mention was later removed, the damage was done, causing Japanese microprocessor companies—already entangled in the US-Japan semiconductor dispute—to pull out, leading to BTRON's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

TRON still exists today, with variants used in the Nintendo Switch's Joy-Con controllers and the Hayabusa2 space probe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. While Sakamura accused the US government of strangling BTRON, its lack of applications and general slowness likely contributed to its failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

## SIGMA & Unix

In 1985, parallel to the BTRON efforts, MITI launched the five-year Software Industrialized Generators and Maintenance Aids (SIGMA) project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Funded with 25 billion yen, SIGMA aimed to drastically improve programmer productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. The project developed standards, configurations, and applications for a line of networked Unix workstation computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

Although SIGMA fell short of its ultimate goals, it did facilitate the transition of Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC from their old [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]] platforms to Unix, licensed from AT&T <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. These companies, however, heavily customized Unix, creating their own versions like Fujitsu's UTS/M, NEC's Super-UX, and Hitachi's Hi-UX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This shift gave Japanese mainframe and supercomputer makers a "second wind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. In the 1990s, Japan produced some of the world's fastest supercomputers, challenging Cray Research, but this remained a niche success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

## The 1990s

The popping of Japan's real estate bubble in 1990 led to a prolonged recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Customers could no longer afford expensive software modifications, causing Japanese mainframe makers like Fujitsu and Hitachi to struggle and decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. The crash also eroded Japanese confidence, prompting questions about MITI's long-held industrial policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

MITI's traditional playbook involved funding domestic champions, encouraging them to reverse-engineer popular products, and producing them cheaper for export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. While effective for industrial goods like steel and automobiles, this approach failed for software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>. Software success relies not on "replication economics" but on widely held standards, networks of applications or users, and consumer familiarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. As consumer products became more software-reliant, Japan's mighty consumer companies struggled to compete in the open market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

## PC-98 & I-Mode

The personal computer (PC) is a prime example of a software-heavy consumer electronics product that Japan mishandled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. For over a decade, NEC dominated the domestic PC market with its PC-98, a hardware-accelerated MS-DOS version capable of handling Japanese language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. However, in the early 1990s, [[the_impact_of_ibm_on_japans_technology_landscape | IBM]], Microsoft, and Intel broke NEC's monopoly when a new version of DOS with Japanese language support opened the door for foreign software and hardware to enter the Japanese market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

This time, the Japanese government and MITI adopted a more globalized approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Fully exposed to market competition, NEC's overpriced and simple products crumbled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. While this was a boon for consumers, it cemented Microsoft's dominance in the Japanese market, and no domestic Japanese software maker has since credibly challenged the American giant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

A similar scenario unfolded a few years later with mobile internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Japanese telecom NTT DoCoMo launched "I-mode" in 1999, a 2G web browser and mobile internet service that gained over 40 million subscribers by 2003 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. NTT sought to export the standard abroad, marketing it as a new revenue stream for telecoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. However, i-mode failed to gain traction internationally, partly due to a lack of adoption by handset partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. The opportunity window closed with the release of the iPhone and its rich application ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

## Conclusion

Japan does possess a substantial software industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. However, its software landscape is largely dominated by custom-made packages with limited market potential or imported products developed abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Despite its industrial policies, Japan's most notable success in software is likely gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. While Japanese software programmers are reportedly skilled and do not demand American-scale salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>, and the Ruby language was created by a Japanese individual (though the Rails framework that popularized it was Danish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, Japan Inc.'s persistent lag in the global software industry remains a topic of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>. The optimal policy solutions to address this challenge remain elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

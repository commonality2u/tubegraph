The Soviet Union emerged from World War II with a renewed understanding of oil's importance, leading to significant developments in its oil industry and its role as a global energy player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

## Postwar Strategic Shifts
After the war, the Soviets aimed to control as much oil as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This strategic goal was reflected in their occupation of territories like Romania and their temporary control over Austria's oil industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. The Soviet Union relied on imported oil from these two countries until the mid-1950s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

To revitalize production, the Red Army confiscated oil technologies, much of it originally sourced from the West, and repatriated it as war booty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. There was a particularly high demand for pipes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

## Rise of the Volga-Ural Basin
Throughout the 1950s, the Soviets significantly invested resources into developing the oil fields of the Volga-Ural Basin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. This new focus meant that Baku, the historical oil hub, was no longer the priority, and its production rates suffered as a result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

The investment in the Volga-Ural Basin proved successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. By the end of the 1950s, fields like Romashkino, which spans 4,200 square kilometers (six times the size of Singapore), were producing more oil than all other regions of the country combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. The Volga-Ural Basin remains a significant oil production area today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

By the start of the 1960s, the [[soviet_oil_production_in_the_1960s | Soviet Union]] had become the world's second-largest oil producer, only behind the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Its oil production nearly matched that of the entire Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## [[economic_impact_of_oil_production_on_the_soviet_economy | Economic and Political Impact of Oil Exports]]
As oil production expanded, the Soviets began exporting energy to other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Initially, the primary purpose was to earn foreign currency to purchase essential goods such as wheat, meat, or advanced technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

Over time, these energy exports became a tool for the Soviet Union to assert its political influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. It served as leverage to keep satellite states and allies in line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. This tributary arrangement eventually contributed to the [[challenges_faced_by_the_soviet_economy_in_its_later_years | Soviet Union's ultimate downfall]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

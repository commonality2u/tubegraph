Carl Zeiss AG, a Germany-based company, is a critical supplier in the [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | semiconductor manufacturing]] industry, particularly through its partnership with [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Carl Zeiss manufactures the complex optic systems that are essential for the multi-million dollar photolithography machines made by [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Without these optics, [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] would not be able to produce machines for major chipmakers like TSMC, Samsung, or Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Carl Zeiss SMT: A Joint Venture

Carl Zeiss SMT is the division of Carl Zeiss AG focused on [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | semiconductor manufacturing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. This company operates as a joint venture, with Carl Zeiss AG holding the majority share and [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] owning a 24.9% stake in the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Their primary product is the optics at the core of the lithography scanners and steppers produced by [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

The semiconductor division of Carl Zeiss made 1.8 billion euros in revenue in 2020, showing 12% year-over-year growth, while other divisions experienced declines due to the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. This division now accounts for 30% of the Carl Zeiss group's business and holds significant strategic importance in German industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

## Optics for DUV Lithography

Carl Zeiss has a long history in deep ultraviolet (DUV) imaging systems, dating back nearly 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Carl Abbe, a physicist recruited by Zeiss in 1866, proposed the possibility of using ultraviolet light for microscopes as early as 1874 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. By 1899, the company developed a quartz lens suitable for UV microscopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

In the 1960s, Carl Zeiss began applying its microscope techniques to create lenses for microlithography, marking the first time such lenses were ever made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Microlithography demands precise control over light distortions across a large area to accurately transfer IC designs onto silicon wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. To achieve this, Carl Zeiss combined multiple smaller lenses into massive optics systems that utilize a "double bulge" structure to reduce field curvature, an optical problem that causes inaccuracies in projections over large areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Zeiss adapted its microscope techniques to enhance resolution for projecting IC designs onto wafers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. A significant breakthrough came in the 2000s with immersion lithography, a technique proposed by Taiwanese scientist Burn Lin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This method replaced the air gap between the wafer and the stepper with water, allowing foundries to etch structures as small as 40 nanometers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Carl Zeiss's leading products for this technique are the Starlith 1900 series, including the 1900i, which are among their top-selling products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The company invested over 450 million euros into a new factory to overcome engineering challenges for these optics systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

## Optics for EUV Lithography

[[overview_of_asmls_extreme_ultraviolet_lithography | Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography]] (EUV) is a disruptive [[technological_advances_in_lithography_tools_by_asml | technology]] crucial for today's cutting-edge process nodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The use of a new wavelength in EUV necessitated radical changes to the optics system, primarily because all known materials, including air, absorb high-energy UV light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. This means traditional lenses are not feasible, requiring Carl Zeiss to design an optics system composed entirely of multi-layer mirrors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

Carl Zeiss initiated its EUV optics work in 1995 with a micro exposure tool, a smaller prototype of the final system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Collaborating with Lawrence Livermore National Lab and Berkeley Lab, they delivered the first prototype in 2003 and refined the design five times over subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

In 2015, the first full-field EUV optic system, named the Starlith 3100, was delivered for [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]]'s ADT (Alpha Demo Tool) nxe 3100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. The Starlith is a multi-component system comprising:
*   Collector optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>
*   Aperture illumination optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>
*   Reticle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>
*   Projection optics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>

The process involves the EUV light source hitting the collector, which then projects the light through an aperture into the illuminator. The illuminator spreads the light evenly, which then reflects off the reticle (containing the IC chip designs) and is projected onto the wafer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. The Starlith 3100 pioneered the core mechanics that were later refined in subsequent releases, such as the Starlith 3300 and 3400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. These systems are now a critical component of EUV-based process nodes at 7 nanometers and lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## Strategic Importance of the Partnership

Carl Zeiss's partnership with [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] is unique and strategically vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Unlike [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]]'s closest competitors, Japan-based Nikon and Canon, which develop their own optics systems for their lithography devices, the collaboration between [[asmls_role_in_semiconductor_manufacturing | ASML]] and Carl Zeiss has proven more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. The complexity of these "fantastically complicated artisan systems" makes it challenging for any other company to catch up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

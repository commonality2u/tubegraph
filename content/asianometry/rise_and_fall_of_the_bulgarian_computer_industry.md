In 1989, Bulgaria alone exported more computers than all other Eastern Bloc countries combined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. It was also the sole COMECON country manufacturing hard disk memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Over 11% of all Bulgarian workers were employed in the production of computers and electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Bulgaria produced some of the world's first electronic calculators and personal computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, many of which became iconic brands in Southeastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The nation aspired to emulate Japan's economic success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Beginnings

Bulgaria, a middle-sized country in Southeastern Europe, borders Romania, Serbia, and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Its area is comparable to the American state of Tennessee, and in 2024, approximately 6.9 million people reside there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The modern Bulgarian state, the Third Bulgarian State, was established in 1878 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, initially characterized by a relatively poor, largely agricultural economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

During World War II, Bulgaria sided with the Axis powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Following the Soviet Union's entry into Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, the Bulgarian Communist Party overthrew the czarist government, abolished the monarchy, and established the People's Republic of Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The Party focused on rebuilding the war-damaged nation, modeling its economic policies after the Soviet Union's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Soviet aid included loans, raw materials, and the purchase of Bulgarian finished goods at favorable terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## [[impact_of_todor_zhivkovs_leadership_on_bulgarias_economy | Todor Zhivkov]]

After Stalin's death in 1953, [[impact_of_todor_zhivkovs_leadership_on_bulgarias_economy | Todor Zhivkov]] assumed leadership of the Bulgarian Communist Party, ruling for 35 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. His moderate rule provided the People's Republic of Bulgaria with unprecedented political and economic stability until 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The Party's economic policy prioritized the production of machinery and tools for heavy industry, such as mining, energy, and metallurgy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Zhivkov, who admired the Japanese economy, sought to guide Bulgaria along a similar developmental path, seeing heavy industry and electronics as Japan's top two sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

> "...that's what I've been dreaming about for years. Those who have interacted with me know that electronics was my weakness... I saw it as our future." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>

## The Bulgarian Computer Gap

In the 1950s, Bulgarian scientists began studying Soviet cybernetics and the economic potential of computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. While the Soviet Union and other countries started building their own computers (e.g., Soviet MESM in 1951 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, [[east_germanys_semiconductor_industry_history | East Germany's]] ZRA-1 in 1956 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, Czechoslovakia and Romania in 1957 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, Hungary in 1958, and Poland in 1959 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>), Bulgaria lagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Catch-up efforts were complicated by Western export restrictions, specifically COCOM (Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls), instituted in 1950 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. COCOM prevented Bulgaria and other Soviet allies from acquiring high-technology tools essential for industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Computing Center

In 1956, Bulgarian professor and mathematician Ljubomir Iliev attended a conference in Moscow on "The path of development of Soviet mathematical engineering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The Soviet delegation recommended that all socialist countries establish their own computing centers, noting that countries like the GDR and Czechoslovakia were both receiving Soviet equipment and building their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Professor Iliev conveyed this message to the Mathematical Institute within the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The government responded positively, and over the next two years, funds were raised and staff recruited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. In 1961, the Council of Ministers approved the creation of a new computing center within the institute, renamed the Mathematical Institute with Computing Institute (ИМ с ИЦ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Vitosha

At the beginning of 1962, Professor Iliev's team of students commenced work on the Vitosha (Витоша), Bulgaria's inaugural digital computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Completed in 1963, Vitosha was modeled after one of Romania's CIFA computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. It measured approximately 4 meters long and 2 meters tall, contained about 1,500 vacuum tubes, and featured a magnetic drum memory with a capacity of 4,096 40-bit "words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The Vitosha consumed around 12 kilowatts of power during operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Data and programs were fed via a tape punch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, and after processing data at 2,000 operations per second, results were output at 15 characters per second using an electrical typewriter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

Upon completion, Vitosha was showcased at the "Bulgaria Builds Socialism" exhibition in Moscow, where it demonstrated mathematical equation solving, graphical information presentation, and message spelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Unfortunately, the Vitosha no longer exists; a burst hot water pipe leaked onto the computer upon its return to Bulgaria, corroding and ruining its parts, leading to its disassembly for scrap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## ELKA and Early Success

Despite its demise, the Vitosha's exhibition in Moscow spurred significant political support for further computer development in Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. At the exhibition, the Bulgarian government agreed to import a Minsk 2 computer from the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Professor Iliev opposed this, advocating for domestically produced computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, and the arrival of the Minsk 2 in 1964 indeed dissuaded plans for a larger Vitosha-style machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Concurrently, the chairmen of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences and Mechanical Engineering Committee issued a report identifying electronics as a profitable export industry for Bulgaria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. They noted that electronics production is labor-intensive (especially for cheaper female labor) but requires relatively few raw metals, promising good returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The Council of Ministers endorsed this, allocating resources and foreign currency for industry development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, led by Professor Ivan Popov, chairman of Bulgaria's State Committee for Science and Technical Progress (DKNTP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Professor Ivan Popov

Professor Popov is widely regarded as the founder and primary driving force behind Bulgaria's computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Raised abroad in France, Germany, and Hungary, he maintained a strong patriotic belief that Bulgaria's future depended on a modern economy built on advanced technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Popov was a natural entrepreneur with a blunt, direct manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

In late autumn 1964, Popov presented Professor Iliev and the Mathematics Institute with a Sumlock ANITA calculator—the world's first all-electronic calculator—tasking them to produce their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. A small team found vacuum tubes, including a Dekatron gas-filled tube not available in the Soviet Bloc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Familiar with transistors, the team ingeniously re-engineered the design to use transistors instead of tubes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### Meet ELKA

This led to the creation of the ELKA (ЕЛКА) 6521 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, short for "electronic calculator" in Bulgarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The ELKA weighed about 8.5 kilograms, utilized Germanium transistors, and could perform square root calculations, integer division, and averaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. It was among the first transistorized, all-electronic desktop calculators of its era, alongside the American Friden EC-130, Italian IME 84, and Japanese Sharp CS-10A <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

In April 1965, the ELKA 6521 was demonstrated to Zhivkov and the Politburo, gaining their approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. The following month, it was exhibited at the INFORGA-65 show in Moscow, where Ivan Popov, fluent in multiple languages, sought to secure a high-volume sales contract from the Soviet Gosplan (state planning committee) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Popov bluffed, claiming Bulgarian scientists had achieved a calculator breakthrough and that large-scale factories were already established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Although a plant in Sofia called "Electronics" was being set up, it was not yet ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The Russians did not purchase the ELKA-6521, though a few other buyers did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

In 1966, the team simplified the 6521 design to create the smaller and cheaper ELKA-22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, and also produced the ELKA-25, likely the first calculator with an integrated printer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Popov again presented the new ELKA models to Gosplan, initially asking 1,200 roubles per unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. When Gosplan countered with an [[east_germanys_semiconductor_industry_history | East German]] offer of 730 roubles, Popov agreed to cut his price to 700 roubles, securing the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. [[east_germanys_semiconductor_industry_history | East Germany]] subsequently exited the electronic calculator business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

In 1967, Bulgaria established DSO IZOT, a new industrial conglomerate for developing and producing calculating machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. From 1967 to 1984, IZOT generated over 11 billion leva in export revenues (approximately $10 million USD in 1967 dollars) and 6.4 billion leva in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Exports extended beyond the Soviet Bloc to Switzerland and Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Notably, an ELKA-42 calculator using integrated circuits was displayed with great fanfare at the Osaka World Expo in 1970 as the first IC-based electronic calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. ELKA later diversified into cash registers, exporting thousands of these IC-powered systems to Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## [[bulgarias_semiconductor_and_electronics_industry_development | Bulgarian Semiconductors]]

Bulgaria's rapid catch-up in electronics was partly due to its semiconductor capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Concurrently with IZOT's founding, the Bulgarian government established the Institute of Microelectronics, with a design house in Sofia and a production fab in Botevgrad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. The Institute was led by renowned physicist Yordan Kasabov, a pioneer in Bulgarian microelectronics, who had produced the country's first domestic MOS transistors the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

Professor Kasabov and his team swiftly advanced Bulgaria's semiconductor capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. He designed the IC for the ELKA-42 and facilitated its manufacture using modern processes like photolithography, wet etch, deposition, ion implantation, and plasma etch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Around 1972 or 1973, Kasabov and Lubomir Antonov visited Silicon Valley, witnessing the rapid growth of the semiconductor industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. They encountered a highly integrated 4-bit IC, possibly the AMD Am9300, and recognized its potential for calculators and other devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Upon their return, they developed a series of microprocessors, including the CM-400, which enabled the creation of high-performing 4-chip calculators like the ELKA-50 series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

## Unified System of Computers

In 1969, the Soviet Bloc countries decided to produce a shared computer system: the Unified System of Computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Concerned about the COMECON's slow coordination, Professor Ivan Popov and his Soviet colleagues established the Intergovernmental Commission on Computing Technology (IGCCT) to ensure rapid development in the fast-evolving global computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

As a founder, Ivan Popov secured an important role for Bulgaria in the system's production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. The IGCCT assigned 105 production items to individual countries; Popov ensured Bulgaria was responsible for three of the most valuable: memory disks, magnetic memory tapes, and a processor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. To build proficiency, Popov arranged technology transfer agreements with Western companies, such as Fujitsu for memory tape design, and copied other items like IBM's disk drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. He coordinated the rapid, simultaneous construction of seven new plants for manufacturing various components for the Unified System computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

> I had the chance to participate in the selection of sites for the new plants and when he was giving orders to the industrial architects: "I need halls 12 meters high with all the communications underground (electricity, water, etc.). And we need it in six months!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>
> The architects often asked about what he needed these premises for, but Ivan Popov instead joked – "I will grow chickens". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>

The export and sale of these high-technology systems were highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Bulgaria secured a virtual monopoly, selling products like hard disk drives at very high prices, as no other Eastern Bloc country manufactured them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Bulgarian factories produced goods at large scale and high quality, acquiring advanced equipment from Europe and the United States, achieving profit margins of nearly 200-300% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. These electronics exports, alongside a lucrative [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet oil re-export deal]], bolstered the Bulgarian economy throughout the volatile 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

### Popov's Exit

Ivan Popov's successful development of Bulgaria's industry was ultimately cut short by his poor political skills and blunt nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. During debates for a new Five Year Plan in 1974, Popov proposed building mainframes in direct competition with the Soviet Union and [[east_germanys_semiconductor_industry_history | East Germany]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. His refusal to compromise with [[impact_of_todor_zhivkovs_leadership_on_bulgarias_economy | Todor Zhivkov]] led to his removal from the Politburo and banishment to Switzerland as ambassador <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

In its later years during the second half of the 1980s, IZOT competently ventured into supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. All [[innovation_and_industrial_challenges_in_soviet_computer_industry | Soviet Union]] geological centers were powered by Bulgarian computers like the IZOT-1014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. These sophisticated machines impressed even Americans, leading to exports to countries like India by 1988, seeking alternatives to American supercomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

## Microcomputers

Throughout the 1970s, Bulgaria produced mainframes and minicomputers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. More significantly, Bulgaria was an early adopter of the personal computing boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. In 1979, microelectronics engineer Ivan Marangozov assembled a team at the Institute of Technical Cybernetics and Robotics to copy an imported Apple II computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. The team successfully produced an almost-identical clone, the IMKO-1 (Индивидуален микро компютър (ИМКО-1) - "Individual Micro Computer"), with the ROM only differing by a name change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Key differences included a Cyrillic keyboard and reliance on slow tape cassette memory instead of floppy disk drives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

Only a limited run of IMKO-1s (at least 50) were produced, but they were extremely popular and functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. An IMKO-1 demonstrated its ability to control a robot arm at an international robotics exhibition in England, performing as well as minicomputers many times its cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

### Pravetz

The IMKO-1 served as a demo, leading to the development of a mass-production version, the IMKO-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. For cost efficiency, the IMKO-2 was modeled on the cheaper Apple IIe PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. It featured a Synertek 6502 CPU (a second-sourced clone of the MOS 6502), an optional floppy drive, and a BASIC interpreter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Production moved to a new factory in Pravetz, [[impact_of_todor_zhivkovs_leadership_on_bulgarias_economy | Zhivkov]]'s hometown, leading to the commercial variant being named the Pravetz-82, for the year production began (1982) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

Though still too expensive for the average Bulgarian, Pravetz PCs became reasonably accessible and quite popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. Production scaled significantly from 500 units in 1983 to 18,000 two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Many schools acquired these PCs, and numerous Bulgarians learned programming on a Pravetz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. By 1987, Bulgaria had over 500 computer clubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. Pravetz produced various 8-bit and 16-bit PC variants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. At its peak, the factory had three units and produced around 60,000 computers annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, many of which were exported to the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union]], other COMECON countries, and even some Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

## Missed Opportunity

By the late 1970s, Bulgaria was one of the top 10 largest electronics manufacturing countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. However, issues were on the horizon. The Bulgarian government ceased investing in microelectronics in the 1970s, possibly due to military and heavy industry priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. This led to serious limitations in Bulgaria's [[bulgarias_semiconductor_and_electronics_industry_development | semiconductor industry]], hindering its competitiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>. For example, while the Institute of Microelectronics developed a powerful IC for pocket calculators, the domestic fab could not produce it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. Consequently, IZOT had to import foreign-made ICs for its ELKA-100 series, which cost precious foreign currency and made Bulgarian calculators and computers more expensive than Japanese and Western alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

A potential solution was a technology collaboration with a Western company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. Lubomir Antonov's memoirs recall a Rockwell delegation visiting Sofia, likely after 1980, to discuss a semiconductor technology collaboration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. A deal was struck and awaited signing when a member of State Security abruptly intervened, declaring the contract would not be signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Rockwell's offer to extend their stay to resolve issues was rebuffed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>. Years later, Antonov learned that [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union]] authorities feared the deal would bring Bulgaria too close to the United States, harming their own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This was a devastating blow, ensuring more sophisticated Bulgarian computers would always rely on imported chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.

## Decline

By 1988, the Bulgarian computer industry employed over 169,000 people, roughly 12% of the country's labor force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. However, circumstances were shifting. In 1989, [[impact_of_todor_zhivkovs_leadership_on_bulgarias_economy | Todor Zhivkov]] lost power following a botched assimilation drive of the ethnic Turkish minority, widespread opposition to his long rule, and the loss of [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union]] support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. He resigned in November 1989 after 35 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.

In 1990, the Bulgarian electronics industry employed 181,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>. The following year, the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union]] began to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. With 95% of Bulgaria's electronics revenue coming from within the Soviet Bloc, and the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | USSR]] being the largest market, the industry lost its primary customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. Since many of its products were based on copied Western designs, Bulgaria had nowhere else to turn once the Soviet market vanished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

The electronics industry also suffered from its dependence on Western-sourced critical components; 30-40% of computer parts had to be imported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. As Bulgaria's currency weakened throughout the 1980s, these imports became prohibitively expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. Finally, the early 1990s saw the opening of Bulgaria's markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>, leading to a flood of extremely cheap South Korean and Taiwanese PCs that quickly displaced Pravetz computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. The factories closed down in 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. The formidable [[bulgarias_semiconductor_and_electronics_industry_development | Bulgarian computer industry]] collapsed almost instantly, with employment crashing from nearly 200,000 to just 30,000 people within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

Bulgaria's connection to the [[rise_and_decline_of_the_soviet_economy | Soviet Union]] both aided and harmed its computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. The Soviets were the largest customer, and Bulgaria's monopoly on valuable computer parts was a significant economic boon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. However, the Soviet link also imposed a massive handicap in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. It necessitated copying Western technology, which restricted exports, and prevented closer ties with the West, thereby capping [[bulgarias_technological_advancements_and_setbacks | technological progress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. [[impact_of_todor_zhivkovs_leadership_on_bulgarias_economy | Zhivkov]]'s vision of transforming Bulgaria into "another Japan" came tantalizingly close before vanishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>.

From: [[asianometry]] <br/> 

[[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han ethnic supremacy]] is an emerging point of concern on China's internet and cultural backwaters, seen as a serious problem due to its widespreadness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This phenomenon shares parallels with other ethnocentric ideologies, particularly white supremacy in the United States.

## Defining Ethnic Identity: A Constructed Concept

The definition of what it means to be Han is a complex question, much like determining what it means to be "white" in America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Historically, groups like Italians and Irish were not initially considered white upon their arrival in America, but this changed over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Similarly, Han ethnicity is subject to the whims of the current era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Being Han is not merely about a distinct nationality, ethnicity, or race, but a constructed bundle of cultural items, such as Confucian values or specific rites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This identity is often understood as an "I know it when I see it" concept, with the existence of groups like the Hakka and Cantonese serving as proof of its fluidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

In contrast, Han supremacists simplify this nuance, viewing "Han-ness" as a single, mono-race <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. They assert that Han people are the "core race in China" and that the interests of the Han race are intertwined with those of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. They claim Han people possess "five thousand years of direct racial inheritance" and "their blood is one of the purest in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. However, genetic reality shows Han people are "deeply intermixed" and have been "mixing for generations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, making them "a race of interbred mongrels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## Historical Revisionism and Blame

Both Han supremacists and white supremacists engage in historical revisionism to suit their narratives.
*   **Han Supremacists**: They seek to reject centuries of China's history and attribute its decline to "foreign" influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. They exhibit a "special dislike for the Manchu people," vigorously fighting to revise views of the Qing and Yuan dynasties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, painting the Qing dynasty and its Manchu leaders as bloodthirsty colonists who stole wealth, butchered Han people, and made China a "backwards country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This revisionism absolves the Han of any blame for China's decline, implying "the Han did everything right; the Manchu were the ones who got it all wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. This approach boils down complex historical events, like the Qing conquest where Han often fought against Han, into a simplistic "bad Manchu victimizing innocent Han" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **White Supremacists**: While not explicitly detailed in the transcript, the comparison drawn is that both ideologies employ "insane... conspiracy theories" that "none of any of this follow regular rules of logic," a "common thread" between Han and white supremacists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

## Competing Ideologies and Government Challenges

Both the United States and China, as nations with significant minority and majority populations, face similar racial issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

### The United States
The U.S. was founded on the principle of binding together "peoples of different races and creeds" under the concept of "freedom and pursuit of happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Though the nation initially struggled to live up to these values, Americans have strived to be more inclusive and expand the definition of what it means to be an American over the decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
However, a "darker school of thought" asserts that America's success is built exclusively on Christianity and Christian values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. This can further devolve into arguments for American white ethnocentrism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### China
China faces its own version of this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Inclusiveness**: One school of thought advocates for inclusiveness, suggesting that individuals can be accepted into Chinese society, and even the Han race, if they practice Confucian values and rites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This perspective views China as a "nation of many races" working "all in this together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Han Supremacy**: A "darker school of thought" argues for an inherent gap between the Han people and "the barbarians," a label with deep historical significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. To this group, "other races are born barbarians," their blood is barbarian, and attempts to assimilate them would be "a fool's errand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

Historically, Han nationalism helped topple the Qing Dynasty and establish both the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Early Republic of China leaders like Sun Yat-sen initially advocated for racial harmony, promoting the "five-colored flag" and the principle of "five races under one union" to prevent national division, drawing lessons from splitting empires like Russia and Austria-Hungary after World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. However, [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han ethnocentrism]] persisted, becoming a major social problem and a lingering issue for governance and the suppression of ethnic minorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) garnered support from China's ethnic minorities who were disillusioned with the Republic of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, making them a critical constituency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Mao Zedong himself strongly criticized Han leaders for sowing "feelings of estrangement" and bullying minority peoples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The PRC, therefore, emphasizes ethnic minority and racial harmony, driven by both ideological and practical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. The CCP even codified China's ethnic minorities in the 1950s, creating 56 separate nationalities and implementing affirmative action policies to help minorities achieve parity with the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. These policies include regional ethnic autonomous states, dedicated cultural institutions, preferential treatment in the national testing exam (Gaokao), and an exemption to the one-child policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

Despite these policies, significant gaps in income, wealth, and employment persist between ethnic minorities and the Han majority, similar to those between white and black Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. These policies have largely failed to close the gaps and instead have "cultivated resentment" from the Han majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Han majorities feel they are the "crucial driver of the Chinese nation and its glorious history" but are not treated equally to ethnic minorities, and are even seen as part of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Modern Manifestations and Government Response

[[han_cultural_movements_and_their_implications | Han cultural movements and their implications]] are visible in various forms, such as dozens of Han culture forums and websites that have emerged in China, Taiwan, and the overseas Chinese diaspora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. These sites advocate for the revitalization of certain aspects of Han culture while rejecting others for their non-Han origins, such as traditional Qing-era clothing (e.g., Manchu Qipao or Makwa) in favor of Hanfu, worn before "alien rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. While the Hanfu movement went mainstream partly because the clothes "look cute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, it and similar sites promoting Han culture "served as a gateway drug for harder versions of [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

The Chinese government faces significant headaches due to [[government_policies_and_ethnic_minority_dynamics_in_china | ethnic minority problems]], similar to other governments managing diverse populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. The government has attempted to dodge internal ethnic concerns and foster cross-ethnic unity by creating an "us of China versus them of the West" mentality, encouraging an "acceptable level of anti-foreign energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. This tactic may suppress [[han_ethnic_supremacy_concept_and_concerns | Han supremacism]] but its long-term health is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

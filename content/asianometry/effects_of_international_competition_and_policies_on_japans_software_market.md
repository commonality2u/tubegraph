Japan faced a digital trade deficit of approximately 5.5 trillion yen, or $37 billion, in 2023, largely due to importing significantly more in software licenses, cloud, and other services than it exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This [[Japans digital trade deficit in software | deficit]] is expanding, having doubled since 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. While Japan is renowned for its iconic electronics hardware companies like Sony, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Panasonic, Canon, Sharp, and Toshiba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, it lacks a domestic equivalent to software giants like Microsoft, Oracle, Adobe, or SAP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This article explores how Japan fell behind in the software industry.

## Beginnings and IBM's Influence

Throughout the 20th century, [[MITIs role in Japans computer and software industry development | MITI]], Japan's economic policy ministry, aimed to develop its computer industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Their primary competitor was IBM, which first entered Japan in 1925 selling tabulating machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Despite setting up IBM Japan in 1937, its assets were confiscated during World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Upon its return in 1949, a new Japanese law in 1950 mandated that foreign computer companies enter joint ventures (JVs) with local companies, essentially forcing technology transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Examples include RCA with Hitachi, GE with Toshiba, and Honeywell with NEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, IBM refused to relinquish 100% ownership of IBM Japan, leading to repeated clashes with [[MITIs role in Japans computer and software industry development | MITI]] over market introductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Even when IBM's computers were permitted, government officials pushed customers to buy local products, leveraging import licenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Nevertheless, Japanese customers often favored IBM products due to their clear technical superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Japan Software Company

In response to IBM's breakthrough System/360 line of computers in 1964 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, [[MITIs role in Japans computer and software industry development | MITI]] sponsored the Super High-Performance Computer Project from 1966 to 1971 to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. While prior [[MITIs role in Japans computer and software industry development | MITI]] efforts focused on hardware, the System/360's software compatibility forced a shift in focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

To develop software for this project, [[MITIs role in Japans computer and software industry development | MITI]] sponsored the Japan Software Company in October 1966, a joint venture involving Hitachi, NEC, Fujitsu, and the Industrial Bank of Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Its ambitious goal was to create a "common language" software and universal operating system for all Japanese computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. However, [[MITIs role in Japans computer and software industry development | MITI]] only funded 25% of the project's 10 billion yen budget, indicating software was an afterthought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The Japan Software Company ultimately failed in 1972 due to ballooning requirements, lack of outside sales, and loss of employee confidence after government subsidies ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## IBM Unbundling and "Little IBMs"

In 1969, facing an American anti-trust lawsuit, IBM unbundled its software and hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Previously, software was included as part of an overall computing service bundle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This [[Impact of IBM unbundling on Japanese software industry | unbundling]] priced software separately, allowing smaller software companies to compete with giants like IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. In the United States, this decision largely created the modern software industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

However, in Japan, a different outcome emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. IBM's unbundling enabled Japanese computer makers to establish software subsidiaries and adopt IBM's specifications through reverse-engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Fujitsu, for instance, began selling "IBM-compatible" mainframes by 1971, which were marketed as faster and cheaper than IBM's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. These Japanese companies often modified the software to display Japanese kanji symbols and to fit customers' existing business practices, which helped lock in customers and allowed for higher charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This effectively turned Japanese computer companies into "little IBMs," a strategy that arguably allowed them to survive despite persistent technological lags against American firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## The IBM Spy Case and Japanese Software Crisis

The use of reverse-engineered IBM software by Japanese companies was illegal, but IBM did little about it for over a decade, partly because definitive copyright protections for software were not enacted until 1978 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Furthermore, IBM was preoccupied with a titanic anti-trust case against it in the US, which only ended in 1982 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

With the anti-trust case resolved, IBM confronted Fujitsu, Hitachi, and other Japanese companies in 1982 regarding the theft of its software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. The Japanese firms argued that the System/360 OS was in the public domain when they adopted it, and that IBM's software specifications were so widely used they constituted a standard, not subject to copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. IBM then escalated the issue to the US government, leading to the "IBM Spy Case" in the early 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This involved an elaborate sting operation and the arrest of 18 Japanese employees from Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric for paying to steal IBM technical secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This case sparked resentment on both sides of the Pacific <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

Ultimately, Japanese computer firms were found to have copied IBM's work, even its errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Fujitsu settled, paying a lump sum and annual licensing fees as high as $60 million, and agreed to respect IBM's intellectual property rights going forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. These substantial software fees threatened the competitiveness of the Japanese computer makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. In 1985, [[MITIs role in Japans computer and software industry development | MITI]] even proposed amending copyright laws to limit software protection to 15 years, down from the international standard of 50 years, though this failed to pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This demonstrated the seriousness of the "Japanese software crisis" where companies built businesses on closed-source foreign software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## The Good Programmer Shortage

A significant hurdle was a persistent shortage of qualified and productive software programmers in Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   **Education**: Japanese universities lacked sufficient qualified computer science and software teachers, with many professors trained in other disciplines like math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. They also lagged in adopting the latest computing trends, partly due to a lack of English bilingual abilities and overseas experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Job Attractiveness**: Software engineering was not considered an attractive career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The largest employers were software development arms of larger business families operating on a lifetime employment system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Developers often lacked customer-facing roles, career progression, decent pay, and fulfilling work, typically engaging in boring customization or maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. As of 2010, an estimated 80% of Japan's software spending went to maintaining existing systems, compared to no more than 60% in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **Lack of [[Challenges in Japanese software talent and startups | Software Startups]]**: Unlike the United States, where the 1980s saw the emergence of independent software giants like Adobe, Intuit, Synopsys, Cadence, Lotus, Electronic Arts, Microsoft, and Oracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, Japan failed to foster such companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This was attributed to a lack of customer acceptance, insufficient venture capital, an unwieldy lifetime employment system, and a cultural lack of initiative or risk-taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Domestic OS Projects: TRON and SIGMA

Concerns about Japanese programmers lacking a "software environment" and a widely accepted, hardware-independent operating system led to new initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### TRON
One such project was TRON, a domestic OS initiated in 1984 by Dr. Ken Sakamura of the University of Tokyo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. It aimed to create an "open" operating system to challenge the growing dominance of Microsoft's software and Intel's hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. TRON provided interfaces and design guidelines, rather than source code, similar to POSIX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. The Business TRON (BTRON) variant was adopted by PC makers like Matsushita Electric for use in Japanese schools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

However, in April 1989, the US Trade Representative's office specifically listed BTRON as a potential Japanese trade barrier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Although the mention was later removed, Japanese microprocessor companies, already embroiled in US-Japan semiconductor disputes, withdrew their support, causing BTRON's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. While TRON still exists in niche applications like Nintendo Switch Joy-Cons and the Hayabusa2 space probe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, its lack of applications and general slowness likely contributed to its initial struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

### SIGMA & Unix
In 1985, [[MITIs role in Japans computer and software industry development | MITI]] launched the five-year, 25-billion-yen Software Industrialized Generators and Maintenance Aids (SIGMA) project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Its goal was to drastically improve programmer productivity by developing standards, configurations, and applications for networked Unix workstation computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. While SIGMA fell short of its ultimate goals, it led Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC to transition from IBM platforms to Unix, licensed from AT&T <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. However, they heavily customized Unix into their own variants like Fujitsu's UTS/M, NEC's Super-UX, and Hitachi's Hi-UX <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This adoption of Unix gave Japanese mainframe and supercomputer makers a "second wind," allowing Japan to produce some of the world's fastest supercomputers in the 1990s, though this remained a niche success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

## The 1990s and Market Liberalization

The popping of Japan's real estate bubble in 1990 led to a prolonged recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Customers could no longer afford expensive software modifications, causing a slow decline for major Japanese mainframe makers like Fujitsu and Hitachi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. The crash also eroded Japanese confidence, bringing into question long-held [[MITIs role in Japans computer and software industry development | MITI]] principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. [[MITIs role in Japans computer and software industry development | MITI]]'s traditional playbook of funding domestic champions to reverse-engineer products and produce them cheaper, which worked for industrial items like steel and automobiles, proved ineffective for software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Software success relies on widely held standards, application networks, and consumer familiarity, not just replication economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

### PC-98 & I-Mode
The PC market exemplified this shift. For over a decade, NEC dominated Japan's domestic PC market with its PC-98, which featured hardware-accelerated MS-DOS capable of handling Japanese language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. However, in the early 1990s, IBM, Microsoft, and Intel introduced a new version of DOS with Japanese language support, opening the market to foreign-made software and hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This time, the Japanese government and [[MITIs role in Japans computer and software industry development | MITI]] opted for a more globalized approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. NEC's overpriced products crumbled, cementing Microsoft's dominance in the Japanese market, and no domestic Japanese software maker has since mounted a credible challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

A similar scenario unfolded with NTT DoCoMo's I-mode, a 2G mobile web browser launched in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. It gained over 40 million subscribers by 2003, and NTT sought to export it as a revenue generator for telecoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. However, I-mode failed to gain traction abroad, partly due to a lack of adoption by handset partners, and its window of opportunity closed with the release of the iPhone and its rich application ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

## Conclusion

Japan still has a large software industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. However, its software landscape remains dominated by either custom-made packages with limited resale potential or imported products developed abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Despite extensive industrial policies, Japan's strongest area in software is arguably gaming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. While issues on the talent side are clearing up, with Japanese software programmers noted for their skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>, Japan Inc.'s continued lag in the global software industry remains a persistent topic of discussion across technological eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

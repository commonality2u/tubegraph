Despite wheat not being a traditional part of its cuisine, Nigeria consumed approximately 3 billion servings of instant noodles in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The Indonesian noodle brand Indomie is exceptionally popular in Nigeria, likely being the single most popular packaged food in all of Africa, even appearing in rap lyrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Entry into the Nigerian Market

The journey of Indomie into Nigeria began in 1988, when [[the_role_of_tolaram_corporation_in_indomies_nigerian_success | Tolaram Corporation]], a Singaporean company with a long-term investment philosophy, started importing Indomie noodles from Indofood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. The idea came from Haresh Aswani, who had observed Indomie's success in Indonesia and believed it could be replicated in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Nigeria's large, young, and fast-growing urban population seemed similar to Indonesia's, making it an attractive market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

### Initial Challenges and Adaptations
The initial entry was met with significant hurdles:
*   **Lack of familiarity**: Nigerians were unfamiliar with wheat-based noodles and initially mistook them for "worms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   **Cooking and consumption**: Consumers, accustomed to eating with their hands, did not know how to cook or eat the noodles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
*   **Slow sales**: For the first six years after market entry in 1988, sales volumes were low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Economic Instability**: Nigeria faced a foreign exchange crisis in the early 1980s due to high spending and oil revenue shortfalls, operating under military rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

> To address the initial confusion, [[the_role_of_tolaram_corporation_in_indomies_nigerian_success | Tolaram]] positioned Indomie as a convenient food for children, targeting busy mothers with five children on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. They hired people to demonstrate how to prepare Indomie in supermarkets, schools, and even during traffic jams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## Local Production and Overcoming Obstacles

Despite slow initial sales, [[the_role_of_tolaram_corporation_in_indomies_nigerian_success | Tolaram]] management remained committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Recognizing that freight costs accounted for about 40% of the product's cost, they decided to localize production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

In 1995, a joint venture with Indofood was formed, called De United Foods, granting [[the_role_of_tolaram_corporation_in_indomies_nigerian_success | Tolaram]] the right to manufacture, brand, and sell Indomie in all of West Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. They built their first noodle factory in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.

### Road to Profitability
The joint venture continued to lose money for several years, leading Indofood to consider pulling out, but [[the_role_of_tolaram_corporation_in_indomies_nigerian_success | Tolaram]] requested one more year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. In June 2000, they launched a new flavor, Onion Chicken, accompanied by a major marketing campaign with giveaways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

> [!success] Turning Point
> The Onion Chicken flavor, along with other localized varieties like Pepper Chicken and Jollof, became a massive hit, catapulting Indomie to become the most popular noodle brand in Nigeria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

It took 10 years for Indomie to become profitable in Nigeria and 12 years to generate over $10 million in revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. Afterward, sales began doubling each year, reaching a billion packs a month by 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

## Long-Term Investment and Expansion
Indomie's success paved the way for [[evolution_of_tolaram_into_a_consumer_goods_and_infrastructure_leader | Tolaram]] to transform its business model.

### Vertical Integration
To ensure a consistent supply of raw materials, [[evolution_of_tolaram_into_a_consumer_goods_and_infrastructure_leader | Tolaram]] began vertically integrating. This involved opening their own:
*   Packaging plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>
*   Seasoning plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>
*   Flour mills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>
*   Oil mills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>

### Infrastructure Development
Recognizing Nigeria's poor infrastructure, [[evolution_of_tolaram_into_a_consumer_goods_and_infrastructure_leader | Tolaram]] also took on the responsibility of providing essential services that other companies often take for granted, such as electricity, water, and waste processing for its operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

### Distribution and Market Dominance
[[the_role_of_tolaram_corporation_in_indomies_nigerian_success | Tolaram]]'s formidable distribution company, Multipro, has been crucial to Indomie's success, making it an attractive partner for other consumer brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. Indomie maintains its dominant position in the Nigerian market despite facing over 17 new competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. Today, there are multiple Indomie plants across Africa, supplying not only Nigeria but also Ghana, Egypt, and Eswatini <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

Seymour Cray Jr. dedicated his life to pushing the boundaries of computing, aiming to "Build the biggest computer in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. His singular focus led him to become a foundational figure in the development of [[history_and_evolution_of_the_cray_supercomputer | supercomputers]], consistently designing machines that led their field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## Beginnings and Early Career

Born in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin in 1925, Seymour Cray's early life was marked by a keen interest in science and engineering, fostered by his civil engineer father <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. He pursued electrical engineering and applied math at the University of Minnesota after serving as an electrician in the army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

In 1950, Cray joined Engineering Research Associates (ERA) in St. Paul, Minnesota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. ERA was a company covertly set up by the US Navy to continue the work of their elite World War II code-breaking team, transitioning from Axis codes to [[impact_of_cold_war_technology_race_on_computing | Soviet codes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. ERA's early products were code-breaking machines, but they quickly moved towards general-purpose computers, leveraging technologies like magnetic drum memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Their ERA 1101 was a commercialized version of a device sold to a precursor of the NSA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. During the 1950s, Minnesota, with its strong military presence, was a premier computing center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

At ERA, Cray, despite being only 25, quickly demonstrated his talent, confidence, focus, and brilliance in understanding binary numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. He was tasked with producing the control system for the ERA 1103, a role requiring deep understanding of the computer's architecture to efficiently execute programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. Cray's intense, solitary work style sometimes led to colleagues being "scrayed" (reassigned if not meeting his standards), but he was generally liked and respected for his genius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Remington Rand and Sperry Rand

In 1951, ERA was sold to Remington Rand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Remington Rand had also acquired Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation, known for creating ENIAC (the first programmable digital computer) and EDVAC (pioneering the stored program computer design underpinning the Von Neumann architecture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. While Eckert–Mauchly focused on business computing, ERA concentrated on scientific computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

Tensions arose due to the differing needs of business and scientific computing at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Business computers required simple, large-scale operations with less accuracy, while scientific computers needed complex, highly accurate calculations that might run for hours to produce a single result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The groups held mutual disdain, with the Philadelphia-based Eckert–Mauchly viewing ERA as "farmers" and ERA seeing them as "theoreticians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

The situation worsened when Remington Rand merged with Sperry Corporation to become Sperry Rand in 1955, forcing the units into one Univac division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Recognizing the company's capital struggles and mismanaged potential compared to IBM, William Norris, ERA's VP of Operations, left Sperry Rand in 1957 to found [[history_of_sun_microsystems | Control Data Corporation]] (CDC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Cray, seeing his project categorized as "999 Miscellaneous and Other," joined Norris, signaling his dissatisfaction with the corporate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Control Data Corporation (CDC)

[[history_of_sun_microsystems | CDC]] started in July 1957 with little more than its employees and a vague idea to build computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. It famously IPO'd by selling shares on the street for a dollar each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Despite initial skepticism from prominent investors like Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, CDC's early success created significant wealth in Minnesota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### The CDC 1604: A Scientific Supercomputer

As CDC's most technical person, Cray convinced his co-founders to focus on scientific computers, targeting universities and nuclear weapons research labs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. These clients needed immense computing power ("serious compute") for simulations, especially for complex tasks like simulating nuclear detonations, which required stepping through equations every microsecond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

Cray believed he could build such a machine affordably using transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. He famously used reject bipolar transistors from a local electronics shop, pairing them in a "Darlington pair" to amplify their weak signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:09]</a>. This experience taught him that clever design could compensate for substandard components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

In 1958, CDC secured a deal with the US Navy for what became the CDC 1604 computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Launched in 1960 at a price of $990,000 (about $10.4 million today), the 1604, operating at 0.2 megahertz, became the most powerful commercially-available computer of its time – a true supercomputer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. While other powerful machines existed, like UNIVAC's LARC and IBM's 7030 STRETCH (designed by Gene Amdahl), these were largely made-to-order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:12:01]</a>. Control Data, with the 1604, turned the supercomputer into a commercially successful category, selling units to various institutions globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### The CDC 6600: A Leap in Performance

Following the 1604, Cray insisted on building an even faster machine, despite management's desire to enter the business data processing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. His motivation stemmed from the scientific community's burgeoning interest in Finite Element Analysis, a computational modeling technique that required virtually infinite compute power for complex simulations like weather or nuclear explosions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:31]</a>. Cray famously threatened to leave if he couldn't pursue this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

Norris agreed to split the teams, allowing the 35-year-old Cray and his team to open a dedicated lab in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, to work on a machine 15 times faster than the 1604 – the CDC 6600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:14:07]</a>.

The CDC 6600 incorporated several [[technological_innovations_and_challenges_in_supercomputer_design | technological innovations]]:
*   **Silicon Planar Transistors**: Sourced from Fairchild, these offered a 5x speed boost over germanium transistors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.
*   **Cordwood Modules**: Cray abandoned the slower building-block approach for denser, custom "cordwood modules" with shorter wires, which improved speed but necessitated freon gas cooling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>.
*   **Parallelism**: The 6600 featured 11 individual computers sharing central memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Ten handled "housekeeping" functions and peripherals, freeing the eleventh for high-speed mathematical computation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
*   **Simplified Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)**: Cray streamlined the ISA, removing instructions unrelated to scientific computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This allowed for "pipelining" tasks, breaking down jobs into smaller, simultaneously executable parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

Delivered in 1964, the CDC 6600 was three times faster than IBM's 7030, stunning Thomas J. Watson Jr. and causing him to question how "34 people - including the janitor" beat IBM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. The answer lay in Cray's willingness to sacrifice compatibility for speed, a luxury IBM, committed to its existing architecture, could not afford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

### Departure from CDC

Despite the 6600's success, internal tensions persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. CDC management increasingly focused on peripherals, software, and even consumer finance (acquiring Commercial Credit) as the company's future, rather than just hardware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. While the CDC 7600 (five times faster than the 6600) followed, it sold poorly due to frequent breakdowns and a weak economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

Cray''s next project, the 8600, faced immense challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. To achieve an 8-nanosecond clock cycle, components had to be squeezed incredibly close, leading to insurmountable cooling problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. In 1971, amidst CDC's expensive antitrust lawsuit against IBM and dwindling cash flow, Cray was asked to cut expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Unwilling to compromise his design, he even cut his own salary to minimum wage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. When Norris insisted they couldn't restart the 8600 due to pre-sold systems, Cray decided to leave and start his own company in 1972 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

## Cray Research and the Cray-1

Seymour Cray founded [[history_and_evolution_of_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray Research]] with $2.5 million, aiming to build the biggest computer, one at a time, like a master artisan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. In a show of goodwill, William Norris and CDC even invested $250,000, calling it "heart money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

### The Cray-1: A New Era of Supercomputing

For his first machine, the Cray-1, Seymour focused on **vector processing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. Unlike scalar processors that handle single data items one at a time, vector processors process single-dimension arrays of data (vectors) simultaneously, drastically reducing the number of instructions needed for repetitive calculations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

Cray learned from CDC's failed STAR-100 vector computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. He identified two key flaws: slow scalar processing bottlenecking the system, and inefficient loading/storing of vectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. To address the latter, he introduced "vector registers," fast intermediate memory systems similar to cache memory, which significantly improved speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

The Cray-1 also marked Cray's first adoption of integrated circuits (ICs) for increased density and reduced wiring, making the machine much smaller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. True to his preference for reliable, older technologies, ICs were mature by 1976 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. However, for memory, he broke his rule, using bipolar semiconductor memory chips for their lower cost, higher density, and reduced power consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

With a clock cycle of 12.5 nanoseconds, the Cray-1 was five times faster than the CDC 7600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>. This extreme speed necessitated all wires to be less than four feet long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. Its iconic circular shape accommodated the new cooling scheme, and its distinctive design differentiated it from conventional gray boxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

Released in 1976, the Cray-1 generated immense buzz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. Over 100 units were sold to government and university labs, driving explosive revenue growth for [[history_and_evolution_of_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray Research]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. IBM didn't attempt to compete, and Control Data, hampered by its own complexities (like the Cyber-205), struggled to keep up, eventually selling off its assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:24:10]</a>.

## Later Career and Challenges

As the Cray-1 was in its late development stages, Seymour Cray already had his sights set on the even more ambitious Cray-2, targeting a clock speed three to six times faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. However, the success of [[history_and_evolution_of_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray Research]] brought new pressures. Its IPO and rapid growth (from 300 to 5,000 employees at its peak in Chippewa Falls) meant Seymour had to focus on business needs rather than pure research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

Customers also began prioritizing software portability, a trend driven by the popularity of the [[the_multics_project_and_its_impact_on_unix | Unix operating system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:46">[00:25:46]</a>. They preferred iterations on the Cray-1 (like the 1S) over a radically different Cray-2 that would demand software rewrites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. Facing this familiar dilemma, Cray Research's management adopted a dual approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>.

In 1981, Seymour Cray stepped down as Chairman to become an independent contractor, moving to Boulder, Colorado, to focus solely on the Cray-2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. The Cray-2, released in 1985, famously featured a liquid immersion cooling system, resembling an aquarium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.

Surprisingly, the Cray-2 was upstaged by another Cray Research project: the Cray X-MP supercomputer, led by Les Davis and Steve Chen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. Released in 1983, the X-MP introduced **parallel processing** with four CPUs and solid-state storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>. It achieved 2-5 times the speed of the 1S without radical design changes, becoming the world's fastest supercomputer and selling nearly 200 units compared to the Cray-2's 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

### Shifting Landscape and Final Endeavors

The 1980s brought increased competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. Japanese companies like Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC leveraged their semiconductor advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. Additionally, startups like Thinking Machines and nCUBE explored **Massively Parallel Systems (MPPs)**, which coordinated many commercial microprocessors for high performance at a better price point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>.

In 1989, Seymour Cray left [[history_and_evolution_of_the_cray_supercomputer | Cray Research]] entirely to join a spinoff called Cray Computer Corporation (CCC) in Colorado, focusing on his next ambitious project, the Cray-3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. The Cray-3 aimed to use gallium arsenide semiconductors for unprecedented speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>. However, it faced delays and cancellations, especially after the fall of the [[comparison_between_soviet_and_american_computing_advancements | Soviet Union]] reduced defense demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>. CCC sold only one system before filing for bankruptcy in 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>.

Seymour Cray's cherished "clean sheet of paper" approach to building "big iron" supercomputers was no longer financially viable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. He formed SRC Computers to explore parallel designs, but tragically passed away in 1996 at 71 due to a car accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.

Cray Research was eventually acquired by Silicon Graphics and is now part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as Cray Inc. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>. The [[legacy_and_impact_of_the_cray_supercomputer | legacy of the Cray supercomputer]] continues, with modern semiconductor makers facing similar thermal, interconnect, and memory retrieval challenges that Cray ingeniously tackled decades ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.

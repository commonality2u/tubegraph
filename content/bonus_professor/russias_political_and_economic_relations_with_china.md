The relationship between Russia and China, particularly following Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, has been assessed as highly beneficial for China and significantly less so for the Russian Federation, leading to disappointment for President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This dynamic suggests a shift in [[geopolitical_dynamics_involving_china_and_russia | geopolitical dynamics involving China and Russia]] where China appears to hold the dominant position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Economic Outcomes of the Visit

China secured significant economic concessions from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>:
*   **Cheap Gas:** China obtained gas at a substantial discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **New Gas Pipeline:** Russia committed to building a new gas pipeline at its own expense, which will supply gas to China at a "colossal discount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Investment Projects:** Russia gave consent to all Chinese economic requests and investment projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Yuan Settlement:** Russia agreed to pay in Yuan for trade with Latin America and Asia, expanding the Yuan's global appeal and further binding Russia to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This is seen as exclusively beneficial to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

In return, Russia received "beautiful, high-flown, flowery oriental formulas" about being reliable partners resisting attempts to undermine modern peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Military Aid and Strategic Patience

A key point of disappointment for President Putin was China's refusal to promise the supply of lethal military equipment to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Non-Lethal Supplies:** China already supplies non-lethal goods intended for the armed forces and will continue to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Russia's Need:** Russia is in dire need of military equipment to repel an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Putin reportedly motivated this need by stating Russia "cannot lose," implying the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons if the Ukrainian counteroffensive is successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **China's Response:** China responded with "friendly reprimands," vaguely indicating a readiness to revisit the issue of lethal weapons in the summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This delay is attributed to China's desire to observe the results of the Ukrainian counteroffensive before potentially worsening relations with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. China is described as being in "no hurry" while Russia "is spinning like in a frying pan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Power Dynamics and Future Trajectories

The relationship is characterized by China's perceived dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. An anecdote recalls Xi Jinping patting President Putin on the cheek during a meeting in Beijing, a gesture interpreted as a display of power by the dominant party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Vassal State:** Russia is described as turning into a vassal of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, a process that is ongoing but not yet complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **[[Chinese influence on Russian politics | China's Influence on Russian Politics]]:** China's primary concern regarding [[Russian Internal Politics and Economy | Russian internal politics]] is that Russia fulfills its obligations and remains [[russian_political_and_economic_stability | politically stable]], regardless of who holds the presidency (e.g., Putin, Dmitry Patrushev, or Mishustin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Prime Minister Mishustin's participation in an expanded meeting was seen as an audition for Xi Jinping, who was reportedly pleased and invited him to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Xi Jinping's "Mistake":** Xi Jinping is believed to have made a "serious mistake" in February of the previous year by consenting to Putin's assurance of a "lightning-fast and large-scale military operation" in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   **Far East Leases:** A signed agreement from last year, set to take effect in 2025, grants China a 49-year lease on "gigantic territories" in the Russian Far East and Siberia, comparable in area to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. The speaker believes this agreement, deemed "anti-national" for Russia, will not be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.
*   **Future Resistance:** New political forces in Russia, if they come to power, will be directed towards dialogue and interaction with the West, and are expected to have sufficient strength to resist China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. The West, including the United States, Japan, and South Korea, is seen as interested in preventing Russia from merging with China and would assist Russia in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

The Kremlin's approach to international relations is characterized by a strategic use of various tools, a cautious stance towards certain global powers, and a complex network of trusted individuals. President Vladimir Putin's personal traits, including his suspicions and phobias, significantly influence these dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

## Diplomatic Stance and Foreign Leaders

President Putin demonstrates respect for the position of any United States President and harbors a genuine fear of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. During his tenure, classic espionage on US territory has been minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

He also highly respects the Chinese leader due to China's significant economic and political leverage over Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Putin is noted to fulfill the desires of the Chinese leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. Other leaders he respects include Angela Merkel, with whom he can communicate without translators, despite not liking her personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>, and Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who is described as Putin's "alter ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. Putin reportedly aided Erdogan in avoiding a coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

## Strategic Approaches

Putin's primary method in international relations has evolved to [[geopolitical_tensions_and_russias_international_relationships | hybrid warfare]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. This includes cyberattacks against countries like the United States, France, and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. The effectiveness of these methods lies in the ability to deny direct blame, allowing for a "no, no, no, it's not us" narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. This approach has replaced his earlier inclination towards "hot war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics and Influence on Foreign Policy

[[Influence of international relations on Russian politics | Putin's internal political dynamics]] significantly shape his foreign policy. He is described as withdrawn and trusts almost no one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. His most trusted confidantes are Nikolai Platonovich Patrushev and Yuri Kovalchuk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Other figures, such as Igor Sechin, are considered less influential and are used by Putin only when it is convenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. Sergei Kiriyenko is noted for taking responsibility for tasks, which Putin appreciates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>.

Information regarding Putin's health, which was made public, has seriously impacted many processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. The belief within Russia's security apparatus is that guarantees from a "sick dying person" are worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

Putin's fear of his plans being known and manipulated leads to their cancellation or postponement. This includes events like early presidential elections and his message to the Federal Assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

## Relation with Belarus and Ukraine

The Kremlin's relationship with Belarus, specifically Lukashenko, is characterized by a strange dynamic where Lukashenko "twists Putin as he wants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>. Russia is expected to allocate a 3 billion dollar loan to Belarus to support Lukashenko, regardless of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>.

Regarding Ukraine, the Kremlin opted against a large-scale war. In 2014, a recommendation was made to Putin to not accept Yanukovych as a refugee and not to introduce troops into Ukraine, which Putin followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. The decision not to invade Ukraine was based on specific advice at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. The speaker also mentioned that information about the 2014 Kharkiv case (when Yanukovych fled) has been published in their materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:16">[00:45:16]</a>. The speaker indicates they plan to publish more about the Kremlin's policies towards Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:07">[00:45:07]</a>.

## Kremlin's Response to Opposition

The Kremlin considers Alexei Navalny an "enemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. Putin is known to target both "traitors" (those he feels cheated him) and "enemies," even people he has never met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>. The speaker believes that Putin's government is in a precarious position, possibly the worst since 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>.

## Future Revelations

The speaker confirms plans to release more "incriminating materials" regarding oligarchs supporting the Kremlin, including Usmanov and Deripaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>. Usmanov is specifically implicated in drug trafficking in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. There are also plans to publish information about the Polish plane crash that killed the Polish president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>. These revelations are part of a larger strategy to "change the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>.

The question of how long the president of Belarus, [[the_legitimacy_of_leadership_in_ukraine_and_belarus | Alexander Grigorievich Lukashenko]], will remain in power is a prominent topic [00:01:04]. While there is a perception that Lukashenko is supported by Nikolai Patrushev, the speaker notes that Patrushev actually treats Lukashenko with "bad irritation and disbelief" [00:01:17]. This irritation is rooted in past issues involving the late president Putin, spanning more than 20 years [00:01:28].

Despite personal irritation, Patrushev is currently not inclined to quarrel with Lukashenko [00:01:38]. Patrushev is focused on consolidating power on external fronts and seeks to avoid disputes with the few remaining allies [00:01:40]. This highlights a pragmatic approach within [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | political dynamics involving Putin and Lukashenko]] and [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russia's strategy and relations with Belarus]].

## Fate of Lukashenko
The future of Lukashenko, both politically and personally, appears to be intricately linked with internal developments in Russia [00:01:52]. It is suggested that as soon as a radical change in power occurs in [[political_situation_in_russia | Russia]]—meaning a change beyond the preservation of the Putin regime—Lukashenko's tenure at the head of Belarus will be short-lived [00:02:03]. It remains uncertain whether he would have the opportunity to escape to a place like Beijing [00:02:18].

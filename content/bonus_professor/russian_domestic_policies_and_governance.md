Valery Solovey, a doctor of historical sciences, political analyst, and public figure, presents the 11th episode of "What is Happening Today," summarizing the military-political week on Sunday, May 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Military-Political Stance and Diplomatic Efforts

The Kremlin has not been able to achieve a turning point in its favor in the "special military operation," a fact evident to all uncommitted observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The chances of achieving a strategic turning point without using "extremely potent means" are diminishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

Russia faces a dilemma: continue operations with little chance of success or attempt negotiations with Ukraine via the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The Kremlin is sending overt and covert signals to the West regarding its desired negotiation terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. From the Kremlin's perspective, these goals have become almost minimal compared to the initial objectives of the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Kremlin's conditions for a peace treaty include:
*   Complete control of Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   Ukraine's recognition of Crimea as Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   Donbas being independent or potentially part of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   A land corridor to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

An overt attempt at communication was the conversation between Russian Defense Minister Shoigu and US Defense Minister Lai Damaskin, the first since February 18, initiated at Russia's request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

The West's response has been "rather negative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. While France and Germany might favor an agreement on Russia's proposed terms (Macron even suggested territorial concessions to Zelensky, who refused) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, and Germany delays weapon supplies to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>, the "Anglo-Saxon bloc" (Great Britain, USA, Poland, Baltic countries) supports Ukraine fighting "to a victorious end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Ukraine believes it can regain all its territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

The Kremlin and President Putin cannot "leave empty-handed," as this would signify defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The word "capitulation" has appeared in the lexicon of Russian officials for the first time, as stated by the Russian ambassador to Washington, Antonov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. The West does not desire an escalation or territorial expansion of the conflict and has communicated this to Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Domestic Measures and Challenges

With Ukraine preparing for mass mobilization of up to a million people and a counteroffensive aimed at fully reclaiming its territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, Russia reportedly has two main instruments left: mobilization and the use of "qualitatively new weapons," specifically weapons of mass destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

A "hidden mobilization" is underway in the Russian Federation, drawing from the "mog reserve" created in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Public announcement of wider mobilization is expected after President Putin undergoes and recovers from a planned operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Information Control and Propaganda

In the absence of military successes, the Ministry of Defense disseminates "sensational news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The Ministry of Defense, due to current Russian legislation, can only be reported positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Examples include:
*   Allegations by Harry Kirillov, chief of radiation, chemical, and biological protection, about attempts to infect LPR residents with tuberculosis via fake bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Solovey notes the historical parallel to Soviet-era rumors of Americans poisoning chewing gum and cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   Reports on "Pentagon experiments" in a psychiatric hospital in the Kharkov region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   Earlier claims about Ukrainian secret laboratories developing dangerous disease strains and studying migratory bird routes to spread them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

Such news items are seen as diversions, designed to occupy the information space when there are no other positive developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Economic Situation

President Putin held an economic meeting, declaring that Russia is successfully overcoming sanctions, which are seen as an advantage, and that the ruble is the world's best-performing currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. He also stated that the West faces problems like unemployment, inflation, and falling GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Solovey compares this rhetoric to old Soviet jokes about Brezhnev's speeches, where socialism thrives while capitalism collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This "injection of optimism" is seen as a way to "smooth over reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, which is otherwise "absolutely unbearable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

Contrary to official statements, Bloomberg reports that the Ministry of Finance forecasts a GDP decline of 12% in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Under a pessimistic scenario, with continued isolation from world markets and oil sales, the decline could reach 25% over two years, an unprecedented drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Even the 12% decline would be the most significant in 94 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. All economic achievements of the past 10 years are effectively "wasted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. People's incomes have decreased, and prices have risen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Car sales in Russia collapsed by almost 80% in April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. AvtoVAZ is reportedly preparing to offer models from the early 1990s due to the loss of imported components, particularly automotive electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. The threat of unemployment is significant, with one in five companies initiating mass layoffs and another third considering it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

### Societal [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Sociopolitical Dynamics]] and Governance

To compensate for the deteriorating social situation, declining incomes, and lack of economic prospects, the government is resorting to "injections of patriotism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. This includes:
*   Introducing history lessons from the first grade, which is expected to become political information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   Restoring the All-Union Pioneer Organization on May 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

Solovey characterizes the government as "trying to go forward with its head turned back," looking for future examples in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. He notes a direct correlation: the more talk about patriotism and calls for patience, the worse the real state of affairs in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. This "state-owned patriotism" that demands people "live worse" is met with rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

Regarding personnel changes, five governors were removed last week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. Solovey suggests they were "lucky" as the position of governor has become "frankly shot," meaning it carries significant risk and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. High-ranking officials in Russia only resign by order of the supreme leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. Some officials to be removed soon might face imprisonment or criminal cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. The overall [[russian_political_climate_and_leadership | Russian political climate]] is described as "phantasmagoric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

On Friday, February 16, after 7:00 PM, news broke regarding the death of Alexei Navalny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This event led to an emergency broadcast discussing the circumstances surrounding his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

The speaker extended condolences to Navalny's family, friends, and sympathizers, noting his unfortunate inclusion on Russia's list of terrorists and extremists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Navalny was described as a politician with an "amazing quality" and "commitment to the goals and objectives" he set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Natural Death vs. Political Murder

There is a debate whether Navalny's death was natural or a political murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The speaker is inclined towards the latter, suggesting it was a political murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. An international etiological investigation would be needed to convince the speaker otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Even if Navalny's death were natural, the Kremlin has been accused of creating "impossible conditions" for years, including prolonged imprisonment and nearly a year in a punishment cell, specifically intended to critically impact his health and psyche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Indirect Signs of Political Murder

Several indirect signs support the claim of political murder:
*   A "very quick, unanimous reaction" from the Russian official media, who reported the news "on command" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   An "unusually quick reaction" from Peskov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   At least "two or three [[assassination_attempts_on_political_figures_including_trump_and_putin | assassination attempts]]" on significant opponents of the ruling elite group in Russia within the past month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Anticipated Russian Government Narrative

The speaker predicts a flood of "cynical lies and real nonsense" regarding the circumstances of Navalny's death, describing it as "phantasmagoria" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. These anticipated narratives include:
*   Claims that Alexei Navalny is "actually alive and well and is abroad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   Assertions that "the West that sacrificed him" to compromise presidential elections or "blur the effect" of [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | President Putin]]'s interview with Tucker Carlson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   The argument that the murder was "categorically unprofitable for the Kremlin," a common line heard after the murder of Nemtsov, the poisoning of Navalny, and the start of the "Russian military operation against Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

This strategy is termed "blurring" in PR jargon, designed to "distract people's attention from the essence of what is happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## The Logic of the Murder

The speaker argues that Navalny's death *was* profitable and logical for the current elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The individuals involved in his initial poisoning are believed to be the same people who "completed this operation" to remove him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

The primary motive is to "remove any risks, remove any threats" on the eve of the "so-called presidential elections" and, more importantly, the "transfer of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. An elite group aiming for "full power in Russia" wants to eliminate "the slightest risks" by "squeezing out all the grass" and "cementing all the fields" where potential threats might appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

The speaker re-emphasizes that at least "two or three opponents of the regime" faced [[assassination_attempts_on_political_figures_including_trump_and_putin | assassination attempts]] in the preceding month, which were fortunately unsuccessful for the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The death of Navalny is also seen as profitable because it allows the regime to "blame the quiet path," for example, suggesting it was [[assassination_attempt_on_president_putin | Putin]]'s fault, or even claiming responsibility from a body believed to be in a "Valdai refrigerator since October 26" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Call for Transparency and Justice

To counter suspicions, the speaker demands that the authorities invite international, Western, and German experts to conduct a public examination of Navalny's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Crucially, the body should be given to the family for disposal, rather than being managed by the Federal Penitentiary Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Lessons and Future Outlook

*   **Condolences**: The speaker reiterates condolences to Navalny's family, friends, and supporters, highlighting his "colossal political potential" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Love the Living**: A crucial lesson is to "love those who are alive," whether free or imprisoned, providing them with "love and respect and kind words and the main help and support" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Threat to Opposition**: The speaker warns that [[political_implications_of_navalnys_death | Navalny's death]] is "only the beginning," and "Russian oppositionists are under threat," both inside and outside the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **A Tragic Year**: The year 2024 is predicted to be "tragic" and "much harder" than previous years, potentially "the hardest year in our entire life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Survival Advice**: In these difficult times, it is important to "take care of health," "help your family and friends" as they are "the key to our stability and the key and conditions for our survival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Hope for Change**: Despite the grim predictions, the speaker conveys "confidence" and "hope," firmly believing that "everything will change for the better and will begin to change already in this 2024" and that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

The world is currently undergoing a significant transition, a process that began in the 1990s with the collapse of the Soviet model of socialism [00:50:50]. This transition is affecting global dynamics, and within this context, the [[Russian political elite and Putin | Russian political elite]] faces unique challenges and interactions with Western organizations.

## Nature of Western Elite Organizations

There is a [[International relations and the involvement of Russian figures | global financial elite]] that remains a dominant group, though its circles are largely hermetic and not inclined to expansion [00:10:51]. They prefer to maintain their status quo through a degree of closure, especially noticeable among Anglo-Saxon and, to a lesser extent, European elites [00:11:07].

There are various non-public, influential organizations, sometimes mistakenly called "secret societies" [00:11:25]. Approximately a dozen and a half such organizations exist globally [00:11:38]. These are not mere negotiating platforms like the Bildberg Club [00:11:40] but influential "order-type" organizations [00:13:22]. Unlike Masons, whose peak influence is long past [00:13:07], these organizations are much more powerful [00:13:25]. Their composition includes the "cream" of Western society [00:13:34].

These organizations are not a "world government" â€“ the speaker believes such a thing does not exist due to the impossibility of organization and the concept of free will [00:49:36]. Their goals often extend beyond wealth acquisition to the transformation of human nature [00:12:40]. They are often very old organizations [00:12:59] and hold a characteristic sense of historical responsibility for their nation and mission [00:15:01].

## Russian Elites' Desire for Access and Rejection

The "cream" of [[Russian political elite and Putin | Russian society]], those who believe they have "grabbed God by the beard," are "terribly irritated" that they are not accepted into these influential Western circles [00:13:38]. They intensely desire to join these closed clubs [00:14:11].

Reasons for their non-acceptance include:
*   **Lack of Status and Mission:** Western elites question the identity and status of [[Russian political elite and Putin | Russian elites]], asking, "Who are you?" given their shifting political identities (from communists to "pure Denikin and Kolchak") [00:14:24]. They also question, "Why do we need you?" [00:14:47].
*   **Perceived as "Thieves":** A key issue is the perception of many [[Russian political elite and Putin | Russian elites]] as thieves [00:15:15]. An incident is cited where a very rich [[Russian political elite and Putin | Russian figure]] trying to establish contacts with Americans was told, "You are a thief, we have no dialogue with you" [00:15:19]. This perception is not tied to ethnicity [00:15:25].
*   **Lack of Historical Responsibility:** [[Russian political elite and Putin | Russian counterparts]] lack the historical responsibility that characterizes members of these Western organizations [00:15:07].
*   **Deep Distrust:** Western elites deeply despise and distrust [[Russian political elite and Putin | Russian security officers]], viewing them as agents of an unclear motive and loyalty [00:17:09]. This distrust creates serious problems for professional activities of [[russian_military_operations_and_international_relations | Russian special services]], who once had negotiating platforms (like in Vienna) that are now closing [00:17:19].

## Motivations and Fears of the Russian Elite

The core motivation of many [[Russian political elite and Putin | Russian elites]] is money and power [00:18:08]. A common perception among Western counterparts is that [[Russian political elite and Putin | Russian figures]] are primarily driven by "bribes and money" [00:18:13]. This is considered "fair" for 99.9% of them [00:18:21]. However, some individuals within the [[Russian political elite and Putin | elite]] do aspire to "leave a mark in history" and a "good memory" [00:18:41]. Yet, they are constrained by the impossibility of building alternative projects or acting against the will of the presidential administration without risking "complete catastrophe" [00:19:10].

There is a significant mass of middle-class bureaucracy (heads of departments, deputy heads) who desire change and reform projects but are unwilling to risk their positions [00:21:29].

### Internal Power Struggles and Occultism
Within the [[Russian political elite and Putin | ruling elite]], there is a "fierce fight of bulldogs under the carpet," competing for [[Russian political elite and Putin | Putin's power]] [00:22:29]. Key figures include:
*   Kovalchuk [00:22:42]
*   Timchenko [00:22:45]
*   Igor Ivanovich [00:22:45]
*   Patrushev [00:22:47]
*   Dmitry Medvedev [00:22:52]
*   Sergey Shoigu [00:22:55]
*   Sergey Sobyanin (who lost influence temporarily but found new allies) [00:23:03]

These figures engage in "typical intrigues" and sometimes resort to "occult means" [00:23:51]. Some turn to Siberian shamans, while others invite shamans from Latin America [00:23:58]. The settlement of major political events can be accompanied by "shamanic journeys" [00:24:14]. Different departments or groups prefer different "occult styles" [00:24:24]. Practices like animal sacrifice (black rooster, black goat with heart extraction) are "quite popular now in Moscow in narrow circles" [00:24:40]. The demand for such practices has sharply increased since 2014, as elites feel the ground shifting and seek "any available tools" to preserve their assets and positions [00:25:13]. They also view Orthodoxy "as a kind of magicians" [00:25:35].

When consulting with these "miracle workers" or "forces of darkness," [[Russian political elite and Putin | Russian elites]] have never sought "knowledge of the truth" or "penetration into secrets" [00:27:06]. Before 2020, their primary interest was how to "increase your fortune and strengthen your positions of power" [00:27:24]. In 2020, the focus shifted to "how to save" their assets [00:27:35]. This indicates a lack of "personal inner meaning" [00:27:49].

### Insecurity and Control
The [[Russian political elite and Putin | Russian authorities]] are characterized by deep insecurity about their legitimacy [00:32:04]. This self-doubt leads them to seek "real rulers of this world" and to resort to "brutal tone" and repression to instill confidence in their own strength [00:52:09]. They are "very afraid of change" and of the situation getting "out of control" [00:52:48]. They are also afraid of the West, particularly when their attempts to corrupt Western institutions fail and values or incorruptible organizations emerge [00:52:55].

### Asset Transfer
In the last two years, [[Russian political elite and Putin | Russian elites]] have begun transferring assets from digital to physical forms, purchasing real estate, and storing "tons and tons of dollars" and "tens of tons of gold" abroad [00:54:14]. They prefer physical assets because they need to "see it, to feel, to stroke these pallets, these containers" [00:55:08]. This shift to physical storage, often in places like Africa and Latin America (which play a similar role to 1940s Nazism's escape routes) [00:55:57], is driven by the fear that American intelligence might access their digital assets [00:55:48].

## "World Government" Perception

Despite evidence to the contrary, about half the [[Russian societal concerns and priorities | Russian population]], including all [[Russian political elite and Putin | Russian elites]], believe in the existence of a "world government" [00:50:49]. This belief creates a significant problem: if the [[Russian political elite and Putin | political elite]]'s policies were based on national public interests, the existence of such organizations wouldn't matter [00:51:00]. However, their insecurity about their own legitimacy leads them to search for these "real rulers of this world" [00:51:30].

## Challenges and Future Outlook

The current [[Russian political climate | Russian political system]] lacks a meaning of development and is characterized by mutually competing groups [00:43:15]. Its stability is "incredibly fragile" [00:43:50] and depends on external influences [00:43:54].

The speaker highlights the growing request for change within [[Russian societal concerns and priorities | Russian society]], shared by more than two-thirds, possibly three-quarters, of society, a level not seen since 1990-1999 [00:32:51]. This includes a "colossal request for freedom" [00:33:15]. While there are no clearly expressed political subjects of change [00:33:21], the "readiness" of the populace for revolt against the modern world is "very high" [00:35:15].

Triggers for change could be:
*   **Economic Collapse:** A rapid, significant devaluation of the ruble (e.g., another 30-40% in a week) followed by a denomination and exchange of banknotes could cause a "very strong mass reaction" [00:36:13].
*   **Political Transit:** The beginning of the [[Russian political analysis | process of transit]] of power, where competing internal factions realize one is losing and turn to society for support [00:40:11]. This could lead to an unpredictable game [00:40:29].

The current [[Russian political elite and Putin | supreme power]] is not ready for war, unlike in 2014 [00:39:32], due to [[Russian political elite and Putin | Putin's]] perceived lethargy [00:39:41]. Experts suggest that the Turkish army, for instance, is one of the best, making conflict extremely dangerous [00:39:54].

While external pressure and sanctions are employed by non-public organizations [00:48:09], the ultimate fate of the country will be decided by the "peoples of [[Russian nationalism and political tensions | Russia]]" [00:47:05]. These organizations respect the principle of free will and the "limitations of any manipulative mechanism" [00:47:07]. The speaker emphasizes that "the society will decide all the same" [00:48:05].

The current [[Russian political climate | authorities]] are trying to legitimate their power by referencing contradictory historical figures like Stalin, Nicholas II, Kolchak, Denikin, and Mannerheim [00:28:00]. However, Lenin is seen as deeply antipathetic because he personifies the "destruction of the status quo" and the "destruction of the old order" [00:29:17].

Ultimately, due to a lack of meaningful historical narratives from the authorities, "only an increase in terror is possible, only an increase in dictatorship" [00:30:12]. However, the authorities are perceived to have reached the limit of their repressive capabilities, and repression will not solve problems like economic growth or transit of power [00:30:40]. The system's own decreasing efficiency due to internal conflicts (e.g., arresting governors leads to paralysis) is a significant factor [00:32:11].

The speaker concludes that the end of the current year and the next year are expected to be "surprisingly eventful" [00:40:42]. For individuals, the advice is to "do what we can," guided by conscience, civic feeling, and responsibility to the people and homeland [00:57:07].

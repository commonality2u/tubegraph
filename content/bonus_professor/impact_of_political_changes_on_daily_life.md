From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Valery Solovey recorded a special edition of his program "What's Happening" on April 12, expressing a sad feeling that the situation would develop "more alarmingly, faster, fleeting, and worse" than previously expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. He indicated that while not certain, there is a very high probability of facing martial law on a general national scale, meaning throughout [[social_and_political_changes_in_russia | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Impending Societal Changes

In such a scenario, legal discussions and contradictions with amendments to legislation adopted on April 11 would become irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Solovey believes that the law itself would lose meaning, allowing authorities to do "whatever they want" with citizens' lives, property, and modest savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

He stated that on April 11, the process of introducing "military serfdom in [[social_and_political_changes_in_russia | Russia]] in the literal sense of the word began," describing it as a "monstrous social regression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This process of enslavement of the [[social_and_political_changes_in_russia | Russian]] population is expected to be successfully completed with the introduction of martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that the next few months will bring changes no less large-scale and qualitative than those seen starting February 24, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. He warns that the coming year will require everyone to live in a state of "severe constant permanent stress," where life, property, and savings face not just constant but a "growing threat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Practical Impacts on Daily Life

### Mobilization and Enforcement

*   **Border Closures and Databases**: For months, Solovey has warned about borders being prepared for closure and the formation of databases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Mobilization Evasion**: Despite the ongoing "partial mobilization" since September of last year, no one has been subjected to criminal or administrative prosecution for evading it or failing to report to the military enlistment office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. The speaker suggests that even with martial law, the risks of such prosecution will likely remain minimal, with any punishments being demonstrative rather than widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
*   **Summons and Comb-outs**: While the single register of military personnel for summonses isn't ready until autumn, existing integrated databases are sufficient to issue summonses and "comb the public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
*   **Shortened Response Time**: The law adopted on April 11, which suggests 20 days for a summons response, is considered a "lie"; there will be no 20 days, and actions will be immediate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **Automatic Blocking of Assets**: Bank accounts and cards are expected to be blocked automatically, though this is not explicitly stated in the law. This measure is highlighted in documents presented to the president as the "most important, most effective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
*   **Civil Rights Restrictions**: Drivers' licenses will be canceled, and civil rights, including travel abroad and property rights, will be restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Direct to Assembly Point**: Once apprehended, individuals taken to military enlistment offices will likely be sent directly to assembly points and then "into the fields" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Self-Sufficiency for Mobilized Personnel**: Families may be expected to supply equipment, bulletproof vests, and other provisions for mobilized personnel, as part of a shift towards self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

### Preserving Life, Health, and Property

The speaker outlines two main priorities for survival in the face of these [[social_and_political_changes_in_russia | changes]]:
1.  **Preserving one's own life and health, and that of family and friends** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
2.  **Preserving modest property, savings, and businesses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

It is warned that getting through this period without losses is impossible for individuals or families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Losses, including money, nerves, lives, injuries, and illnesses, are inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Everything outside these two priorities (e.g., apartment repairs, new purchases, vacations) should be considered secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, and some secondary tasks may need to be forgotten or ignored due to limited time and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### Advice for Navigating the Crisis

*   **Avoid Risky Situations**: Avoid places and situations that increase personal risks, such as those where authorities might "comb the public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Financial Security**:
    *   Withdraw money and transfer it to trusted relatives or friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
    *   Always have a sufficient amount of cash for operational freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
*   **Vehicle Ownership**: A general power of attorney will not protect a car; it will still be considered one's property and subject to impoundment, requiring payment for its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   **Business Protection**: It is difficult to protect a business, and in some cases, rewriting ownership may not be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. Legal recommendations are highly advised to develop schemes for property and business preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.
*   **Legal Counsel**: Always have a lawyer's phone number readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

### Emotional and Psychological Well-being

*   **Community and Support**: It will be "impossible or extremely difficult" to survive the coming stress alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Support from others is crucial; sharing fears and concerns, and having close people to express emotions, helps reduce stress levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Role of Women**: Women are seen as having a primary role in building emotional balance and mental stability for families, as men tend to fall into prostration or panic more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Stress Relief Techniques**:
    *   Moderate alcohol consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
    *   Sedatives for acute reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   Sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
    *   Sports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
    *   Walks in fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
    *   Pets and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Calmness**: The most important advice is "calmness," or at least the absence of hysteria and panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   **Safe Haven**: A safe haven is needed, along with reliable friends or an extensive family that can provide assistance, and a "spare person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

The speaker describes the current period as a "holiday of common misfortune" or a "funeral feast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. The goal is to navigate this period with the "least losses," preserving life and health, even if it means losing some money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. He concludes by stating that the "time of great [[change_in_the_political_landscape_in_russia | changes]] has come," which are fraught with "great troubles" and will come at a high price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.

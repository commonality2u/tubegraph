The Russian leadership has made a fundamental decision regarding the [[freezing_of_bank_deposits | freezing of bank deposits and accounts]], with a 100% consensus among them that such a measure is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33">[16:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45">[16:45]</a>. This decision comes amidst forecasts indicating a rapidly deteriorating [[economic_conditions_in_Russia | economic]] and social situation, potentially leading to a [[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_Russia | socio-economic catastrophe]] comparable to the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51">[15:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10">[16:10]</a>.

## Timing of the Freeze

While the decision to freeze deposits is firm, two key questions remain open: when and under what specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51">[16:51]</a>.

The initial thought for implementation was around the turn of spring and summer, or even earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05">[17:05]</a>. The summer period is considered because people are typically less aggressive then and may find it easier to endure such shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21">[17:21]</a>. However, the exact timing will depend on the context; if the situation deteriorates too quickly, authorities will not wait for the summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14">[17:14]</a>. It is not excluded that the freeze could occur as early as spring, perhaps around February or March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55">[17:55]</a>.

## Conditions of the Freeze

Regarding the conditions of the [[potential_economic_crisis_and_freeze_on_deposits_and_accounts | freeze on deposits and accounts]], there is currently no full clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:42">[18:42]</a>. Two potential options have been discussed:

1.  **More Humane Option**: This approach would involve leaving an "insurance amount" available, such as 1,400,000 rubles, with only amounts exceeding this sum being frozen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44">[18:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01">[19:01]</a>. This is described as a "very soft, vegetarian option" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:10">[19:10]</a>.
2.  **Strict Option**: A more extreme measure would be to freeze everything exceeding even 20,000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14">[19:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17">[19:17]</a>. This would also involve introducing strict limits on cash withdrawals and non-cash settlements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23">[19:23]</a>.

## Warnings and Advice

Ahead of these potential measures, the public was advised to purchase currency, specifically Euros and Dollars, to protect savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40">[14:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42">[14:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50">[14:50]</a>. This advice was given in anticipation of the ruble's fall, which saw the dollar rise to 115-118 rubles, closely matching previous forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01">[14:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06">[14:06]</a>. While there is a temporary partial stabilization of the ruble, with the exchange rate rising against the dollar to 105 rubles, this is expected to be temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14">[15:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20">[15:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29">[15:29]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Future forecasts from the Russian leadership, including the financial and monetary authorities and Politburo 2.0, are unambiguous: the [[economic_conditions_in_Russia | economic]] and social situation will continue to worsen rapidly, heading towards a [[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_Russia | socio-economic catastrophe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32">[15:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46">[15:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:51">[15:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05">[16:05]</a>. The government's preparations for this crisis are likely to be at the expense of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20">[16:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31">[16:31]</a>.

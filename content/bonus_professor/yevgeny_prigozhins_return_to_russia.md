The program for June 3, 2024, included a discussion of the [[potential_return_of_prigozhin_and_speculation_on_putins_death | return to Russia of Yevgeny Prigozhin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. While considered one of the main topics, it was also described as "absolutely secondary, even tertiary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> compared to the primary ongoing development: the construction of a new [[political_transition_in_russia | configuration of power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Prigozhin's Symbolic and Anticipated Return

Yevgeny Prigozhin's "return" to Russia has been noted by the appearance of a full-length bronze monument erected in his honor in St. Petersburg, at the Porokhovskoye cemetery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. The speaker facetiously remarks that Prigozhin has "returned so far in this capacity to Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>, referring to the monument on his "so-called grave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>, as he is reportedly not buried there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

Despite this symbolic return, it is asserted that Prigozhin "will definitely return" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a> to Russia in a literal sense, even going to "his own grave to admire the monument" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

## The Grotesque Nature of Russian Politics

The situation surrounding Prigozhin's status and perceived return is described as "grotesque" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>, an "infernal or perhaps... macabre humor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a> that is characteristic of [[russian_political_dynamics_and_putins_public_appearances | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. The speaker suggests that for anyone trying to understand [[political_changes_in_russia_post_putin | Russian politics]], the motto should be "don't be surprised by anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>, as "the most unexpected and the most unforeseen will happen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

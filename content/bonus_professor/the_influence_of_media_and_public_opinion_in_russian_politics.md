This article addresses questions regarding political crises, power dynamics, economic forecasts, and the role of information and media in shaping public perception in Russia.

## Political Crisis and Power Dynamics
Predicting the development, content, and results of a political crisis is deemed impossible by existing theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a>. However, anticipating the *entry* into a political crisis is possible, with an accuracy exceeding 75% and approaching that of a short-term weather forecast (85%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:23">[01:53:23]</a>. While the course and final results of a crisis cannot be predicted, active participation from the outset can influence desirable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:05">[02:23:05]</a>. The most acute phase, or "peak," of a crisis is expected to last only a few days, but the crisis itself will extend for several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>.

In the ongoing power struggles within Russia, influential figures like Nikolai Patrushev face opposition from equally influential individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:04">[02:59:04]</a>. The pursuit of power often blinds rational sense, making agreements difficult due to distrust among supposed allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:08">[03:11:08]</a>. For instance, Kostin of VTB, despite some perceptions, gravitates towards Chemezov's coalition, which is currently seen as potentially stronger than Patrushev's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:41">[04:32:41]</a>.

### Role of State Organs During Crisis
The Prosecutor General's Office and Investigative Committee are expected to align with the winning side in an upcoming crisis, acting as instruments for powerful coalitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:04">[05:06:04]</a>. However, in the acute phase, they may play no direct role due to a lack of armed resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:02">[05:15:02]</a>. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is anticipated to adopt a position of neutrality, likened to a "fortress plan," where they close off and avoid involvement, similar to the KGB in August 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:31">[05:47:31]</a>. The Ministry of Defense is also expected to remain neutral, though the General Staff's main department could play a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:01">[06:26:01]</a>.

## Economic and Social Implications of Change
Following a change in power, significant reforms are anticipated:
*   Those who committed crimes, such as beating protesters or delivering unlawful sentences, will face prosecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:02">[07:30:02]</a>.
*   All court employees will undergo lustration without exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:34">[07:45:34]</a>.
*   The minimum wage is planned to increase at least two to three times through internal resource redistribution, budget rationalization, and a reduction in corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:04">[08:19:04]</a>.
*   Housing prices and mortgage costs are expected to decrease significantly due to increased efficiency and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:33">[08:48:33]</a>.
*   The ruble faces an unfavorable prospect, suggesting that stocking up on dollars or Euros remains a sensible decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:04">[09:10:04]</a>.
*   The previous retirement age is aimed to be reinstated within one to one and a half years, with compensation provided to those who retired under different conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:44:03">[27:44:03]</a>.
*   Individuals in difficult social circumstances, particularly retirees, will receive vital drugs for free or with significant discounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:34:04">[28:34:04]</a>.
*   The authorities' fear of an armed populace is cited as a reason for tightening weapons legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:04">[29:16:04]</a>. Ultimately, the right to bear arms may be introduced in Russia after a period of societal recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:30:04">[29:30:04]</a>.
*   The problem of personal data leaks from government agencies is acknowledged, and the new government plans to stop this "Homeric fraud" within months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:56:04">[34:56:04]</a>.

## [[Perceptions and narratives in Russian media | Media and Public Perception]]
### Satire and Information Dissemination
The revival of the satirical program "New Dolls" (Novye Kukly) on YouTube and Telegram is viewed as a very successful attempt at satirically depicting Russian reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:01">[09:25:01]</a>. This program, approved by the author of the original "Dolls," Shenderovich, maintains a high standard and offers a witty distraction from current events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:08">[09:48:08]</a>.

Despite talk of bans, cryptocurrency and crypto exchanges are unlikely to be banned in Russia, as the country is in dire need of their use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:02">[10:56:02]</a>.
Concerns about potential financial crises include discussions of freezing deposits and tightening limits on cash withdrawals, an idea reportedly ready for implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19:07">[11:19:07]</a>.

### Corruption and Public Awareness
The ongoing completion of the Gelendzhik palace, highlighted in a film by Navalny's team, is presented not as a residence but as a "gigantic theft of budgets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:01">[12:46:01]</a>. Its purpose is to facilitate theft, and who lives there is irrelevant, as it can be destroyed and rebuilt again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:37">[13:07:37]</a>.

### [[Media Manipulation and Lies in Russian Politics | Media and Agents of Influence]]
There are many agents of Russian special services within the opposition media environment of the Russian Federation, whose identities would shock the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:36:03">[20:36:03]</a>. This suggests a significant level of infiltration and manipulation within information channels.

The speaker notes that other bloggers do not "furiously" claim Putin's death because they may lack confidence, are afraid, or because such an admission would destroy their established "coordinate system" of fighting against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>. Peskov, despite his public role, holds insignificant influence and is not on any team, yet he, like the rest of the Russian elite, is aware of Putin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>.

### Societal Attitudes and [[Public Opinion and Political Shifts in Russia | State Indifference]]
The Russian authorities are depicted as indifferent to the problems of PTSD in the population, viewing such issues as problems of society, not their concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:05:00">[34:05:00]</a>. This highlights a fundamental disconnect, where the state and authorities do not care about the populace, seeing them merely as a "working code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:28:03">[34:28:03]</a>.

## Foreign Policy and Regional Outlook
*   The Russian Federation currently lacks the strength to take the city of Kharkov, and it is unlikely to acquire such forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:07">[13:42:07]</a>. However, a collapse of the Ukrainian front due to the "fog of war" cannot be ruled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:03">[13:49:03]</a>.
*   Peaceful negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are possible both before and after a potential coup in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:01">[14:46:01]</a>.
*   The political force represented in the discussion unequivocally supports investigating war crimes and punishing those guilty of crimes against humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:08">[15:13:08]</a>.
*   Zelensky is believed to have been informed about Putin's death by Ukrainian intelligence, which receives information from Western intelligence detachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.
*   The possibility of a nuclear war is theoretically not excluded, but practically, despite rhetoric, the real chance is very small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>.
*   The Kaliningrad region will be fine unless Russia initiates a hybrid operation against the Baltic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:08">[21:30:08]</a>.
*   Crimea is expected to face negative developments regardless of how the situation unfolds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>.
*   The hypothetical possibility of Siberia and the Far East falling under China's protectorate is considered low, depending on Russia's future leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:07">[22:03:07]</a>.
*   The Kremlin's plans for Georgia have largely been implemented, with the Georgian leadership under strong Kremlin influence, evidenced by the adoption of the "Foreign Agency" law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:53:08">[29:53:08]</a>. However, the Kremlin cannot influence Georgian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:21:05">[30:21:05]</a>.
*   The Kremlin desires to punish Armenia due to Nikol Pashinyan's leadership but lacks the resources, which are diverted to other fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:28:00">[30:28:00]</a>.

### Societal Risks and Future Outlook
*   The probability of terrorist acts committed by Islamic extremists is being actively countered by security officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:04">[22:32:04]</a>.
*   The "Sirius Sochi" project, an educational complex, is genuinely functioning to encourage gifted children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:07:05">[23:07:05]</a>.
*   The Russian government's potential pandemic agreement with the WHO is deemed insignificant, as the WHO's influence is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:08">[23:40:08]</a>.
*   Membership in the WTO is viewed calmly, as it neither significantly harms nor helps Russia, and no country has left the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:04">[24:16:04]</a>.
*   A hybrid operation against the Baltic countries, specifically Latvia and Estonia, is preliminarily scheduled for summer-fall 2024, although the preparatory stage has not yet begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:12:08">[25:12:08]</a>.
*   The law banning "agents" from participating in elections is met with sarcasm, seen as a self-limiting measure by the current authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:10:04">[26:10:04]</a>.
*   An elite war in Russia will not escalate into a civil war or lead to the collapse of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:11:04">[36:11:04]</a>. While armed excesses are probable, they will be localized, likely in Moscow, and may even avoid the actual use of weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:20:00">[36:20:00]</a>. A large-scale civil war is not foreseen due to a lack of necessary conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:41:00">[36:41:00]</a>. A risk of a split or withdrawal of some territories exists, particularly in the North Caucasus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:55:00">[36:55:00]</a>.
*   Prigozhin is expected to "get in touch" and reappear in the Russian Federation at a time he deems most favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:11:00">[37:11:00]</a>.
*   Confidence in the speaker's team coming to power is based on knowledge of the specific situation and power balance in society, along with unrevealed "other things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:51:00">[37:51:00]</a>.
*   Stalin was not actively killed but was not prevented from dying by being denied timely medical care, as depicted in "The Death of Stalin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:26:00">[38:26:00]</a>.
*   The speaker personally believes a limited monarchy, with a new dynasty as a symbol of unity and guardians of law and order, could be considered in the very distant future (15-20 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:58:00">[38:58:00]</a>.
*   Mr. Chemezov theoretically could become president but, like Patrushev Sr., prefers to influence Russia from behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:35:00">[39:35:00]</a>.
*   Social networks like YouTube, Telegram, and WhatsApp will not be closed, as previous exercises were unsuccessful, and the idea has been shelved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:59:00">[39:59:00]</a>.

The [[role_and_perception_of_russian_leadership_and_power_structures | Russian leadership]] and its power structures, particularly the security services, play a significant role in political decisions, internal dynamics, and economic controls.

## Influence on Political Actions and Personnel

A recent dialogue on YouTube, where a [[role_and_influence_of_putins_doubles | Putin]] "double" reprimanded Manturov for mishandling waste incineration plant funds, was initiated by the [[role_and_influence_of_patrushev_and_chemezov | Patrushev group]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. This [[role_and_influence_of_patrushev_and_chemezov | Patrushev group]] reportedly enjoys a good relationship with the Presidential Security Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:02">[03:00:02]</a>, which also supervises the [[role_and_influence_of_putins_doubles | double of President Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:44">[03:07:44]</a>.

### Specific Prevented Actions

The [[role_and_influence_of_patrushev_and_chemezov | Chemezov group]], a significant faction, is credited with preventing a new wave of mobilization and the use of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. The speaker suggests that many "extremely dangerous things" were averted due to the actions of certain individuals and groups behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. For instance, the use of tactical nuclear weapons became a practical issue around March-April 2022, but was blocked by "several brave, courageous people" at the cost of their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics and Power Struggles

The speaker highlights the visible manifestation of the struggle of elite coalitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. The "power or the Chekist" tower within the Kremlin seeks to end military actions with Ukraine on more militant conditions compared to the "pragmatist and realists" tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

Kadyrov's public behavior also indicates internal dynamics, showing "not very good relations" with Russian security forces like Bastrykin and Kolokoltsev, with the exception of Zolotov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:58:00">[27:58:00]</a>. Conversely, Kadyrov has an "excellent relationship" with Mishustin, who reportedly provides Chechnya with everything it needs and "even a little more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>.

## Financial Control and Surveillance

The speaker notes that fraudulent schemes are protected by known individuals, and experts from "these very bodies" (implying security services) believe that mass telephone scams could be stopped within six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:01:00">[45:01:00]</a>. Furthermore, all cryptocurrency exchanges ("crypto-beings") are stated to be under the auspices and control of the [[general_svr_and_its_significance_in_russian_politics | FSB]], with all transactions being recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:28:00">[48:28:00]</a>. While small transactions (under $20-$50) may not attract significant attention, larger transfers of millions of dollars are noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:43:00">[48:43:00]</a>. The [[role_and_perception_of_russian_leadership_and_power_structures | Russian authorities]] widely use cryptocurrency as one of the few remaining tools to circumvent sanctions, and thus are not preparing to arrest or confiscate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:11:00">[48:11:00]</a>.

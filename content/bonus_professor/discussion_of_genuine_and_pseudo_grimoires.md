Andrey Kosmach, a specialist in [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | occultism]] and magical practices, discusses the nature of grimoires, distinguishing between authentic and falsified versions, and their role in modern society, particularly among the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>.

## The Origin of "Black Magic" and Pseudo Grimoires

The concept of "black magic" and its associated works, including grimoires, are presented as lacking historical roots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. Instead, "black magic" is described as a "creative creation of the hands of the Holy Roman Inquisition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:55">[00:37:55]</a>.

Many known works classified as black magic have no connection to metaphysics or rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. These "pseudo works" are considered figments of the imagination of Inquisition monks from the late Middle Ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>. Original historical manuscripts were destroyed or barbarically altered, with texts erased and new ones written in their place, distorting the original meaning beyond recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.

The purpose of these distortions was to replace authentic texts that described genuine ways to alter consciousness, space-time, and reality, which are the domain of [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | occultism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>. These "banal remakes" were compiled within the Christian mythological tradition, creating a "fictitious enemy" that the Christian ideological doctrine could consistently "support victory over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>.

## Genuine Grimoires

Genuine grimoires are compiled and used by only "13 great [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | occult]] orders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. They are considered completely inaccessible to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>.

Key characteristics of genuine grimoires include:
*   **Source Material**: They are based on a few ancient ritual texts, such as the Minoan tract, manuscripts and collections of the Medici family, and other independent sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. The earliest known version of the Minoan treatise dates back to late antiquity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>.
*   **Structure**: A genuine grimoire is a complex ritual structure, not a single independent unit, described as "a book in a book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a>. Performing a single ritual may require using parts from two seemingly different grimoires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.
*   **Content**: Genuine grimoires do not mention the devil or demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.
*   **Occult Principle**: In genuine [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | occultism]], nothing is taken on faith; any ritual action must be experimentally confirmed and repeatable with the same result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. Research in the 1970s found that 97% of rituals are empty and ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.

## Pseudo Grimoires and Their Popularity in Russia

Modern grimoires, often purchased at auctions for "gigantic ideas" by buyers from Russia, are described as skillfully concocted fakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. These pseudo works are often "oversaturated with dream fate and ceremonial theatricality," a criterion that makes them popular among the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a>. Examples include a grimoire mentioning 48 demons and the "About to Power" grimoire popular among Kremlin officials, which lists 32 demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:28">[00:44:28]</a>.

They are considered useless and potentially harmful, bringing the exact opposite results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:35">[00:48:35]</a>. The "pseudo-elite" in Russia resorts to "atavistic overboard" pseudo-cults, which are completely inauthentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>. They use an eclectic mix of pseudo-grimoires, including those described by Alphonse Louis Constant (Eliphas Lévi), which are deemed "rubbish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:53">[00:49:53]</a>.

### Influence in Russian Elite

There is a growing interest in "black magic" among society and the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>. The government's actions create a trend, leading other members of society to actively integrate into it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.

The use of these pseudo grimoires by the authorities is seen as a "placebo effect" that calms them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. It's considered a form of "self-deception and group psychotherapy" where they convince themselves they have the support of higher powers, seeking a "ring of omnipotence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. This contributes to the [[influence_of_occult_beliefs_on_decision_making | influence of occult beliefs on decision making]] and [[mystical_beliefs_among_russian_elite | mystical beliefs among Russian elite]] within the [[occult_practices_in_russian_politics | Russian government]].

One high-ranking Russian official revealed his personal motive for engaging in such rituals was "Satanism for me as a tool justification of the present and the prospect of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>. He compares visiting these sites to attending a CPSU party meeting—something one *must* do because "everyone does it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. This trend has been prominent in Russia for two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:43">[00:51:43]</a>.

## The Cup of the Blind King

The "Cup of the Blind King" is identified as a genuinely authentic ritual from the collection of Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.

### Ritual Description
The ritual involves a golden cup filled with "anthropomorphic" (human) blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:18]</a>. The cup is placed on a hot surface over an open fire and then cut in half, spilling its contents onto the hot surface to initiate a "violent reaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:55">[01:09:55]</a>. From the two halves of the cup, a "golden seal of death" is cast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>.

Additionally, 33 spells, written on leather scrolls and sealed, are burned on the same surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>. The resulting ash is preserved and used to create the "seal of death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>.

### Consequences and Performance
The implementation of this ritual is associated with undermining mental health, causing "mental epidemics," and leading to induced disorders and the destruction of identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.

This basic ritual was performed on December 14, 2020, during a solar eclipse, in the Rio Negro province of Argentina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>. Two related variation rituals were also performed in Nepal and Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>.

The ritual's complexity lies in its fundamental immutability and stability, yet it allows for innovations that complicate its structure. To level out its consequences or perform anthropomorphism, one must know both the basic part and the allowed innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:50">[01:12:50]</a>. Attempting counter-rites without this precise knowledge will only strengthen the original ritual, similar to an antidote requiring exact knowledge of the poison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.

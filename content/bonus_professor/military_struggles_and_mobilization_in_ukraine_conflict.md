## Program Introduction
This article summarizes the 25th episode of the program "What's Happening" by Valery Soloviev, recorded on Sunday, September 18, and released on Monday, September 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The previous 24th episode was temporarily withdrawn for technical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

The 25th episode covers several key topics:
*   A "failure" (Samarkand summit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   The role of penal battalions in avoiding defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>
*   Chekists against the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   The assassination attempt on President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
*   Russia moving "from bad to worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

## Russia's "Failure" at the Samarkand Summit
The Samarkand summit in Uzbekistan is described as a "failure" for Russia and President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This failure is analyzed across four aspects:

### Image and Symbolic Failure
*   **Protocol Issues:** Putin was met only by the Prime Minister of Uzbekistan, while the President of Uzbekistan met other leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Previously, others would wait for Putin, including the late Queen of England and the Pope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This time, Putin had to wait for four state leaders: India, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Kyrgyzstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Perceived Status:** A notable photograph from the summit shows Turkish President Erdogan in a central chair, with Azerbaijan's Aliyev next to him, and Putin sitting on a sofa between the presidents of Belarus and Tajikistan, indicating a diminished status for Russia's president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Interactions with Leaders:**
    *   The Prime Minister of India spoke to Putin in a didactic tone, stating that "wars are not what should be done in the 21st century," to which Putin made excuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
    *   When asked about [[military_and_political_situation_in_ukraine | Ukraine]], Putin offered a "cheerful" but unconvincing answer that "everything is going according to plan," leading Chinese President Xi Jinping to smile ironically and shake his head with "obvious distrust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Geopolitical Failure
The summit highlighted that China and Turkey are becoming the true powers, successfully developing influence in the post-Soviet space traditionally considered Russia's domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **China's Guarantees:** Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly stated in Astana (Kazakhstan's capital) that China guarantees the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Kazakhstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The President of Kazakhstan, by the way, demonstratively avoided communicating with Putin at the summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Central Asian Conflicts:** The conflict between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan initially did not turn to Moscow for mediation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Putin later offered his services himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. These countries, traditionally clients of Russia, are behaving "insolently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Karabakh and Armenia:** In the latest [[russia_and_ukraine_conflict_dynamics | military clash]] between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan enjoys Turkish support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Russia offered to defend Armenia's territorial integrity only if it joined the Union State, explicitly excluding Karabakh from this guarantee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This offer is deemed suicidal for Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **CSTO Collapse:** Moscow is not acting as a reliable mediator, and the CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organization) is expected to inevitably collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Kazakhstan is reportedly considering suspending its membership next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Alternative Influences:** China (mainly in Central Asia), Turkey (second to China), and the United States (in the South Caucasus) are presented as alternatives to Russian influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Economic Failure
According to attendees, Putin had nothing to offer at the summit other than resources, mainly to India and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. China, however, showed no interest in new gas pipeline projects like "Power of Siberia 2," with Xi Jinping ironically shaking his head at the proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### Physiological Failure (President's Health)
Many at the summit observed Putin's "terrible physical and mental shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. A video shows Erdogan, who is ill with diabetes, carefully supporting Putin's elbow to help him keep pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. It's suggested that summit-level loads are no longer physically or mentally possible for Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Media reports mentioned 12 doctors waiting for him at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. His strange statements and mannerisms suggest "something in the head of the Russian president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## [[military_situation_in_ukraine_and_russias_challenges | Military Situation in Ukraine and Russia's Challenges]]

### Ukrainian Offensive and Russian Defensive Actions
The conflict in [[military_and_political_situation_in_ukraine | Ukraine]] is characterized by Ukrainian offensive actions and Russian "exclusively defensive" actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This is seen as a "struggle for strategic initiative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. The recent successful counteroffensive in the Kharkov region has the potential to be the *beginning* of a turning point, though not yet the turning point itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

### Deficiencies in the Russian Army
The Russian army is described as lacking:
*   Forces and means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>
*   People <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>
*   Equipment (especially modern, but increasingly any equipment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>
*   **Moral and Volitional Qualities:** This is highlighted as the main deficiency, with no faith in victory or understanding of the meaning of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. This deficit is growing, becoming chronic, and could lead to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

### Impact on Cooperation with Russia
Ukrainian offensive actions and successful sabotage operations are causing those who might cooperate with Russia to doubt if it's worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. The hasty withdrawal of Russian armed forces from the Kharkov region, leaving those who cooperated unprotected, has intensified this disbelief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This "disbelief in Victory" and "moral deficit" extends beyond the military to the civilian population in [[military_and_political_situation_in_ukraine | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

## [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_russia | Mobilization Efforts and Internal Opposition]]

### Penal Battalions
Following the Kharkov defeat, the idea of using prisoners in armed actions, similar to the penal companies and battalions formed in 1942 after the Soviet Army's failure near Kharkov, became widely known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. The creation of such penal battalions is seen as an admission that the Russian Federation either cannot or does not want to carry out [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. It is argued that penal battalions have never won a war and are not a decisive force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. This is an attempt to compensate for human resource shortages while avoiding [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

### Opposition to Mobilization
Last week, two key security officers, Patrushev and Bortnikov, "spoke out against [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]]" in a harsh manner, even opposing the partial [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] that Putin had mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. It's noted that Patrushev had previously developed the [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] plan in spring and reported it as feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. Their opposition is attributed to increased risks and their reaction to the "political and physiological weakening of the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. After this "rebuke," Putin was reportedly in a "minor state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. While Putin might still try to declare [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]], its outcome is predicted to be "very, very sad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

## Political Implications and Future Outlook
The question facing the Russian elite is how to exit the current situation without losing face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. Ukraine, however, demands complete liberation of all Ukrainian territories, including Crimea, as a condition for negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. This is currently "absolutely unacceptable" for the Russian leadership as it would mean "recognition of a complete and final fiasco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

### Shift in US Stance
The United States, after closed consultations with Russia regarding ending [[military_and_political_situation_in_ukraine | military actions]] and concluding a peace treaty, unilaterally withdrew from these consultations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. A consensus has formed in the US that it is necessary to inflict a "decisive [[military_and_strategic_implications_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | military defeat]]" on Russia to achieve political change within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

### Russian Elite's Perspective on Putin
A growing sentiment among the Russian elite is a desire for Putin to "suddenly disappear somewhere," taking all responsibility for the "special [[military_and_political_situation_in_ukraine | military operation]]" and other negative developments of the past 20 years with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

### Alleged Assassination Attempt on Putin
Rumors of an assassination attempt on Putin began circulating in early September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. A "very famous or notorious telegram channel," whose information is said to be of "highest accuracy and reliability," first publicly reported this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. This information was picked up by various Western media outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. It is emphasized that it was an "attempt" rather than a fatal swing, possibly a "public warning" from forces with "long arms" who can reach him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. This could be a hint at demands or a push for Putin's "gradual departure...in a completely legalistic way," transferring power to a newly formed, small, and effective State Council, possibly by the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

### Worsening Situation in Russia
Since February 24, time is perceived to be speeding up, particularly in Russia, with changes happening extremely quickly and affecting everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. The "drama and speed of these changes will increase," leading to a "sharp deterioration" this fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. This deterioration is expected to be primarily political, though it will certainly affect the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

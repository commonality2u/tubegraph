Last week, a significant symbolic political event in international politics was the granting of candidate status for European Union membership to Ukraine and Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. While actual acceptance into the EU is a considerable distance away, potentially taking ten years or more, and there's no guarantee Ukraine and Moldova will complete this path, this gesture symbolizes the West's readiness to support Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This commitment was reaffirmed at the G7 meeting that weekend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

Beyond the political aspect, this decision holds symbolic, historical-cultural, and even civilizational significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. It signifies that Ukraine and Ukrainian society have changed their civilizational vector, choosing Europe over the "Russian world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This shift occurred partly due to the efforts of the Russian Federation and President Putin, who "pushed Ukraine out of the potential embrace of the Russian world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Western Aid and Pressure for Peace

The core issue is not how soon Ukraine will join the EU, as that will not happen quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Instead, the focus is on how quickly and substantially the West will provide Ukraine with [[military_aid_and_strategy_in_the_Ukrainian_conflict | military aid]] and political support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This assistance is being provided by various countries, including Germany, which has been criticized for "shirking" military aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

However, there is a high probability of increasing behind-the-scenes, and sometimes overt, pressure from the same countries providing aid for Ukraine to agree to a [[ukrainian_and_russian_military_pressures_and_potential_compromises | peace treaty with Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The terms of this treaty are certainly under discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

> [!INFO] UK's Stance
> British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's statement before the G7 meeting was symptomatic, as he declared himself "categorically against forcing Ukraine to peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This public warning suggests that behind-the-scenes discussions regarding pressuring Ukraine are highly intense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Internal Problems Driving Western Pressure

The reason for this potential pressure on Ukraine to conclude a [[ukrainian_and_russian_military_pressures_and_potential_compromises | peace agreement]] with Russia stems from the internal problems faced by the Western countries providing political, symbolic, [[military_aid_and_strategy_in_the_Ukrainian_conflict | military]], and material support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. These problems include:

*   **Energy Issues**: Concerns about gas supply and the euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Germany, for instance, has publicly considered nationalizing part of the Nord Stream pipeline in its coastal waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Migration Consequences**:
    *   A potential flow of refugees from Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   The possibility of a food crisis leading to global hunger, which, although exaggerated by Russian media, could theoretically contribute to migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
    *   The artificial direction of migrants and refugees from North Africa and the Middle East to Europe, a situation that occurred between 2015 and early 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

It is highly probable that at least some Western countries will exert pressure on Ukraine to conclude an agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The [[us_aid_to_ukraine_and_its_implications | American side]] is likely no exception, as the current administration's main problems are domestic, particularly with upcoming midterm elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Western Perspective Shift
> The attitude towards Putin has changed among the Western establishment, particularly in key countries of "old Europe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. They have stopped respecting Putin, not because of the special military operation itself, but because he could not and cannot quickly lead it to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This shift indicates a move from fear to "contempt and mockery" of the Russian president and the Russian Armed Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

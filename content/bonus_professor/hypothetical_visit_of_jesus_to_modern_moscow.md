Political analyst Valery Soloviev presents a thought experiment regarding a hypothetical visit of Jesus Christ to modern-day Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Immediate Arrest Predicted

Soloviev posits that if the "Son of God" were to come to Moscow today, his preaching would be very short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. He predicts an instant arrest, without the need for a Sanhedrin meeting or complaints from priests or Pharisees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Violations of Russian Law

The immediate arrest would stem from the violation of two fundamental laws of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>:

1.  **Ban on Unauthorized Public Events**
    Any public event in Russia is often deemed unauthorized by court decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
2.  **Law on Fakes Against the Russian Armed Forces**
    If Jesus were in Moscow, he would likely repeat the Sixth Commandment, "Do not kill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Soloviev states that in Russia, this commandment is literally banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Holding a poster with "Do not kill" in any Russian city, regardless of location, would lead to immediate detention and accusation of spreading "fakes against the Russian armed forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Predicted Outcome

Soloviev concludes that while Christ would likely not be crucified today, he would "definitely be given a ten" (referring to a 10-year sentence) without hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. He characterizes this scenario as a "medical accurate description of Russian reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, suggesting that "clinical madness is increasing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

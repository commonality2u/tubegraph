The COVID-19 pandemic and its handling by the Russian government have had significant [[economic_conditions_in_russia | economic implications]] for the country, exacerbated by declining oil prices.

## Government Response and Economic Policy
The Russian government, particularly President Vladimir Putin, has been reluctant to take direct responsibility for difficult decisions and implement strict quarantine measures, preferring to shift the burden to Moscow Mayor Sobyanin and regional governors [00:01:52]. Despite demanding actions, the Kremlin has not provided adequate resources to these local authorities [00:02:07].

Russia has avoided declaring a state of emergency, opting for a legally undefined "self-isolation" regime [00:02:17]. This approach allows the government to evade financial and legal responsibility to society, unlike Western countries that provided significant support to their populations [00:02:26].

## Financial and Budgetary Conditions
While official figures suggest Russia possesses sufficient gold and foreign exchange reserves and a National Welfare Fund [00:02:54] to support society, particularly small and medium-sized businesses [00:03:03], the reality paints a different picture. Russia remains critically dependent on oil prices [00:03:12]. Government estimates indicate that, under the prevailing conditions, current funds may only last until October or November [00:03:21]. This has led to measures such as limiting expenses [00:03:33] and persistent proposals to devalue the ruble to 100 per dollar to compensate for lost budget revenues, a move Putin has resisted [00:03:38].

The country's budget is reportedly not as robust as official statements imply [00:03:16]. Accepting economic measures that require significant budget depletion is seen as very risky, especially with low oil prices [00:10:54].

## Impact on Employment and Business
The "self-isolation" regime, which involved voluntary-forced holidays, has caused widespread disappointment and despair, particularly among Putin's traditional electorate [00:05:17]. Businesses and workers expected a broad program of assistance and support, but none was announced, leaving governors without the necessary resources to provide aid [00:05:55].

The economic consequences are severe. A single month of quarantine is estimated to result in at least one million unemployed in Moscow alone, and approximately 9-10 million across Russia, representing over a tenth of the entire working population [00:37:58]. Small and medium-sized businesses are particularly vulnerable [00:03:07].

## Russia's Economic Readiness for Isolation
Despite being under [[economic_sanctions_and_their_effects_on_russia | sanctions]] for an extended period and implementing import substitution programs, Russia was not well-prepared for widespread isolation [00:38:21]. This notion is described as a "propaganda myth" [00:38:47].

Russia's dependence on imports remains very high [00:39:06]. The country has struggled to even produce the required number of masks [00:39:10] and conduct sufficient mass testing [00:39:14]. For example, Moscow performs only about 6,000 tests daily, with questionable accuracy, while the UK does 100,000 and the US 200,000 [00:39:14]. Many regions have no testing at all [00:39:34].

The government system has been deemed "completely ineffective" in solving problems, even those related to mobilization efforts for essential supplies [00:40:08]. Bureaucratic hurdles, such as requiring customs duties for charitable masks and tests, further hinder efforts [00:40:22].

## Instability and Future Outlook
The system is beginning to "fall apart" [00:41:09], with mass resignations of mid-level officials in some regions, particularly in the south of Russia [00:42:13]. These officials fear taking responsibility for potential failures and subsequent arrests [00:42:21].

The pandemic is contributing to [[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_russia | qualitative political changes]] and [[impact_of_political_actions_on_russian_society_and_economy | political instability]] within Russia [00:06:50]. The political structure that has existed for the past 20 years is described as beginning to collapse rapidly, potentially taking on an "avalanche-like character" [00:33:52]. This means authorities may soon be more concerned with survival and confronting domestic political issues than with the lifting of [[impact_of_sanctions_on_the_russian_economy | sanctions]] [00:34:03].

The [[the_economic_situation_in_russia_and_its_future_prospects | future economic prospects]] are uncertain, as global economic growth is needed for high oil prices, which is unlikely to happen soon [00:19:21]. Oil prices are expected to remain in a low range not only for the rest of the current year but also for a significant part of the next [00:19:50].

According to Valery Solovey, a meeting between Putin and Prigozhin, along with Wagner private military company commanders on June 29, did not occur, despite statements from President Putin's press secretary Peskov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The Kremlin reportedly plans to present fake photos and video documents depicting a staging where [[role_and_influence_of_putins_doubles | Putin's double]] and Wagner commanders will be shown from behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Role and Appearance of Doubles

[[role_and_influence_of_putins_doubles | Putin's doubles]] have been used to replace the current president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. They appeared at least in the second decade of the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Their use intensified after the Crimean epic in 2014, and even more so from 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The elite is reportedly well aware that [[Putins leadership and political influence | Putin]] widely uses doubles, and he no longer appears publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

### Purpose
The use of [[role_and_influence_of_putins_doubles | doubles]] contributes to the process of "delegitimization of power," where authorities lose trust and belief from the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This loss of trust is considered the first step to dismantling power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The next step in this process is delegitimization in the eyes of Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

When recruited, [[role_and_influence_of_putins_doubles | doubles]] were promised that after the operation, their original appearance would be restored through plastic surgery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. They were also promised a significant amount of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. However, there are serious doubts about whether these promises will be fulfilled by those who made them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

The possibility of a double traveling for a foreign meeting, such as a planned trip to Turkey, has been discussed, raising questions about the risk involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. It is also suggested that [[role_and_influence_of_putins_doubles | Putin]] and a double could potentially go together, with the double appearing in public walk-through areas while the real Putin conducts negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

## Future of the Doubles

In the event of the real Putin's death, the [[role_and_influence_of_putins_doubles | doubles]] will not rule Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. While it's possible they might replace [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin]] for a short period, this period is expected to be brief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

On April 18, 2022, political analyst and doctor of historical sciences, Valery Solovyov, discussed the ongoing [[potential_military_and_political_conflicts | armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine]], highlighting it as the "main nerve of Russian politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. He noted that future developments in Russia will be dominated by this conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Approaching the Culmination of Conflict

Solovyov suggests that the armed confrontation is nearing its culmination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Reasons for Culmination
From the Russian perspective, the Kremlin has failed to achieve any of its combat missions or political goals set at the campaign's start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The unexplained loss of the cruiser Varyag, lack of public mourning, and unreleased casualty figures have created a "painful impression" and call into question the effectiveness of the "limited special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The Russian leadership urgently needs a strategic turning point on the fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

On the Ukrainian side, supported by the West, there is no intention to meet Russia's ultimatum demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The West publicly states that the outcome of peace talks will be determined on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, and Ukraine believes it can inflict significant damage on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Symptoms of Culmination
Key indicators of the impending culmination include:
*   Concentration of Russian troops in Donbass to create a "cauldron" for Ukrainian forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   Rapid and substantial shipments of complex and strike weapons from the West to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   The Battle of Donbass is viewed by all parties as the central event of the confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   Information from senior Russian military sources indicates a lack of confidence in victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   The confrontation is expected to be "extremely fierce" due to escalating bitterness between parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Escalation Risks

Solovyov emphasizes the "very high" risk of escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, comparing the current global situation to the Cuban Missile Crisis, possibly even more acute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Use of Mass Destruction Weapons
If Russia fails to achieve its military objectives or force Ukraine into a favorable peace treaty, the risk of using weapons of mass destruction, including low-yield tactical nuclear weapons, increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Discussions about using tactical nuclear weapons are ongoing in relation to the Donbass situation and are confirmed by Western sources, including American military and intelligence, such as the head of the CIA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

Weapon of mass destruction also implies chemical and bacteriological weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Russian and self-proclaimed republics' defense ministries have hinted that Ukraine may commit provocations against civilians or possess chemical weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, which Solovyov sees as transparent hints about potential escalation mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Interruption of Supply Chains
Given Ukraine's effective resistance due to Western weapon supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, there's a temptation to interrupt these logistical chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This could potentially involve a tactical nuclear strike on Ukrainian territory or a neighboring country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Strikes on Russian Territory
Another escalation mechanism is when Ukraine, or the "opposing side," strikes military and civilian targets in Russian regions adjacent to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Ukraine is expected to receive missiles capable of reaching Russian military airfields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Terrorist Attacks
Terrorist attacks in Moscow and other large Russian cities are also identified as a potential trigger for escalation, with vague hints appearing in official Russian media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Potential Future Developments

Beyond the immediate culmination, Solovyov outlines three possibilities for [[future_political_changes_and_the_role_of_international_relations | future developments]]:

1.  **Peace Treaty**: This is considered highly unlikely due to the "unrealizable" demands Russia makes on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
2.  **Truce**: A cessation of hostilities, either partial or full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
3.  **Continuation of Positional Battles**: A truce followed by prolonged, sluggish military actions, potentially lasting until the end of 2022 or longer, as suggested by American sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## Internal Political and Economic Implications in Russia

The failure of the "limited military operation" has led to purges and increased tension within the Russian elite, reminiscent of [[historical_and_current_political_implications_in_russia | historical precedents]].

### Purge of Security Forces
The initial concept of the military operation failed, and blame is being assigned to individuals close to the president who provided information or instilled false hope about Ukraine's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Key figures affected include:
*   Minister of Defense Shuryga (in disgrace) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   The former head of the 5th service of the FSB (responsible for operational information on Ukraine and behind-the-scenes preparation), who is reportedly in a pre-trial detention center and subjected to physical abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   A group of officers from the FSB department are giving confessions under duress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   Problems also exist within the Main Directorate of the General Staff (military intelligence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

Solovyov asserts there is no conspiracy or split within the elite, but rather increasing tension and disorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. A purge is expected once the special military operation concludes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

### Impact on Big Business and Economy
Tension and disorganization are also rising among Russia's top bureaucracy and big business due to:
*   **The impending purge**: A "settling of scores" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
*   **Strengthening Sanctions**: [[western_influence_and_geopolitics_involving_russia | Western sanctions]] are becoming increasingly sensitive and difficult for the Russian economy, leading to technological degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **Asset Seizure and Nationalization Talks**: The seizure of Russian oligarchs' assets abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>, combined with revived conversations within the Russian security environment about the nationalization of large private assets, creates significant nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## Broadening Dehumanization and the End of an Era

Solovyov observes subtle signs of "dehumanization" within the security forces, coupled with "fears and confusion" among the highest elites who anticipate a worsening situation and a "very sad outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

He draws a parallel to the Russian Empire during World War I, noting that while it took three years then for the process of "dukhatization" (demoralization/exhaustion) to occur, the current path is being traversed much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. The authorities are attempting to "tighten the screws" to prevent this, but Solovyov warns that a "rusty structure" will crumble when tightened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

He concludes that there is a mass feeling of exhaustion for the "Putin era," which is coming to an end, likely not triumphantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

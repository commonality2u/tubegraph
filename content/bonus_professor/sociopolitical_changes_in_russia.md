This article outlines potential and ongoing [[internal_political_developments_in_russia | sociopolitical dynamics]] and reforms discussed in relation to Russia's future.

## Future of Political Power in Russia
The current political crisis in Russia is beginning to unfold, with the main events anticipated for the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. These events are not merely a transfer of power within the framework of preserving the Putin regime, but rather a [[political_transition_in_russia | radical change of power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. The "secret team" or "non-public teams" have developed strategies for almost all scenarios of situation development, though their essence is not disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

## Impact of External Events
The political fate of Lukashenko, the President of Belarus, is tied to events in Russia; he is not expected to last long once the government changes radically in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

On the military front, a defeat typically exacerbates political tension and deepens a crisis, while victories improve the reputation of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. However, it is anticipated that there will be no resounding victories or crushing defeats for Russia throughout December (of the current year) and the next year, with the status quo at the front largely maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

## Social and Economic Considerations
### Future for Young Generations
The future for young people in Russia exists, but it depends on the participation of the advanced part of society in the unfolding [[potential_changes_in_russias_political_landscape | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. If society fights for its future and the future of its children and grandchildren, then young people will have "brilliant prospects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Conversely, if individuals are not ready to participate in this fight or do not believe in the country's ability to change, they should consider a migration strategy, especially while young, as it is easier to adapt abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

### Economic Issues and Public Psychology
There is a monstrous increase in prices for chicken eggs and meat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:15:00">[30:15:00]</a>.

Regarding the psychology of "halala" (obsequiousness or servility), giving people the opportunity to get rid of this feeling requires changing the legal, political, and economic frameworks, putting respect for human dignity at the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:05:00">[23:05:00]</a>. While many may be accustomed to this way of life, it is believed that younger generations will be freed from the need to behave submissively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:50:00">[23:50:00]</a>.

### Preparedness for Crisis
In the event of an acute political crisis, potentially involving armed force mainly in the Russian capital and a few other cities, it is advised to have a reserve of provisions for a week or 10-14 days, drinking water, batteries for charging devices (due to potential electricity problems), and cash (as online payments may be disrupted) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:05:00">[24:05:00]</a>. There will be no famine in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>.

### Perspective on Putin's Death
The death of "Putin" (referring to the original or a double) will not automatically lead to improvement; it is merely a chance, not an immediate one, as things are expected to worsen initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:39:00">[25:39:00]</a>. The hardest times are predicted to come after this event, lasting for months, not years or decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:54:00">[25:54:00]</a>. This death signifies the beginning of a chance for society to influence the situation, which will be realized later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:00">[26:20:00]</a>.

## Proposed Reforms and Changes
### Judicial and Security Agencies
The judicial system requires thorough cleaning, including complete and unexceptionable lustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>. Corrupt security agencies also need a thorough cleaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. These reforms are estimated to take about two years based on realistic plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

### Local Self-Government and Financial Transparency
To improve the situation in regions, local government needs to be developed with more powers and, critically, financial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. This includes a transition to budgetary federalism, where regions retain a significant portion of the funds generated in their territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. The current structure of housing and communal services is described as a "fraudulent organization" that needs complete reform and punishment for those who benefited corruptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:00">[22:08:00]</a>. Transparency in fund spending will be ensured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:46:00">[22:46:00]</a>.

### Electoral System
The upcoming presidential elections are predicted to be a "farce" even greater than in 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. Lustration will target the heads of election commissions and active accomplices of voting fraud, leading to court proceedings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>.

One proposed idea for elections is for voters to pay for the right to participate, which could increase voter responsibility and act as a selection mechanism for those truly interested in influencing their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00">[16:48:00]</a>.

### Renaming Streets and Dismantling Monuments
A proponent of renaming streets and dismantling monuments, the speaker suggests that in most cases, this decision should be left to local communities through a local referendum, as an element of self-government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

## Current Political Issues and Concerns
### Role of Security Agencies
The FSB and other security forces are considered a political authority in Russia, unique in the world, where intelligence and counterintelligence agencies are not typically trusted to govern a country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>. Their involvement in governance is attributed to "built-in defects of their thinking," not evil intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.

### Official Propaganda and NATO
It is possible to explain to Russians that NATO poses no threat and has never started a war against the Soviet Union or Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>. This would require a change in the vector and content of propaganda, creating new narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.

### Digital Money and Social Rating
There is no inherent connection between digital money and social rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:14:00">[27:14:00]</a>. Social ratings are viewed negatively and are assured not to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>. Digital money could be beneficial for financing budgetary organizations by providing transparency in spending, but its general use in settlements between citizens and the state is opposed due to concerns about excessive control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:30:00">[27:30:00]</a>.

### LGBT Rights
The ban on LGBT is criticized, stating that Russia's real problems are poverty, lawlessness, and the impudence of power, not who sleeps with whom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:35:00">[29:35:00]</a>. There is a risk of targeted persecution of LGBT individuals and those who differ in appearance, with accusations of spreading extremist ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:06:00">[34:06:00]</a>.

## Political Figures and Events
### Patrushev and Lukashenko
Nikolai Platonovich Patrushev is described as treating Alexander Grigorievich Lukashenko with "bad irritation and disbelief," partly due to the late President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. However, Patrushev is currently focused on consolidating power externally and is not ready to quarrel with the few remaining allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Patrushev and those behind him are considered the ones who will officially announce the end of the "president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a>.

### Mishustin and Medvedev
The dissolution of the government in early 2020, with Mishustin replacing Medvedev, was directly connected to plans for a massive hybrid operation against the Baltic countries (not Ukraine at that time), which was scheduled for March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This operation was reportedly "developed brilliantly" with good chances of success, but circumstances prevented it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

### Andrei Belousov
Andrei Belousov, a high-ranking government official with an understanding of economics, is reported to be actively assisting the "junta" in preparing "illegitimate" actions. He is known to gravitate towards security forces and advocate for a tough economic course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:00">[29:12:00]</a>.

### Elite Groups and Power Redistribution
Elite groups separated during the redistribution of power do exist and are expected to act before the elections, attempting to discredit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:19:00">[33:19:00]</a>. The exact timing of their actions is unknown, depending on the context and dynamics of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36:00">[33:36:00]</a>. These groups are motivated by fear for their own lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40:00">[32:40:00]</a>.

### Putin's Doubles
Research has been conducted, including in Britain, suggesting the presence of Putin's doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>. A phonoscopic examination concluded with 99% accuracy that the "Putin" who spoke on May 9, 2022, and the "Putin" at the World Russian People's Council in November are different individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a>. The double who spoke at the council is referred to as "Vasilich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>. A recent British investigation also supported this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:14:00">[20:14:00]</a>. Vasilich is aware of the original Putin's death, which led to a sharp increase in his security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:04:00">[28:04:00]</a>. He reportedly enjoys being the "first person" in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:19:00">[28:19:00]</a>.

### Occultism in the Elite
The popularity of occultism and magic is "very, very high" within the Russian elite. "Putin" himself is said to have resorted to various occult and shamanic rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:54:00">[31:54:00]</a>. There are no individuals with special "priestly" properties in the Russian government, except for one active and successful opponent of the current government who possesses extraordinary abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26:00">[31:26:00]</a>.

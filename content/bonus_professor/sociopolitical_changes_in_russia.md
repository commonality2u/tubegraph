[[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | Sociopolitical changes in Russia]] are dynamic and influenced by a multitude of internal and international factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Change is a natural process, and circumstances on a national scale, or relating to supreme authority, can shift opinions, relationships, and approaches frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This means plans and goals also evolve with changing circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Current Political Landscape

The positions of "Patrushev's group" are currently weakening at a rapid pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. While this group aims to strengthen control, evidenced by elements like the digital ruble, their intentions do not extend to implementing "digital physical slavery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Regarding public sentiment, new sociological data on societal moods are not widely available, and no extraordinary information has been shared recently from closed sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Military and Mobilization

The speaker indicates that the current confrontation could potentially end by the close of 2023, leading to peace negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. There is a preliminary agreement among warring parties to enter negotiations, though a peace formula has not yet been agreed upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The conflict has brought "colossal, incalculable losses" to the countries involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

Mobilization is seen as a way to demonstrate the country's readiness to continue and increase military efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Those mobilized are expected to be sent to the front, even with minimal preparation, to avoid scenarios similar to 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Organizationally and technically, everything is prepared for mobilization, which is expected to be carried out in a much tougher manner than previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

The outcome of the military confrontation is not yet certain, but the current situation appears to be leaning towards a "stalemate" or "positional war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

## Future Political Changes

The speaker's team has "highly worthy" candidates for the presidential chair, who are believed to be recognizable and have a very good chance of being elected or taking other management positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Future leadership will involve constant communication and direct feedback with society, unlike the current "humiliating, offensive, comedic manner" of presidential direct lines or press conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

### Post-Regime Actions
After a change in power, a broad amnesty for political and "near-political" articles is planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. There will also be rehabilitation for those innocently convicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. A special service or department will be created to restore the constitutional rights of citizens violated over the past 20-30 years and propose punishments for those responsible for these violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

The speaker believes that if Putin is "dismantled," the cessation of bombings in Ukraine will depend on his successor. Some may continue the military confrontation, while others might immediately announce a unilateral ceasefire and offer peace talks without preconditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Negotiations with Ukraine would be with "Russia, with the Russian leadership, but not with Putin," as he will no longer be able to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

In the future, Russia is expected to transition to a professional contract army, given the experience of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

## Economic and Social Reforms

The speaker's team plans to carry out significant reforms, including education and healthcare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. These reforms aim to be "good, understandable" and will focus on reducing paperwork for professionals like teachers and doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

Salaries for essential professionals such as teachers, doctors, and Ministry of Emergency Situations employees should be comparable to those of officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Overall, incomes for most people in Russia are "humiliatingly little" and need to be increased, along with pensions and social payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. The country reportedly has sufficient funds to implement these increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

While the Unified State Exam (USE) has had "lousy" implementation in some regions, the underlying idea is considered good. It is viewed as a valuable method for grading and ensuring social mobility, allowing students from remote regions to access elite universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Therefore, its cancellation is not planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

Customs duties on imported cars, particularly used cars from the USA and Japan, will be significantly reduced to saturate the market and satisfy demand, before focusing on developing a domestic automobile industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>.

Regarding large bank loans, a relaxation in this matter is expected after the change of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. People should prioritize their family's survival over paying off debts if it means depriving them of essential resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

### Rural Development
While some villages may not be revivable, the speaker believes it is possible to revive others by injecting technology and improving the quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. The Russian people have "earned the right to a decent life" through their labor and dedication, and the aim is to provide this to them, addressing their current "beggarly conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

### Law Enforcement
The existing police system, composed of many decent individuals, will undergo a gradual change. The system's rules and its "system-forming elements" (those at the top) will be altered, setting a new pattern of behavior for those below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. Those who have committed crimes against society will be punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>.

## Personal Involvement and Outlook

The speaker participates "literally" in things that can be called historical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a> and expresses a strong positive attitude towards all efforts aimed at changing the fate of Russia, emphasizing the need for unification of efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. He considers himself a 100% patriot, defining patriotism as love for one's country and people, not the state, and a desire to make life better, freer, wealthier, and more peaceful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

He predicts that declassified special objects, palaces, bunkers, and occult places will be open to the public "soon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. The speaker encourages financial support for ongoing projects, emphasizing that this is a contribution to a better future for Russia, its children, and grandchildren <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. Despite current difficulties, he expresses absolute certainty that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.

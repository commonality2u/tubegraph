The issuance of a warrant by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for Vladimir Putin on suspicion of committing war crimes is identified as a significant "event" rather than mere "information noise" in the current political landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. This contrasts with daily "information reasons" which produce "information noise" or "information garbage" that doesn't genuinely affect the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:35">[01:19:35]</a>. The main producer of this noise is typically [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | President Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, often through the use of [[allegations_of_putins_double | doubles]] for public appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

## Issuance of the Warrant
The International Criminal Court issued a warrant for [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin]] on suspicion of committing war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. This event has significantly influenced the situation in Russia and globally, and is expected to have an even stronger impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

## Impact and Influence of the Warrant

### Legal and Symbolic Significance
The warrant represents a crucial precedent and a first step in a legal process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. It marks a shift from political and propaganda-based persecution of senior Russian Federation officials to a legal plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. This has caused unease among Russian officials, who may publicly declare solidarity but are privately cringing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. There are also preparations for a trial concerning crimes on Ukrainian territory, with the United States ready to actively participate in organizing such a court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.

### Domestic Political Aspect
The warrant has a significant [[potential_political_consequences_for_putin_and_russian_establishment | domestic political impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. Prior to February 24th, 2022, [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Putin]] was seen as a guarantor of wealth and privileges by the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>. However, after that date, and further compounded by the warrant, he has become a "toxic asset" that the elite wishes to discard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. While the elite may react passively and with outward solidarity, there are groups within it capable of decisive actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. There is a growing sense that their desire and capabilities for such actions could increase significantly and translate into practical steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. This could serve as a trigger for certain actions, especially with the upcoming visit of Xi Jinping to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.

### International Political Aspect
Internationally, [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Putin]] is now considered a "toxic asset" and a "leper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. This means fewer people on the international stage will be willing to communicate with him, and it's understood that it's better not to deal with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. The Minister of Justice of Germany, for instance, stated that if [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Putin]] appears on German territory, he would be arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. This represents a "cardinal change" in the atmosphere surrounding the Russian president and the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.

### Impact on Putin's Mental State
The warrant has reportedly driven [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Putin]] into a deep depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>. While he may have anticipated such an outcome, it still came as a shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>. His mental state, which was already not at its best, has been further upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>. This situation increases the [[security_and_risk_concerns_for_putin | risk of unforeseen and dangerous actions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>. However, his closest circle understands this risk and is now seriously considering that the future, with its unpleasant consequences, is much closer than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>.

## Recognition and Non-Recognition
Russia does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. Other countries, including China, India, and the United States, also do not recognize its jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. Despite this, the announcement of the warrant itself has had a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. No one seriously expects the Russian president to voluntarily or forcibly end up in The Hague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

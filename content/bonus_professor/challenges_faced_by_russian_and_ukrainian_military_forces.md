Both Russia and Ukraine face significant challenges in the ongoing conflict, impacting their military operations, resources, and societal morale.

## Russian Challenges

### Positional Warfare and Limited Progress
The [[russian_military_operations_in_ukraine | special military operation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> has entered a positional phase, characterized by skirmishes with little advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. There have been no large-scale operations comparable to 1943, involving tank breakthroughs, cauldrons, or envelopments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Instead, battles are long and stubborn, often for populated areas previously unknown to the Russian public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Resource Limitations and Morale Questions
Unlike Ukraine, Russia has limited [[russian_military_strategy_and_challenges | military resources]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, and no other entity is providing it with military assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. There are "many questions" regarding the [[military_dynamics_and_morale_in_the_russia_ukraine_conflict | moral-political and moral-psychological state]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> of the Russian armed forces and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. An underlying issue is the unclear or constantly changing goals of the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Evolving Objectives and Strategic Doubts
Initially, the stated goals included [[russian_military_strategy_and_challenges | "denazification" and "demilitarization of Ukraine"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, implying [[russian_military_strategy_and_challenges | complete political control of Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a> and a change of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. These goals have since been "rewritten several times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a> to a more modest task of [[russian_military_operations_in_ukraine | complete control of Donbass]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> and potentially [[russian_military_operations_in_ukraine | control of the Azov coast and the Black Sea coast]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Some high-ranking Russian [[russian_military_strategy_and_challenges | military leaders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, including from the General Staff, doubt that even the limited [[russian_military_strategy_and_challenges | military goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a> of the second stage of the special operation can be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The overall [[ukrainian_and_russian_military_pressures_and_potential_compromises | strategic turning point]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> for Russia remains distant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Mobilization Discussions and Putin's Logic
To achieve a strategic turning point, two tools are considered: crushing Ukraine's armed forces with [[challenges_in_recruiting_contract_soldiers_in_russia | mass mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a> of human resources, or inflicting [[russian_military_strategy_and_challenges | tactical nuclear strikes on Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. The Security Council, under Nikolai Patrushev, claims that from an organizational and technical standpoint, everything is ready for [[challenges_in_recruiting_contract_soldiers_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, and that [[challenges_in_recruiting_contract_soldiers_in_russia | mass mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> will not lead to negative political consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

A decision regarding [[challenges_in_recruiting_contract_soldiers_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a> has been made by the Russian President, although the timing for its implementation is not yet designated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. It is planned to mobilize about half a million people in several stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Methods to enforce mobilization could include police officers with specialists visiting homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, blocking bank cards of those subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, and closing borders for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Such mobilization would need to be preceded by events justifying it, such as perceived existential threats from Ukraine, potentially including a chemical attack or terrorist attacks in major Russian cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This would allow the conflict to be reclassified from a "special military operation" to a full-fledged, large-scale war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, also potentially legitimizing the use of tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

Experts often dismiss certain actions as "unprofitable" or "counterproductive" for Putin, but his logic is fundamentally different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. What might seem irrational to observers is rational within his worldview and based on his premises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

### Internal Atmosphere of Despair
There are psychological symptoms indicating that things are "not going very well" in Russia, particularly among the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. These include hysterical statements from TV presenters and mass media figures, and cynical remarks from ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Despair and anger are palpable in the Russian Federation, affecting both the general population and high-ranking officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

## Ukrainian Challenges

### Resource Attrition and Demoralization Efforts
[[russian_military_strategy_and_challenges | Russian military policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> toward Ukraine has had two main goals: to knock out Ukraine's resources and to demoralize Ukrainian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The aim was to force the Ukrainian government into a peace treaty on Russian terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. However, this goal has not been achieved, as resources continue to flow into Ukraine, and at a faster rate than Russia can neutralize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Societal and Military Resilience
For Ukraine, a strategic turning point is a question of resources, not only military but also moral and psychological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Ukraine is largely provided with an uninterrupted supply of military-technical resources, supported by its Western allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Key challenges for Ukraine include the ability of its society to bear the burdens of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> and the capacity of its armed forces to resist skillfully and, if necessary, launch a counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

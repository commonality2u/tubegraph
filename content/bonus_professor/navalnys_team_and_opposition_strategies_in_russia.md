Valery Solovey, a speaker and analyst, discusses the political landscape in Russia, including the future of the opposition and the challenges faced by figures like [[alexei_navalny_situation | Alexei Navalny]]. He offers insights into various aspects of Russian society and politics, from economic forecasts to the dynamics within the ruling elite and the broader opposition.

## Current State of the Opposition

The speaker observes that the [[russian_political_analysis | Russian political analysis]] of the opposition is complex. He declines to express personal attitudes toward individual opposition figures, instead focusing on their views and assessments [02:28:21]. He emphasizes the importance of diverse opinions, even those he considers erroneous or "idiotic," in line with liberal freedom [02:50:00].

## Challenges Faced by [[alexei_navalny_situation | Alexei Navalny]]

[[alexei_navalny_situation | Alexei Navalny]] is currently in prison. Solovey states that he and the audience are "not able to help him in any way now" [01:45:00]. The focus for [[navalny_imprisonment_and_political_protests_in_russia | Navalny's imprisonment and political protests]] is on publicity and the dissemination of information [01:43:00].

## Navalny's Team and Other Opposition Groups

Solovey notes that the opposition generally struggles with internal dialogue, with the exception of [[alexei_navalny_situation | Navalny's team]] [05:58:00]. He attributes the team's reluctance to communicate with other oppositionists to their belief that they possess "key assets" â€” organizational, media, and symbolic assets (embodied by [[alexei_navalny_situation | Alexei Navalny]] himself) [05:09:00].
The team believes they hold a "controlling stake" and that others should follow their lead [05:28:00]. However, Solovey believes this stance is "not very correct" and that the current situation is "more complicated and not in favor of Navalny's team" [05:35:00]. He expresses hope that over time, different segments and groups within the opposition will eventually find common ground [05:49:00].

## Potential for Political Change in Russia

Solovey is certain that Russia is heading for a "serious political crisis" [01:44:00], which he describes as "very sharp, cardinal, and large-scale" [02:27:00]. During this crisis, he believes the interests of society and a portion of the elite could converge [02:30:00].

He suggests that 2023 has "every chance to become a decisive year" for Russia, offering an opportunity to "influence in the most decisive way not only our own destiny but the destiny of our country and our people" [01:15:10]. He urges listeners not to "blow this chance" as many others have been [01:15:32].

### Future Transformations
*   **Political System**: Solovey envisions a future Russia that will be a "Democratic republican state" [01:07:53]. He emphasizes that this transformation will not happen overnight and will require a fight for democracy [01:15:00].
*   **Human Rights**: In post-Putin Russia, all laws violating fundamental human rights will be canceled [02:16:00]. Those responsible for developing these laws will face punishment [02:33:00]. A new service, possibly within the Ministry of Internal Affairs or a separate entity, will be created to protect and restore citizens' constitutional rights, including compensation for those whose rights suffered [02:39:00].
*   **Economic Transformation**: Russia will undergo a "truly large-scale economic transformation" [03:21:00]. This will create opportunities for Russians living abroad to contribute their knowledge, technologies, experience, and capital [03:25:00]. He suggests that Russia could become a country with "very high margin" where one can "earn very decently" [03:43:00].
*   **Social Reconciliation**: After major events, society will have to "get along" with veterans and "Putinists" [01:00:09]. This will involve the formation of veteran unions and political parties based on these groups, and the continuation of narratives about betrayal [01:00:17]. Solovey advises being prepared to treat this calmly as it is inevitable [01:00:37].

## Role of Russians Abroad
Russians living abroad have limited opportunities to influence the current situation, primarily through financial assistance to worthy people, organizations, or initiatives [03:35:00]. They can also protect the interests of [[navalny_imprisonment_and_political_protests_in_russia | Russian political prisoners]] by organizing protests, pickets, and solidarity events at Russian embassies or government buildings in their respective countries [03:51:00].

However, once the situation in Russia begins to change radically, especially economically, their knowledge, technologies, and experience will be valuable for Russia's large-scale economic transformation [03:10:00]. This presents both a patriotic and pragmatic incentive, as Russia will offer significant economic opportunities [03:41:00].

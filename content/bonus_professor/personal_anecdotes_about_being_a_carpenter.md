A speaker proudly shares their experience as a carpenter, emphasizing the importance of being able to work with one's own hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

## Fourth-Category Carpenter Qualification

The speaker holds a qualification as a fourth-category carpenter, which they received while working in a construction team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. Despite their [[Impact of Political Changes on Daily Life | fate]] turning out differently and not progressing to a fifth or sixth category, they remain proud of this initial achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. They express happiness in discussing this experience because it taught them how to build things with their own hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. As a fourth-category carpenter, they "know how to build windows" and can "expand if necessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

## Acquiring the Qualification

The fourth-category qualification was obtained in a student detachment while working "in a coma in the USSR" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. This categorization was necessary to receive payment, which was a "decent" sum of around 1,000 rubles at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. The speaker considers this a "serious qualification," even if it was a "formal category" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

The work involved performing "a certain amount of work," specifically "major repairs of small houses" where they "demolished the roof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. The speaker notes that "our guys" from the student detachment were also involved in large-scale projects like the Vostochny Cosmodrome and the construction of Olympic facilities in Sochi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. They still possess this qualification, though they are unsure how it was formally documented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

### Presidential Proof

The speaker recalls a conversation with "the President of the United States" who expressed disbelief about their carpentry skills and requested proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. The speaker was prepared and provided the proof, to which the U.S. President allegedly responded, "Well, I'll kick their ass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. This exchange occurred during a time when the speaker suggested trilateral cooperation between "Russia USA Europe," which was met with interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. The specific year of this interaction is not remembered by the speaker, but they state it can be easily found online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

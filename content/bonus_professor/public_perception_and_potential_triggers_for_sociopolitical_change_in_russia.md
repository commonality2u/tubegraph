The world is currently experiencing a period of transition, not yet marked by widespread conflict or societal upheaval, but rather a slow, continuous shift. This transition, which began in the 1990s, is largely linked to the collapse of the Soviet model of socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The prevailing sensation is one of moving away from the clearly ordered world that existed in the mid-1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, a world that reached its peak complexity and maturity in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Characteristics of the Changing World

The ongoing technological revolution, while colossal, is observed to lead to the simplification and unification of human nature, alongside a decrease in general intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This is evident in the decline of interest in and disappearance of the vast culture developed by European and global civilization by the end of the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Education, once a tool for overcoming social discrimination, now contributes to segregation, with a stark difference between students in mass universities and those in elite institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The ability to read large texts or build complex strategies is becoming an "unsolvable task" for many young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

The future world is anticipated to have a massive number of restrictions, though people may not perceive them as such due to a lack of initial intellectual capacity or the will to acquire knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This current generation, raised in a world saturated with gamification and illusion, often lacks the desire or will to break through the surface of simulacra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This emerging reality echoes the themes of Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World," where individuals are so integrated into systems that their personal existence diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. There is a sense of living on the "ruins of the ancient world," where artifacts remain but their meaning is lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Elite Dynamics and Occult Influence

The dominant group in this changing world is seen as the financial elite, which remains largely hermetic and disinclined to expand its circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. There are about a dozen to a dozen and a half influential non-public organizations in the world, distinct from groups like the Masons, whose peak influence is long past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. These influential groups consist of the "cream of Western society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

Notably, the "cream of Russian society" is not accepted into these circles, causing significant irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. The reasons for this exclusion include a lack of consistent identity (e.g., former communists turning into "pure Denikin and Kolchak" supporters) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a> and a perceived lack of a mission beyond acquiring wealth and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Unlike their Western counterparts, who exhibit a sense of historical responsibility for their nation and mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>, Russian elites are often seen as only interested in "beans and money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. This mutual distrust, especially towards Russian security officers, creates serious problems for professional interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

> [00:23:48] "She is very afraid, she is very afraid in fact of change, she is very afraid that the situation will get out of control."

There is a fierce, literal "fight of bulldogs under the carpet" among those contending for power, including figures like Kovalchuk, Timchenko, Igor Ivanovich, Patrushev, Medvedev, and Sobyanin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. Beyond typical intrigues, these power struggles involve occult means, with some turning to Siberian shamans or those from Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. The demand for such practices, including rituals involving animal sacrifice, has sharply increased since 2014, reflecting a growing sense of instability and a desire to preserve assets and positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. The Russian elite's recourse to magic and occultism, and even a primitive approach to Orthodoxy, is seen as a means to gain control in an unpredictable environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

This reliance on occultism highlights a deeper insecurity within the Russian authorities regarding their legitimacy, pushing them to seek "real rulers of this world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. This self-doubt, combined with an inability to buy their way into established international circles, leads them to resort to brutal repression and aggressive displays of strength to instill confidence in themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>. They are afraid of change, of losing control, and of Western values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. They are willing to sacrifice anything except their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>, which they increasingly store in physical form, such as tons of dollars or gold in "real storage" abroad, particularly in Africa and Latin America, which offer inaccessibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:58">[00:54:58]</a>.

## Public Perception and Potential Triggers for Change

Despite the apparent stability, a colossal demand for change exists within Russian society, shared by more than two-thirds, possibly even three-quarters, of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This level of demand was last seen in 1990-1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. This demand is also strongly linked to a desire for freedom, as recorded by sociologists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>. However, there are no clearly defined "subjects of change" with a unified political face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. Unlike past historical movements, the "great sleeping Russian people" no longer exist as a unified entity; Russian villages are dead, and urban lumpen have a virtualized consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. The current authority's only possible response to this lack of meaning in history is an increase in terror and dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>.

The political mass dynamics are unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. While the authorities have reached the limit of their repressive capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>, and current methods lead to paralysis of the state apparatus rather than efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>, a "trigger" is needed to ignite widespread change. Examples like protests in Khabarovsk, Bashkiria, or against landfills, show significant potential for localized action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.

Potential national triggers could include:
*   **Economic factors**: A rapid, significant devaluation of the ruble (e.g., another 30-40% within a week) followed by a denomination and exchange of banknotes, which is ready to be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:32">[00:36:32]</a>. Such an event is capable of causing a "very strong mass series" of reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.
*   **Political factors**: The beginning of a power "transit" process, where the "bulldogs under the carpet" realize one of them is losing and then turn to society for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. Once society engages, the game becomes unpredictable, as "you can squeeze toothpaste out of the tube... but you will never be able to stuff it back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

These non-public organizations, while not a "world government," aim to maintain global balance and believe the Kremlin is disrupting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. They recognize the "free will" of people and the limitations of manipulative mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. The "nationality sovereignty," when fully realized, is capable of destroying everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>. The authorities' lack of confidence in their own legitimacy contributes to their fear of these external forces and the potential for public uprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

The situation is incredibly fragile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>, with the system pupating and elements focused on self-survival, while society is increasingly agitated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>. The irritation of everyday people is "extremely great," and their attitude towards the authorities is simply: "they have become here, us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. The current year and the next are expected to be surprisingly eventful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

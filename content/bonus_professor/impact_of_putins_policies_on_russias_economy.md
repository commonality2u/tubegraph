[[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | President Vladimir Putin]] has been described as the main producer of "information garbage" within Russia, with his speeches and appearances often serving as mere "information reasons" rather than significant "events" that affect the country's real situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Despite the rhetoric, the economic and social consequences of his policies have become increasingly apparent.

## Economic Deterioration and Impact on Income

The "special military operation" and [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin's policy]] are directly linked to a significant decline in the living standards of Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. Data from the past week indicates that the ongoing conflict has "zeroed out 10 years of labor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. Specifically:
*   Real incomes of Russians are 6.5% lower than in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   The actual volume of goods consumption is 9.1% less than in 2013, described as the "last measured peaceful year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>.
This translates to "10 years down the drain" as a direct result of [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin's foreign policy]] and [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin's economic growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. This period of economic decline is anticipated to extend beyond 10 years, potentially reaching "almost a quarter of a century torn out of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.

## Impact on Russian Business Elite

The relationship between [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin]] and the Russian business elite has undergone a significant transformation:
*   **Disappointment and Lack of Answers** Industrialists and entrepreneurs were reportedly "extremely disappointed" after a speech by [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin]], as they received no answers to their concerns or the challenges posed by modernity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Fear of [[impact_of_economic_sanctions_on_russia | Sanctions]]** Many wealthy individuals, including "admirals of Russian business," deliberately avoided a meeting with [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin]] to prevent falling under [[impact_of_sanctions_on_russia | sanctions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This highlights a shift from seeking proximity to [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin]] for "material dividends" to actively avoiding him due to the risk of [[impact_of_western_sanctions_on_russia | Western sanctions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **[[impact_of_economic_sanctions_on_russia | Toxic Asset]] Status** While [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin]] was once seen as a "guarantor of wealth and privileges" before February 24, he is now perceived as a "[[impact_of_economic_sanctions_on_russia | toxic asset]]" that the Russian elite wishes to discard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This sentiment is described as an internal "grumbling" within the elite, despite public displays of solidarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

## Mobilization and Economic Coercion

A "hidden, parallel, quiet, veiled" mobilization effort is underway in Russia, operating through various non-classical forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. This process involves:
*   **Document Verification** Citizens are invited to verify documents, a practice occurring in over 45 regions of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
*   **Summons for Military Training** Individuals receive summons for military training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. Some military commissariats explicitly state that mobilization "did not stop" due to the absence of a decree on its conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
*   **Blackmail, Threats, and Promises** The system relies on a "triad" of blackmail, threats of violence, and promises to compel people to join the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. This includes financial incentives, such as promised earnings of 195,000-200,000 rubles a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **High Demand for Personnel** A significant number of people are needed for the active army, with a goal of increasing personnel by 400,000 or more within the next one and a half to two months, ahead of a potential Ukrainian counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

Despite the belief in the Kremlin that there will be no protests, measures have been put in place to ensure compliance with this hidden mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

The rationale behind such [[potential_military_actions_and_geopolitical_influences | actions]] is that the presence of [[nuclear_threat_and_international_tensions | nuclear weapons]] in Iran would constitute an immediate [[nuclear_threat_and_international_tensions | threat]] to the existence of Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This situation underscores the [[the_implications_of_nuclear_weapons_policy | implications of nuclear weapons policy]] on [[international_relations_and_military_aid_involving_nato_and_iran | international relations]] and highlights the [[risks_of_escalation_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction | risks of escalation]].

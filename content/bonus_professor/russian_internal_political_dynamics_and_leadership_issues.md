## Overall Political and Military Context

The surrender of Azovstal fighters is considered a military and symbolic success for Russia, but it does not represent a strategic turning point in the armed confrontation with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Ukrainian troops conducted a successful counteroffensive, pushing Russian troops away from Kharkiv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Fierce battles continue on the Seversky Donets, which are not expected to be successful for the Russian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Regarding the Azovstal fighters, two scenarios are likely:
*   A public trial for participants of the "Azov" regiment, declared extremist in Russia, to demonstrate the justification of Russia's "denazification" demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   An exchange of other fighters for Russian prisoners of war, a decision to be made personally by the President of the Russian Federation based on political expediency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Russia appears to be less focused on achieving a strategic turning point and more on consolidating the current status quo, aiming to legalize its territorial gains through negotiations with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. These gains include the recognition of Crimea as Russian, Donbass as independent, and Russian control over the Kherson and parts of Zaporizhzhya regions, forming a land bridge to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Internal Dissatisfaction and Failed Programs

### The Import Substitution Program

For 14 years, Russia has had a bravura import substitution program, with gigantic funds allocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. However, after 8 years of implementation, a senator from the "KGB lobby" declared that the program has failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This statement is not just an attack on Minister Manturov and Rostec head Chemezov, who were responsible for the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

### KGB Lobby Discontent

The failure of the import substitution program reflects the discontent of the entire "KGB lobby" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. They reported to the President that the program was going wrong, being implemented under the guise of "Chineseization" rather than genuine import substitution, and serving personal and group interests instead of national ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. The KGB officers are deeply unhappy that President Putin trusted these individuals and continues to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## Leadership Stability and Future Prospects

### Weakening of the "Key Element"

Putin is considered the "key element" of the [[russian_political_system_and_leadership | Russian political system]], around whom the system revolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. The current [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | Russia]] is accurately described as "Putin's Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. The discontent of the security officers indicates that the system begins to "vibrate" and disintegrate as this key element weakens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### Health Concerns and Potential Transition

There are indications of President Putin's serious health problems, as reported by American director Oliver Stone and other sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. Discussions about his present and future, including health issues, are being closely monitored by interested parties within the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>. This suggests potential [[internal_political_dynamics_and_power_transition_in_russia | internal political dynamics and power transition]] are being considered.

### Instability of Acquired Territories

Despite official statements proclaiming territories like Kherson to be "forever with Russia," there's an acknowledgement of the historical precedent where such declarations about Soviet power proved temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Russia is actively constructing defensive fortifications in newly acquired territories, indicating preparations for defense rather than long-term, unchallenged control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. The construction and restoration efforts in areas like Mariupol and Donbass are seen as a "gold mine" for officials like Vice-Premier Khusnullin, as colossal budget financing is opened up without a clear long-term accountability if the status of the territory changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

Valery Soloviev, Doctor of Historical Sciences, political analyst, and public figure, discusses how [[comparison_of_modern_russia_with_medieval_times | historical parallels]] illuminate the current [[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | political and social landscape of Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Modern Russian Reality

Soloviev illustrates the current situation in Russia through a hypothetical scenario: if the son of God were to appear in Moscow, he would be instantly arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This immediate arrest would occur because he would violate two fundamental laws of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>:

*   **Ban on Unauthorized Public Events**: Any public event can be deemed unauthorized by court decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Law on Fakes Against the Russian Armed Forces**: Repeating the Sixth Commandment, "Do not kill," would be considered a "fake" against the Russian armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Holding a poster with this commandment in any Russian city would lead to immediate detention and accusation of spreading fakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

Soloviev suggests that the State Duma might soon demand changes to the text of Holy Scripture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. He asserts that this is not sarcasm but a "medical accurate description of Russian reality," describing the situation as "clinical madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Evolution of the "Foreign Agent" Law

The law on foreign agents has undergone significant changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>:

*   **Old Version**: Accused those who received financial assistance from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Even a small transfer could lead to being declared an agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **New Version**: Individuals can be designated foreign agents if they are "under foreign influence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This broad definition could potentially apply to almost every citizen of the Russian Federation, including those who use foreign languages for study, work, or travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **New Category**: A new category for "family members of agents" is being introduced in the bill, which Soloviev likens to Stalin's formulation of "families of traitors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Reasons for Escalating Repression

The increasing "clinical madness" is rooted in the [[economic_and_political_landscape_of_russia | military-political reality]], specifically the "special military operation" in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The military-political goals of this operation are becoming increasingly difficult to achieve, and the dynamics of military actions are on a downward trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The "victory" that the Supreme Commander-in-Chief desires is described as a "ghost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### The Blame Game

When things go wrong, someone must be blamed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Soloviev states that the Supreme Commander-in-Chief (referring to Vladimir Putin) cannot be blamed, drawing a parallel to the Stalinist era where "Comrade Stalin is never wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This refusal to admit mistakes is described as an "anthropological pattern" particularly strong in the [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Enemies of the People in Modern Russia

The concept of "enemies of the people" is being revived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. According to President Putin, the West's primary task is to "split Russian society [and] destroy the country from within," often organizing fakes and calls for illegal actions from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

This leads to two categories of "enemies of the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>:

1.  **Foreign Agents**: Cause "information damage" by spreading fakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
2.  **Outright Terrorists and Saboteurs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Historical Analogies for "Enemies of the People"

Soloviev draws on two historical experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>:

*   **Weimar Germany (1920s-1930s)**: The idea that Germany lost World War I not on the battlefield but because of a "stab in the back" by "moral decay and national traitors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. In modern Russia, foreign agents are seen as similar "moral decay traitors" attempting to "stick a knife in the back of society" and the armed forces through fakes and decomposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. The definition of who can be considered a "traitor" is broadening, including those with "insufficiently enthusiastic facial expression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **Stalin's Russia**: The idea that opposition leads to direct terrorist activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This logic determined the infamous Moscow Trials of 1936-1938, where defendants confessed to assassinations and plots on foreign instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.
    *   **Echoes in 2022**: Putin reported the capture of "neo-Nazis" allegedly preparing to murder TV presenter Vladimir Solovyov on Ukrainian security service instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Soloviev notes this as a "roll call of eras," though with a "lower pipe, thinner smoke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

## Future Developments and Outlook

Soloviev predicts that the next logical step will be the organization of public trials in Russia against foreign agents who have transitioned to terrorist activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. He believes that the fight against "fakes" will escalate to tens of millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

He asserts that in Russia, history repeats itself not as farce but as a second tragedy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. The country is only at the beginning of this process, and the "peaks" of fighting terrorists and exposing traitors are still ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. Despite the current difficulties for those in Russia who maintain moral sense or dignity, Soloviev offers a ray of hope, stating that "it will not last long" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. He encourages self-care, mutual help, and support for those who speak out in defense of human dignity and common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

On Friday, February 16, after 7:00 pm, news broke that [[political_implications_of_navalnys_death | Alexei Navalny]] had died or been killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The speaker, Valery, expressed condolences to the family, relatives, and friends of [[political_implications_of_navalnys_death | Alexei Anatolyevich]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, acknowledging that he is officially on a list of terrorists and extremists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Condolences were also extended to all who worked with, collaborated with, sympathized with, supported, and followed him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

[[political_implications_of_navalnys_death | Alexei]] was noted for his "amazing quality" of commitment to his goals and objectives, which was a "great achievement and a distinctive quality" of his as a politician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Unnatural Death and Political Murder

The speaker stated their inclination towards the second version—that it was a political murder—rather than a natural death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. An international etiological investigation would be needed to convince them that [[political_implications_of_navalnys_death | Alexei Navalny]]'s death was natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Even if it were natural, the speaker argued that the Kremlin had been creating "impossible conditions" for years to "freeze" [[alexei_navalnys_imprisonment_and_its_implications | Alexei]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. His years of imprisonment, including almost a year in a punishment cell, were precisely intended to critically impact his health and psyche, though [[alexei_navalnys_imprisonment_and_its_implications | Alexei]] "coped with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

The speaker reiterated their belief that it was a political murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, citing several indirect signs:
*   A very quick, unanimous reaction from the Russian official media, who reported the news "on command" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   An unusually quick reaction from Peskov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   At least two or three assassination attempts on "very dangerous and important opponents" of the elite group claiming full power in Russia within the past month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Expected Lies and Kremlin's Motive

The speaker anticipates "cynical lies and real nonsense" about the circumstances of [[political_implications_of_navalnys_death | Alexei Navalny]]'s death, which they consider a "murder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Expected narratives include:
*   [[political_implications_of_navalnys_death | Alexei Navalny]] being "alive and well and abroad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   The West sacrificing him to compromise the "so-called presidential elections" or blur the effect of "President [[death_of_vladimir_putin_and_new_reality_in_russia | Putin]]'s" interview with an American journalist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

This is seen as a "blurring" tactic by PR people, "throwing in the most notorious phantasmagoria" to distract attention from the essence of what is happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

A common argument is that it was "categorically unprofitable for the Kremlin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The speaker dismisses this, comparing it to similar claims made after the murder of Nemtsov, the [[navalnys_poisoning_and_its_implications_for_russian_politics | poisoning of Navalny]], and before the start of the "Russian military operation against Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. They assert that, in fact, it *is* profitable, logical, and consistent for the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

The logic is that the same people who conceived and led the [[navalnys_poisoning_and_its_implications_for_russian_politics | Navalny poisoning]] operation, which failed and put them in a "dangerous position," have now "completed this operation" to seek revenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. More broadly, they are trying to "remove any risks, remove any threats" on the eve of the "so-called presidential elections" and, most importantly, on the "eve of the transfer of power" to an elite group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. They want to "get rid of the slightest risks now, squeeze out all the grass, cement all the fields" where a threat might appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This is seen as "very profitable" now because "everything can be blamed on the quiet path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, with the blame falling on [[death_of_vladimir_putin_and_new_reality_in_russia | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Call for Transparency and International Investigation

To refute "slander" against the Kremlin, the speaker argues that the authorities should invite international and Western experts, specifically German ones, to conduct a public international examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Furthermore, they demand that the body of the deceased be given to the family for them to dispose of, not the Kremlin or the Federal Penitentiary Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. If the government does this, it would check the "natural suspicions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Lessons and Future Outlook

The speaker reiterated condolences to [[political_implications_of_navalnys_death | Alexei]]'s family, friends, and supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, noting that [[political_implications_of_navalnys_death | Alexei]] had "colossal political potential" that he had not fully used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

A crucial lesson is to love those who are alive, whether free or in prison, and to show them "love, respect, and kind words and the main help and support" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. The speaker fears that [[political_implications_of_navalnys_death | Navalny]]'s death is "only the beginning," and that Russian oppositionists, both inside and outside Russia, are under threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This event is a serious warning and a lesson for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

The speaker predicts that 2024 will not just be dramatic but "most likely will turn out to be tragic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, possibly the "hardest year" in people's entire lives, even more so than the year the pandemic began or the "special military operation" started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

In these difficult times, it is essential to "take care of health," "help your family and friends," as they are the "key to our stability and the key and conditions for our survival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Despite the tragic nature of the day and the heavy words, the speaker conveys "confidence" and "hope," firmly believing that "everything will change for the better and will begin to change already in this 2024" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The speaker concludes with the conviction that "victory will be ours for the sake of [[political_implications_of_navalnys_death | Alexei]], for the sake of all of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

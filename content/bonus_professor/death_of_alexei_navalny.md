From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

On Friday, February 16, somewhere after 7:00 PM, news broke regarding the death of [[alexei_navalnys_situation | Alexei Navalny]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. The speaker, Valery, conveyed condolences to the relatives, family, and friends of [[alexei_navalnys_situation | Alexei Anatolyevich Navalny]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, acknowledging that he was included in the list of terrorists and extremists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Condolences were also extended to all people who worked, collaborated with, or sympathized with and supported [[alexei_navalnys_situation | Alexei Navalny]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. [[alexei_navalnys_situation | Navalny]] was noted for his "amazing quality" of commitment to the goals and objectives he set as a politician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Circumstances of Death: Murder or Natural Causes?

The speaker stated an inclination towards the version of [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalnys_political_implications | political murder]] rather than natural death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. An international etiological investigation would be needed to convince otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Even if the death were natural, the Kremlin has been creating "impossible conditions" for years to "freeze [[alexei_navalnys_situation | Alexei]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Years of imprisonment, including almost a year in a punishment cell, were intended to critically impact his health and psyche, though [[alexei_navalnys_situation | Alexei]] coped with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Indirect signs pointing to [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalnys_political_implications | political murder]] include:
*   A very quick, unanimous reaction from Russian official media, reporting the news "on command" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   An unusually quick reaction from Peskov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   At least two or three assassination attempts on "dangerous and important opponents" of the elite group claiming power in Russia over the past month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Kremlin's Intent and Anticipated Narratives

The speaker anticipated "cynical lies and real nonsense" about the circumstances of [[alexei_navalnys_situation | Alexei Navalny's]] death, specifically calling it a murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Anticipated narratives include:
*   [[alexei_navalnys_situation | Alexei Navalny]] is alive and well abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   The West "sacrificed him" to compromise the "so-called presidential elections" or to blur the effect of "so-called President Putin's" interview with American journalist Carlson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This tactic is referred to as "blurring" â€“ throwing in "notorious phantasmagoria" to distract attention from the essence of what is happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   The argument that [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalnys_political_implications | it was categorically unprofitable for the Kremlin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

The speaker countered the "unprofitable for the Kremlin" argument by drawing parallels to past events such as the murder of Nemtsov and [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalnys_political_implications | the poisoning of Navalny]], and the start of the Russian military operation against Ukraine, all of which were widely deemed "unprofitable" but occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The actual logic is that the same people who conceived [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalnys_political_implications | Navalny's poisoning]] have now "completed this operation" to remove any risks or threats on the eve of the "so-called presidential elections" and, most importantly, the transfer of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This transfer of power is anticipated from a "double" (referencing [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death_and_replacement | Vladimir Putin's alleged death and replacement]]) to the elite group claiming power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The aim is to "get rid of the slightest risks now, squeeze out all the grass, cement all the fields where this grass may appear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The speaker reiterated that assassination attempts have been made against at least two or three opponents of the regime in the last month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Blame can now be easily placed, even on "the body that has been in the Valdai refrigerator since October 26" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Call for International Investigation

To refute "slander" against the Kremlin, the speaker demanded that the authorities:
1.  Invite international and Western experts, particularly German ones (where [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalnys_political_implications | Navalny]] was diagnosed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
2.  Conduct an international public examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
3.  Give the body to the deceased's family, allowing them to dispose of it instead of the Kremlin or the Federal Penitentiary Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Lessons and Outlook

The speaker stressed three important points:
1.  **Condolences:** Reiterate sympathy to [[alexei_navalnys_situation | Alexei's]] family, friends, and supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. [[alexei_navalnys_situation | Alexei]] had "colossal political potential" that he had not yet fully used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
2.  **Lesson:** "Only the dead they only know how to love the dead but not the living" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. The speaker urged people to love those who are alive and free, or even in prison, as "our love now and respect and kind words and the main help and support" are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
3.  **Warning:** The speaker fears that [[alexei_navalnys_situation | Navalny's]] death is "only the beginning" and that Russian oppositionists, both inside and outside Russia, are under threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

The year 2024 is predicted to be "very difficult," "tragic," and potentially the "hardest year in our entire life," surpassing the year the pandemic began or the "special military operation" started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Despite this, the speaker conveyed a message of confidence and hope that "everything will change for the better and will begin to change already in this 2024" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, and that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

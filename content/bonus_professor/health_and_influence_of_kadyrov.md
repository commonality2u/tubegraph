Ramzan Kadyrov is confirmed to be seriously ill, though not terminally so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This illness is described as very serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Information regarding the causes and diagnosis of his illness does not align with details published by Novaya Gazeta Evropa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Despite Kadyrov's illness, the question of his succession is not currently a practical issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. There is no truth to rumors that Kadyrov wishes to be appointed Minister of Internal Affairs; this has never been the case and is not expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

Regarding Chechnya's relationship with Russia in the event of a change in Russian leadership, a conflict is deemed extremely unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. It is more probable that the relationship between Chechnya and the new leadership would develop differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. The SVR General has stated that if his team comes to power, Chechnya would be allowed to go "free floating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. If a choice between war and "free floating" arises, the latter is considered preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

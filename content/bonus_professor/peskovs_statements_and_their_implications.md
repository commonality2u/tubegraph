From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Leri Solovey, during the 75th episode of "What's Happening," discussed a statement made by [[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Peskov]], the Secretary of the Russian President, and its implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The episode, released on Monday, July 10th, was re-recorded specifically to address this statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## The Statement and Its Refutation

[[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Peskov]] officially stated that on June 9th (later clarified as June 29th) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, Yevgeny Prigozhin and commanders of the Wagner private military company held a three-hour meeting in the Kremlin with President [[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. According to [[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Peskov]], the meeting occurred in a "good, positive atmosphere" and concluded on a "positive note" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

However, Leri Solovey directly refutes this, calling it "elementary brazen lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. He asserts that no such meeting with Prigozhin or PMC Wagner occurred on June 29th or at any time thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The most that could have happened, and even this is doubted by more substantial sources, was a telephone conversation between [[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Putin]] and Prigozhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Reasons for the Lies

According to Solovey, there are three primary reasons for the dissemination of this false information by [[moral_and_political_implications_for_russian_leadership | Russian leadership]] and [[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Peskov]]:

### 1. Upholding [[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Putin]]'s Reputation

The first reason is to portray [[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Putin]] as a "wise Leader" in complete control of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The fabricated meeting suggests that the recent events, despite [[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Putin]] having called Wagner fighters "vile rebels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, were part of a "cleverly conceived game" or "[[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Putin]]'s multi-move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This aims to bolster [[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Putin]]'s reputation, which "suffered catastrophically" after the Wagner mutiny in the eyes of the elite, the "deep state," and even parts of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### 2. Presenting [[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Putin]] as Physically Capable

The second reason is to demonstrate that [[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Putin]] is in control of the situation and is healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Solovey claims that recent public appearances, including the alleged presence of the president in Derbent and subsequent invitations and speeches, are "pure hoaxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Solovey states that the actual president "is physically unable to do this" and is constantly replaced by doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. He claims that two doubles are most frequently used, with one being very close in appearance to the president for speaking engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. He further asserts that "any representative of the [[moral_and_political_implications_for_russian_leadership | Russian elite]]" has no doubt about the existence of these doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

> "There is an examination conducted in one of the countries of the Big Seven. A phonoscopic examination, that is, by voice, and an anthropological examination. Several experts participated in it. Independently of each other, all the experts came to a unanimous conclusion. We see under the general name of the President of Russia three different people." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>

This deception is aimed at the general public to maintain an image of an "omnipresent president" around whom society is consolidating, who is "healthy, strong as never before" and leading the country to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Solovey notes that conversations about doubles are now happening at the highest level and among "any self-respecting intelligence service of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. He suggests that participating in these conversations, regardless of one's belief, contributes to the "delegitimization of the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

The speaker reiterates that the true president is in "worse physical condition" and is reportedly "blind already in his left eye," consistent with the development of metastasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The real president is said to be "in storage in a deep bunker from which he does not emerge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

### 3. Masking International Humiliation

The third reason for the lies is to cover up [[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Putin]]'s humiliation on the international stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

*   **Erdogan's Actions**: Solovey highlights Turkish President Erdogan's actions, such as transferring Azov fighters (banned in Russia) to Ukraine, supporting Ukraine's NATO accession, and promising intensive military aid and Bayraktar drone factory construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The Kremlin's silence in response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, is attributed to Russia's critical dependence on "parallel import" passing through Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.
*   **Macron's Refusal**: Previously, French President Macron sought frequent phone conversations with [[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Putin]], spending "almost 100 hours on the phone" in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Now, the Kremlin is trying to get Macron to agree to a telephone conversation with [[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Putin]], but the French president is refusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Kremlin servants are attempting to reach Macron "in a roundabout way" to convince him to talk to [[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

## Conclusion

The speaker concludes that these actions indicate that [[russian_political_analysis | Russian elite]] and Western elite understand that [[analysis_of_the_russian_presidents_speech | Putin]] is not just a "lame duck," but a "dying nature" incapable of making public decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Regional and international trips are undertaken by a double, not the actual president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

The speaker notes that the public perception of the recent events, which he refers to as a "coup that did not take place" or an "armed rebellion," is that it was more important than the ongoing "special operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. Attempts by [[russian_political_analysis | Russian official media]] to compromise Prigozhin by exposing his luxurious lifestyle were ineffective, as "there is no negative PR" except an obituary, and Russian society has become "immune to exposure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

The speaker foresees significant [[russian_political_analysis | political events]] in Russia, possibly a coup d'état, with multiple groups vying for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. He encourages listeners to stay informed and connected via Telegram for "operational information" and guidance on future actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57] микрофон>.

Valery Solovy, in a program recorded on December 25th, 2022, discusses the perceived parallels and contrasts between the political and public relations strategies of Russian President [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Vladimir Putin]] and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The core argument is that [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] is increasingly copying Zelenskyy's approach, indicating a PR advantage for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Zelenskyy's PR Lead and Putin's Imitation

The speaker highlights several recent public appearances to illustrate the perceived imitation:
*   Zelenskyy visited Bakhmut, while [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] "allegedly" visited Rostov at the headquarters of the United Branches of the Armed Forces, though the speaker claims [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] was not actually there but met the military in another location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   Zelenskyy awarded fighters on the front line, whereas [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] held a small Kremlin meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   Zelenskyy met with US President Biden in the US Congress, while [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] met with the "alleged" President of [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Belarus]], Lukashenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The speaker notes that the person who briskly jumped off the plane in Minsk was a double of [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]], not the actual President, used to demonstrate excellent physical condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Even the "bread and salt" welcoming ceremony did not involve the real [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] due to "important circumstances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   Zelenskyy spoke before the US Congress, a speech during which half of the listeners reportedly fell asleep, even [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]]'s closest associates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] also came out to journalists and appeared on a TV show with a mini-interview, making a significant statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

The speaker concludes that Zelenskyy "completely outplays" [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] in PR terms, forcing [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] to respond to Zelenskyy's "image breakthrough" with similar PR actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The initiative in the foreign policy arena, where reputation and image are formed, now rests with the Ukrainian president, forcing [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]], who "deeply hates and despises" Zelenskyy, to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. The speaker asserts that "a copy is always worse than the original," leaving the audience to determine who is the real leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Military Preparations and Strategic Goals

Both parties are reportedly preparing for a "decisive battle" and concentrating forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Ukraine's Strategic Offensive
According to President Biden, Ukraine is expected to receive significant military aid from NATO countries and allies, including:
*   2,000 tanks and other armored vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
*   Over 800 artillery systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   Over 2 million shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>
*   More than 20 multiple launch rocket systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>

This arsenal is intended to enable Ukraine to launch a "strategic offensive" to reach its state borders with [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### [[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_strategy | Russia]]'s Counter-Strategy and Mobilization
[[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_strategy | Russia]]'s response includes:
*   **Attacks on Energy Infrastructure**: Striking Ukraine's energy system to de-energize the country, cause industrial disorganization, demoralize Ukrainian society, generate public pressure on Zelenskyy, and provoke a new wave of emigration towards European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Acquiring New Weapons**: [[putins_strategy_for_ukraine | Russia]] expects to receive new weapons systems from Iran, primarily ballistic missiles, with a first batch possibly transferred before the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This information comes from the head of Israeli Mossad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Mobilization**: [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | Russia]] is focusing on the mobilization and concentration of manpower to achieve a quantitative advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   A new mobilization is expected to follow soon after the New Year holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
    *   This will likely involve a partial or complete closure of borders for those in the mobilization base, which is presumed to contain about 7 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
    *   The goal is to mobilize 2 million people, including 300,000 women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
    *   Limited movement between subjects of the [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | Russian Federation]] may be imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
    *   Mobilized personnel will be sent almost immediately to the front line or line of contact without preliminary training due to a lack of organizational and technical capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
    *   While some will hide or attempt to leave [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | Russia]], widespread resistance is not expected; people will "resignedly" go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
    *   Yevgeny Prigozhin has proposed using prisoners from both male and female colonies, and even patients from neuropsychiatric dispensaries, to "wash away their guilt with blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. These individuals are reportedly needed for the creation of the "Surovikin line," a defensive fortification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
    *   After repelling the Ukrainian offensive, [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | Russia]] plans its own counteroffensive, potentially using the territory of the [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Republic of Belarus]] and other directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

## [[kremlins_diplomatic_strategies_with_ukraine and the_west | Kremlin's Diplomatic Strategies]] and Definition of Victory

The speaker discusses [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]]'s plans for a "victorious completion" of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   China's leadership, specifically "comrade Xi," set conditions for visiting Moscow or even telephone conversations with [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]], demanding that [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Russia]] provide a plan for completing the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This indicates that Beijing is capable of dictating terms to [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
*   [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]]'s message, in response to China, stated his confidence in achieving final victory "no later than mid-summer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   "Victory" for [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] apparently means the acquisition or control over new territories and then entering into peace negotiations, aiming for a truce, ceasefire, or even a peace treaty by mid-summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. The speaker views this as "extremely dubious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   China's stance towards [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | Russia]] is exemplified by China Cosco, the largest sea transportation operator, which has refused to transport oil from [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | Russia]] since December 5th, following the introduction of oil price caps and export restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This indicates China's willingness to treat the [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | Russian Federation]] as it pleases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

### Shifting Goals of the "Special Military Operation"
Initially, the goals of the operation were "demilitarization" and "denazification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] has partially claimed the demilitarization goal was achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

However, a new goal has emerged: the "unification of the [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Russian people]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. This objective aims to unite ethnic [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Russians]] living in countries like Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and the Baltic states with [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. The speaker sarcastically questions if these populations genuinely desire such unification, noting that many are fleeing [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. The speaker also emphasizes that [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] has a poor understanding of history, as Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians are distinct peoples, despite ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and historical ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. The speaker states that [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]]'s actions have caused any group sympathetic to [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | Russia]] to flee from it "like from a leper country," as [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | Russia]] brings "brotherly love with the help of missiles and artillery shells" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. This goal is deemed "fantastic," "counterproductive," and alarming to sovereign countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

The speaker concludes that [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] has pulled [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | Russia]] into a "strategic trap" called Ukraine, and everyone will have to pay the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. Despite the difficulties, the speaker encourages listeners that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.

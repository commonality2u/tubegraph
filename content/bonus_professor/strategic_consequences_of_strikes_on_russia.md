Strikes on Russian territory, particularly those using Western-supplied weapons, have become a significant development in the ongoing conflict, leading to various strategic implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Reasons for Increased Strikes

The possibility of these strikes, including on original Russian territory (excluding Crimea and "new territories"), has arisen due to a shift in Western perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. The West no longer perceives Crimea as sovereign Russian territory, which is why Ukrainian forces struck military and infrastructure facilities there earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

The fundamental reason for the increased allowance of strikes is the Western understanding that the "real" Putin is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. The West feared the previous leader due to his perceived clinical instability and willingness to risk a global conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. In contrast, the current ruling group is seen as more realistic, not desiring a thermonuclear war, and possessing internal limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

Consequently, American officials and Western allies express confidence that Russia is not preparing nuclear strikes, leading to reduced fears of escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. This perception has broadened the opportunities for Ukraine to use supplied weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

## Strategic Outcomes

While the massive use of Western weapons on Russian military and critical infrastructure will not lead to a strategic turning point in the conflict, nor will it result in Ukraine winning the military confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>:

*   **Weakened Offensive:** Strikes are capable of weakening Russia's offensive impulse and causing serious damage to its armed forces and logistics, especially if Russia is preparing for a new offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.
*   **Strategic Impasse:** The situation is likely to return to a strategic impasse around the turn of summer and autumn, similar to the one experienced in late autumn/September of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   **Incentive for Peace Talks:** Reaching a strategic impasse may incentivize a transition to direct peaceful consultations between Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Russia had previously made a peace offer through Western allies, which Ukraine rejected as unacceptable a month prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. However, perceptions of the situation might change by September on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   **Increased Readiness for Compromise:** Russia's readiness for a broad compromise may also increase significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

## Influence of Internal Russian Politics

The [[strategic_situation_of_the_russian_federation | internal political dynamics in Russia]] itself, particularly the ongoing power transition, could also influence Ukraine's readiness to engage in peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. If this transition unfolds in an unforeseen and destructive manner for the system, Ukraine's strategic position may change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

Overall, Russia is experiencing significant brewing events that will alter its development trajectory, impacting the country's fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

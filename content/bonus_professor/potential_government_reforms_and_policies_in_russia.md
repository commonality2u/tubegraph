This article outlines [[reforms_and_future_strategies_for_russias_governance_and_social_systems | potential changes]] in Russian governance and policies, based on insights from Valery Solovey's program "Answers to Hot Questions". Solovey emphasizes that he conveys plans and intentions, which are subject to unforeseen circumstances and variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Plans can be postponed or modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## General Outlook on Future Changes

The year 2025 is predicted to be harder for Russia than the current outgoing year, though 2026 is hoped to be easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. There is a basis for this hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. Radical [[sociopolitical_changes_and_reforms_in_russia | changes for the better]] are anticipated for the upcoming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>.

Solovey asserts that a future government will operate under a system of control designed to prevent officials from acting solely in their self-interest, ensuring actions benefit society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:14">[00:43:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:22">[00:43:22]</a>. This system aims to promote wealth growth alongside public welfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. The core of this system is a democratic structure with checks and balances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>.

## Political Transition and Leadership

There is ongoing speculation about a change of government and a new Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. While such plans were previously expected by the end of the current year, unforeseen circumstances have caused postponement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The leakage of information has played a role in blocking some undesirable plans, such as the potential appointment of Viktor Khmari as acting Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

Solovey affirms that there will be a clear truth revealed about what has happened in Russia and what was done by the "so-called Russian Elite" and "Russian leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. This truth will be communicated and made available to everyone with evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. Despite evidence, a significant portion of society may not believe it due to fear of thinking, as the truth can destroy their worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

### Influence of Elite Groups

The "Patrushev group" is noted for initiating a tirade of reprimands against Denis Manturov, who is a current focus of the "so-called Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The Patrushev group has a favorable relationship with the presidential security service, which supervises the double of President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

The "Chemezov's group" has been influential in preventing a new wave of mobilization and the use of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. They have also prevented other "extremely dangerous things" from occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. For example, the issue of using tactical nuclear weapons in March-April 2022 was blocked by "several brave, courageous people" at the cost of their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

## Economic Policies

The speaker expects an acceleration of price growth in the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.# Potential Government Reforms and Policies in Russia

## [[economic_challenges_and_reforms_in_russia | Economic Policies]]

The speaker expects an acceleration of price growth in the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### Currency and Inflation
*   Official statements on inflation accumulated over 3 years (2012-2015) claim 28-29%, but alternative calculations suggest it was no less than 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   The Central Bank management predicted a dollar exchange rate of 120 rubles by late autumn/early winter, and forecasts for next year suggest 150 rubles in the first half, not excluding 200 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
*   Citizens are advised to consider buying Euros if they have funds, as older US dollar bills are not accepted in some places like the Emirates or Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

### Deposit Freezing and Financial Restrictions
*   The idea of freezing investments to avoid economic challenges has been postponed until spring/summer but could be launched earlier depending on circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.
*   Exchange restrictive steps will likely be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   Conditions might be introduced under which deposits up to 1,400 rubles are not touched, potentially gaining public support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   There are currently no plans to forcibly transfer frozen Russian funds to the digital ruble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.
*   The speaker notes that while the government itself cannot cancel the circulation of older dollars, banks may refuse to accept them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:23">[00:44:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:25">[00:44:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>.
*   The government is not preparing to arrest and confiscate cryptocurrency because it widely uses it as a tool to circumvent sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:10">[00:48:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:13">[00:48:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:16">[00:48:16]</a>. All crypto transactions are recorded under the FSB's auspices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a>.

### Combating Fraud and Financial Crime
*   There is a 100% chance to strengthen the fight against fraudulent schemes, as those protecting them are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:59">[00:44:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>.
*   Experts believe that mass telephone fraud could be stopped within six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>.
*   Bookmakers are expected to survive any financial restrictions as they generate colossal profits and the government does not want to fight them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:49">[00:49:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:55">[00:49:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:58">[00:49:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>.

## Social Reforms

### [[potential_changes_in_russian_government_policies_and_pensions | Pensions and Social Security]]
*   After coming to power, the issue of returning to the previous retirement age and compensating those who did not receive their pension will be considered and likely implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:15">[00:27:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>.
*   A civilized society ensures pensioners do not receive meager pensions, especially in a country rich in natural resources, and provides social security comparable to Central European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.

### Education and Healthcare
*   Extensive, massive, and comprehensive actions will be taken to reform the education system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.
*   Changes for the better in education and healthcare systems are expected to take at least 10-15 years, but initial improvements could be felt within the first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.
*   Regarding toll roads and clinics, the speaker states nothing will happen to them, but there should always be a free, high-quality alternative available for public access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:38">[00:38:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.

### Truce with Ukraine
*   The "Kremlin towers" desire to end military actions against Ukraine, though the "power or Chekist tower" seeks more militant conditions than the "pragmatist and realist tower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   Plans for a truce with Ukraine remain in force, but their implementation terms can shift due to circumstances, such as the escalation of military actions in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   The American side, including a new administration, is sending signals to Russia that it will not tolerate delays in reaching a truce and is ready to use blackmail to force it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   A version claiming a deal between the USA and the Kremlin for Putin's metastasis in Syria in exchange for conquests in Ukraine is stated as 100% wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.
*   The speaker stated that the future of Mariupol is tied to the plans of the elected President Trump, which the Russian elite will have to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:12">[00:42:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.
*   There was a significant chance for Russia and Ukraine to have a more friendly, good-neighborly relationship, which depended more on Russia, but the Russian leadership (specifically a part of it) did not want to use this chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:30">[00:41:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>.

### Treatment of Foreign Nationals and Leaders
*   The speaker believes that figures like Bashar al-Assad, after a change of power in Russia, should be transferred to their own countries to face trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:59">[00:37:59]</a>. Russian citizens, however, will not be handed over to international courts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>.
*   The Kremlin needs Assad due to the significant amount of money involved, specifically 130 billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:45">[00:45:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. Yanukovych also paid billions for asylum in Russia, which were used to finance military operations in Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:58">[00:45:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>.

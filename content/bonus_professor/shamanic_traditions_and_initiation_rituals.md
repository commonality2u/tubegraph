The discussion with Andrey Valeryevich Kosmach, a leading Russian expert in occultism and magical practices, delves into the complexities of shamanic traditions, particularly focusing on their historical roots, initiation rituals, and their surprising intersection with modern Russian politics and elite circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Bon Religion and its Rituals

The Bon religion is considered one of the world's most complex and mysterious, with origins in the prehistoric period, making its study challenging due to a lack of written monuments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Two main versions exist:
*   **Historical Bon** (or "pain historically"): An indivisible and eternal fight practiced in Nepal, Tanya, and Western Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **New Bon** (or "new bor"): Adapted to Buddhism, sharing nothing in common with the eternal form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Many contemporary "ancient military practices" of the Bon religion in Nepal are picturesque, eclectic performances with elements of Gallic dance, Aryan cult of Tibetan dance, and animal sacrifices, often conducted by Buddhist monks, which are not authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Researchers offer varied interpretations, from shamanism with animism to a current within the cult of Kolya, and even Tibetan Satanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

For centuries, Bon was aggressively persecuted by "peace-loving" Buddhists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. In the 20th century, pseudo-studies emerged, aiming to depict Bon as bloody and cruel, but these studies lacked direct contact with Bon priests or authentic texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Authors like Nikolai Roerich, in his book "Altai Himalaya," even compared Bon to Christianity, concluding it was an "evil" and "negative phenomenon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Such conclusions were often based on Buddhist descriptions of rituals, like those conducted by the wandering monk Ja Lama for Baron Ungern, which had tragic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

The reality of the Bon religion is shrouded in a multi-stage veil of secrets, existing beyond the rational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Its temple complexes are located in hard-to-reach, natural labyrinthine caves in the Nepalese Himalayas, some hundreds of kilometers long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Andrey Kosmach is one of the few Russians who has witnessed authentic Bon rituals, which are complex and difficult to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. These practices can change the algorithm of fate and teach individuals to control events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The fundamental practice of Bon is achieving a state of non-duality, allowing a person to comprehend the secrets of being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Warrior priests believe that those who accidentally comprehend this knowledge use it for personal or societal harm, which is why Bon remains closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

### The Egregor Ritual Against Putin

On June 21, 2020, during a solar eclipse (137th Saros period), a ritual to create an "egregor" was performed in Corrigan Taxcom, Nepal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. An egregor is described as a non-material, complex energy substance capable of changing the trajectory of fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. This specific ritual targeted an individual whose fate is "directly connected with the fate of the entire post-Soviet space" – the President of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.

The idea embedded within the egregor determines its outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. Two key periods in its formation are crucial:
1.  **Central part formation**: Coincided with protests in Khabarovsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.
2.  **Maximum strength culmination (50th day)**: Coincided with elections in Belarus, which led to large-scale protests that cancelled the Kremlin's desired unification project between Russia and Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

Since August 9, 2020, it is observed that the "luck factor" has left the Russian leader, and "fortune turned its back on him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. Metaphysical practices can create serious fluctuations, awakening the masses, but real change requires the "free will of the mind sapiens" – people's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

The Federal Security Service (FSB) reportedly investigated this information and received full confirmation from lamas in Balkhash that the ritual was indeed carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. However, these lamas stated that the final effect of these rituals is irreversible by Tibetan Buddhism, as they lack crucial, carefully guarded details of Bon practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

## Shamanism in Russia and the Elite

### The Problem of Authenticity
The discussion shifts to [[shamanic_rituals_and_political_influence | Siberian shamans]], particularly given reports of the Russian president consulting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. A key challenge is confirming the authenticity of shamans and their initiation, as many traditions have been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. Most self-proclaimed shamans in Russia are considered impostors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.

### Shamanic Initiation Rituals
Shamanism is formed within a dualistic worldview that divides the world into "everyday" and "sacred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. While common features exist across continents, distinctive features, especially in the rite of initiation, significantly dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. In Russia, the algorithm for initiation was largely lost due to "ruthless and merciless struggle" against it during the Soviet period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. Historians' enthusiasm helped preserve some algorithms and rituals, but much scientific research was lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>.

The genuine rite of initiation typically involves:
*   **Shamanic gift**: Passed on by inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.
*   **Chosenness by spirits**: Spirits mentally encourage the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.
*   **Shamanic disease**: A special condition manifested in childhood, emphasizing chosenness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>.
*   **Formation**: The future shaman studies and learns the world under an experienced shaman for 7 to 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
*   **Clan Council**: Recognizes the initiate's right to be a shaman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.
*   **Ceremony**:
    *   Takes place over several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
    *   Opened by a shaman mentor who instills a specific spirit to determine the rite's correctness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. Only a "shaman with a crown and a cane" can instill this spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.
    *   The initiate approaches the mentor, who then leads the rite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:11">[00:27:11]</a>.
    *   Ablution and preparation of an elixir from hallucinogenic mushrooms or other plants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.
    *   Purification by smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.
    *   Slaughter of a sacrificial animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.
    *   Presentation of shamanic attributes: a crown with horns, staff, whip, tambourine beater, and ritual costume made of animal skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
    *   The young shaman independently calls on spirits for strength and blessing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.
    *   Culmination: Vision of ancestor spirits within the shaman's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.
    *   The initiation lasts until the shaman introduces a certain number of spirits into their body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.
    *   Completion is determined by the vision of the original spirit that opened the ceremony, indicating the ritual's quality and revealing hidden knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.
    *   Followed by another ablution and blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

Modern vulgarization has led to a significant simplification of shamanism's theory and practice, with previously unacceptable methods now used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:48">[00:29:48]</a>. Knowledge of shamanism in Russia is fragmented, leading to more versions and hypotheses than answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

### Historical Theory of Repression and Shamanism in Politics
One theory suggests that the harsh repressive measures against shamanic communities in young Soviet Russia stemmed from an incident involving Joseph Stalin (then Vissarion Dzhugashvili) during his exile in Turukhansk in 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. According to a provincial police report, Dzhugashvili intervened in a clan council dispute between a shaman and an Evenki prince, siding with the prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. An "unpleasant incident" followed with the shaman, after which Dzhugashvili was transferred to another village <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:55">[00:31:55]</a>.

The Russian government itself believes in shamans as protectors and consults them on various issues, including pension reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. However, since many contemporary shamans are imposters, this reliance is described as a "placebo effect" or "group psychotherapy," where the authorities self-deceive into believing they have support from higher powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. Shamans become instruments for legitimizing their power claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. This governmental trend leads other societal representatives to actively integrate shamanism into their lives, even in "comic phantasmagoric options" like calling a shaman for a court verdict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>.

## Ayahuasca and the Russian Elite

A widespread fashion among the Russian establishment, migrating to the middle class, involves traveling to the Amazon in search of local shamans and out-of-body journeys via "ayahuasca" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>. This trend has reached the "upper layer of the Russian elite," including the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>. However, what is consumed by these individuals is often not authentic ayahuasca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.

According to mythological concepts, ayahuasca is a "gift from the gods" meant only for those to whom it was intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>. Revealing its secrets to strangers risks angering the gods, bringing diseases and difficulties upon the tribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. Despite this, the temptation of money leads many tribes to offer "solvent pilgrims" a complex decoction that mimics the hallucinogenic effect of authentic ayahuasca but is not the true substance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>.

Authentic ayahuasca consists of only two components: a liana (containing harmin and cha coffin) and another plant (containing dimethyltryptamine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. Its preparation takes many hours during daylight, and it is consumed after sunset during special, infrequent ceremonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>. Other times, a "variation method" with over 30 components is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>.

The crucial element is not the recipe but the *sequence* of the ritual, which consists of three main stages, unknown to the Russian "pseudo-elite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>. Before and after the main ceremony, participants receive entheogens – plant-based products influencing the psyche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>. The first alkaloid resets consciousness and prepares for a full trance, preventing psychodynamic and abstract mixtures of new experiences and memories ("walking through the evening fog") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>. Only after this state is cleared is ayahuasca used, initiating a "full-fledged transpersonal trip" lasting 4-6 hours, where space and time boundaries disappear, and a journey within oneself and the universe begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>. Afterward, another entheogen allows the spirit to return to the body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.

Wealthy pilgrims seeking "healing and other benefits" typically experience a commercialized, inauthentic ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. For instance, in the Colombian Amazon, pilgrims fly by private helicopter to an "extreme platform," then take a boat to a specially built "ethnographic village" that is otherwise unused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>. They are greeted by "inhabitants" (actors), inspect "tropical attractions," and in the evening, drink a concoction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>. This provides a "very high-quality hallucinosis" created by the brain, leading to a feeling of satisfaction but no true spiritual contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

Some advanced Russian elites consider these Amazonian rituals "atavism" and prefer "reptiloid flights to Nibiru" or connecting with Sirius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>. These "advanced" individuals use a wide range of hallucinogenic colloids, from exotic Colorado toad secretions mixed with dimethyltryptamine to lysergic acid from ergot or psilocybin mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>.

Touring "shamans" who visit Russia and Ukraine are largely charlatans engaged in a "commercial project" to monetize the demand from rich, naive individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:12">[01:05:12]</a>. They are instructed on what to say through translators to meet the client's expectations, providing a form of "psychotherapy" that costs "hundreds of thousands of dollars" to "half a million dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>. Ultimately, these sessions lead to "nothing happens except for the process of calming down," serving as a placebo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

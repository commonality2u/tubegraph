Valery Solovey's 47th episode, recorded on January 8th and aired on January 9th, focuses on the strategic situation of the Russian Federation and its president, Vladimir Putin, asserting that Putin himself created this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The episode provides a [[military_and_political_analysis | military and political analysis]] of the current state of affairs, framing it within the concept of a "strategic trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Understanding a Strategic Trap

A strategic trap is defined by two key features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>:
1.  **Fundamental Inability to Achieve Goals** The primary characteristic is the fundamental inability of one party in a conflict to achieve its military-political goals through military means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
2.  **Continued Escalation** Despite this fundamental inability, the party continues to increase efforts to achieve these "obviously unattainable" goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

This term is applicable beyond military art, extending to business and other fields where strategy is employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Historical and Current Examples

Historically, superpowers have fallen into strategic traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>:
*   The United States in Vietnam (1965-1973) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, and Afghanistan (2001-2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   The Soviet Union in Afghanistan (1979-1989) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   Modern Russia in Ukraine is currently in a strategic trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

These situations historically ended with withdrawal and political defeat, even if not always direct military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. They also led to the colossal and inept waste of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Reasons for Falling into Strategic Traps

Countries (and even corporations) fall into strategic traps due to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>:
*   **Overestimation of Own Power** The party initiating the conflict overestimates its own economic and military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Underestimation of Enemy Strength** There is an underestimation of the enemy's military power and the ability of civilians to provide sustained resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Misunderstanding of Theater of Operations** The party with the initiative fails to grasp the unique significance and specifics of the military operational theater, such as the jungles of Vietnam or the mountainous terrain of Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Error in Assessing Strategic Context** Crucially, there is an underestimation or error in assessing the broader strategic context. Historically, this involves the intervention of other superpowers providing assistance to the opposing side (e.g., Soviet Union and China aiding North Vietnam; the West aiding Afghanistan against the Soviets; the West aiding Ukraine against Russia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Russian propaganda correctly notes that the West is against Russia, primarily as a supplier of equipment, intelligence, and even manpower via Western PMCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Reasons for Persisting in Strategic Traps

Despite predictions of danger, countries persist in these situations due to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>:
1.  **Arrogance of Power** A belief that the superior economic and military potential of one side will eventually prevail. This "arrogance of power" is characteristic of superpowers, including the United States in Vietnam and Afghanistan, the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, and the Russian Federation in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
2.  **Cognitive Delusion** Like a casino player who constantly increases stakes to recoup losses, military-political leadership can fall into cognitive delusion. Examples include Defense Secretary McNamara's push for increased U.S. military presence in Vietnam and Russia's "energy war" against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This applies to businesses that continue to invest in losing projects, unwilling to "fix losses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
3.  **Distorting Properties of Religion or Ideology** While not typical for the U.S. or Soviet Union (though ideology played a role), this factor was evident in the Iran-Iraq War, driven by Iran's "passionate heated ideology of the victorious Islamic revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## The Role of Power and Political Systems

Cognitive delusions affect all people and systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. However, only countries possessing colossal economic and military potential—superpowers like the United States or the Soviet Union—or those with a fervent ideology (like Iran) can afford to persist in such delusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

Smaller, economically developed countries, lacking such resource potential, are quickly forced to abandon conflicts and seek reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This highlights an advantage of democratic systems: competition and criticism compel leaders to react faster to resource depletion, as they face elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

Conversely, authoritarian leaders tend to persist longer in conflicts because losing or withdrawing on terms they perceive as dishonorable threatens their political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

## Russia's Situation and Future Outlook

Russia is currently in a strategic trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Unlike previous superpowers, Russia is not a superpower given its GDP share of 1.7% globally, compared to the U.S. (23%) and the European Union (17%), plus contributions from Japan and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This colossal incomparability of economic and military potentials means Russia cannot talk about victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

An opportunity for an honorable withdrawal from Ukraine was missed in March 2022, when conditions were ideal and the Ukrainian leadership was open to concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. Now, neither the Ukrainian leadership nor society will make concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

The situation for the Russian Federation and its leadership is expected to worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. To preserve his power and achieve an "honorable exit" presented as a victory, Putin is willing to use any means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. His primary resource is manpower, as there is a clear shortage of shells and modern weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>. He believes Russia's human potential significantly exceeds Ukraine's and is prepared to accept losses of up to half a million people, according to "evil but very informed tongues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. The Russian Ministry of Defense's reporting on losses is unreliable, often exaggerating Ukrainian casualties to impossible levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. This illustrates the [[influence_of_media_and_public_perception_during_conflict | influence of media and public perception during conflict]].

Ultimately, the goals of the "special operation" are now internal to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. For Putin, the main goal is self-preservation of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. However, this strategy paradoxically weakens his power daily, as those around him and in Russian society recognize that something is wrong and they are caught in a trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

Quoting Miyamoto Musashi's "The Book of Five Rings," Solovey concludes that "immature strategy [is] the reason for sadness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. This "immature strategy" characterizes the Russian government and will bring intensified sadness for the country and its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. The year ahead is predicted to be much more difficult, but with a chance to decisively influence their destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

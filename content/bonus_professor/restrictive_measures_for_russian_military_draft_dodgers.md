On April 11, a significant [[legal_amendments_concerning_military_mobilization_in_russia | legal event]] occurred in Russia, marking a formal step in legislating the legal consequences of [[potential_mobilization_and_military_service_changes_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. These changes relate to amendments to the unified register of persons liable for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This development comes as a campaign to recruit contract soldiers into the Russian armed forces appears to be failing, particularly in large cities like Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, suggesting a potential need for mobilization to compensate for anticipated losses from a Ukrainian counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Electronic Summonses and Automatic Receipt

Electronic summonses are now legally equivalent to paper ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. A summons is considered automatically received the moment it is posted in the personal account of a person liable for military service on public services platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This applies to all persons liable for military service, not just conscripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The rule clarifies that it does not apply to the spring draft, but rather to [[potential_mobilization_and_military_service_changes_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Expanding Restrictive Measures for Draft Dodgers

[[legal_restrictions_related_to_military_service | Restrictive measures]] for draft dodgers are being expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. These penalties will affect all individuals liable for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. If a person does not appear voluntarily within two weeks after receiving a summons (which is digitally signed by the military commissar), a number of [[current_and_potential_future_restrictions_in_russia | restrictions]] are introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>:

*   **Exit Ban** Individuals will be prohibited from leaving the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Additional Restrictions (after 20 days)** If a person still does not appear after 20 days (though this timeframe may not be strictly observed), further [[current_and_potential_future_restrictions_in_russia | restrictions]] are imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>:
    *   Prohibition from driving vehicles; driving licenses are formally canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   Inability to conclude real estate transactions (buying or selling apartments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   Inability to register as an individual entrepreneur (and likely engage in economic activity as one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   Ban on taking out loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   Anticipated blocking of bank accounts, even if not explicitly stated in current amendments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

These [[repressive_laws_and_implications_for_russian_society | restrictive measures]] are intended to compel those who receive summonses to appear for military service and fulfill their civic and patriotic duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The changes could potentially affect more than 20 million citizens, with estimates of up to 27 million people potentially mobilizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Advice for Citizens

Individuals are advised to consider their personal circumstances and duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. For those prioritizing family and personal safety over military service in a foreign country, several steps are suggested:

*   **Stay Calm** Do not panic, as there is still some time, possibly until the May holidays, to take meaningful action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Manage Public Services Accounts** Consider whether a public services account is necessary, as electronic summonses are sent there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   **Consult Legal Professionals** General powers of attorney are unlikely to protect assets from these new restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. If considering transferring rights to property or vehicles, consult with good lawyers to understand the risks, as some [[legal_restrictions_related_to_military_service | legal consequences]] can be irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Prepare and Plan** Develop a plan, or multiple options, for what to do if a critical decision regarding mobilization is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Discuss these options with family and friends, and consider agreeing on mutual assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

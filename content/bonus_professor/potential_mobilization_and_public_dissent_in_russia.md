On March 4th, 2022, discussions highlighted the increasing pressure on the Russian populace due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the resulting sanctions. The conversation points to a future where [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] and widespread [[public_dissatisfaction_and_political_implications_in_russia | public dissatisfaction]] could become significant factors.

## [[possibility_of_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | Threat of Mobilization and Martial Law]]

Estimates suggest that Russia is currently utilizing 90% of the forces initially selected for the conflict in Ukraine, indicating a depletion of reserves [02:02:05]. This situation leads to the expectation of a need for new reserves [02:11:11]. It is anticipated that the government may introduce [[possibility_of_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]], either fully or partially, which would justify [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | mobilizing]] citizens [02:02:54].

A strategy considered is to engage the growing number of unemployed individuals by assigning them to military service or labor armies [02:11:16]. For those with military experience, a contract might be offered, while those without could be assigned to rear-echelon roles [02:11:29]. There are also rumors of raids being conducted in major cities like Moscow, targeting young people for conscription [02:33:59]. It is believed that a [[threat_of_a_second_wave_of_mobilization_in_russia | large-scale mobilization]] affecting hundreds of thousands of people would be highly noticeable to the public [02:33:51].

## Economic Hardship and [[public_dissatisfaction_and_political_implications_in_russia | Public Dissatisfaction]]

The West's sanctions are viewed as an "economic war" against Russia [02:27:31]. This has led to an immediate impact on the economy, with banks raising deposit rates significantly, suggesting an expectation of much higher inflation, potentially 50-60% [02:02:00]. It is predicted that the Russian people will fully experience the effects of these sanctions, reminiscent of the 1990s, by late summer or earlier if the military situation escalates [02:20:23].

Anticipated economic consequences include:
*   Mass unemployment, with the possibility of introducing labor service [02:14:27].
*   The reintroduction of a distributive economy and elements of "rationing" [02:14:38].
*   Shortages of food, interruptions in logistics, and serious problems with the provision of imported medicines and medical consumables [02:14:49]. This could lead to a severe decline in healthcare quality [02:16:05].
*   A general return to the concept of "deficit," where people will learn that essential goods are simply unavailable, not just expensive [02:16:39].

## Public Reaction and Information Control

Currently, state propaganda appears to be effective in shaping public opinion, with many people not wanting to acknowledge or hear about the dire realities [02:26:23]. There is skepticism regarding official polls claiming high levels of support for the conflict, as people are likely to give socially approved answers [02:26:30].

The government is actively working to suppress alternative information channels. Independent media outlets, which previously offered an alternative viewpoint, have been effectively eliminated [02:12:00]. Efforts are underway to block social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, with YouTube also expected to be blocked soon [02:36:11]. The government aims to make it impossible for people to consolidate on the street or organize [[public_engagement_and_activism_in_russias_political_landscape | protests]] [02:13:35].

Regarding casualties, official figures greatly diverge from Ukrainian estimates [02:28:39]. While direct awareness of war deaths might not immediately trigger widespread outrage, the government has a strategy to manage public reaction. Putin has announced significant compensation for the families of the dead (7.5 million rubles) and wounded (3 million rubles) [02:32:23]. This financial incentive is seen as a way to "shut up" many people, despite potential bureaucratic hurdles or classification of deaths as non-combat related [02:33:00].

## [[social_unrest_and_potential_for_protest_in_russia | Suppression of Dissent and Future Repressions]]

Beyond information control, there are signs of increased restrictions on movement. People are reportedly being questioned at airports by FSB operatives, with inquiries about their reasons for leaving and checks of their phones for social media activity [02:38:12]. An outright ban on leaving the country is anticipated, especially for conscripts, possibly through the reintroduction of exit visas and interviews [02:38:09, 02:42:09]. Already, a significant number of draft-age, intelligent young men are attempting to leave Russia [02:40:29].

The focus of repression is expected to shift from political leaders, who are largely neutralized, to broader segments of society [02:46:21]. Initially targeting "disloyal" individuals such as bloggers and cultural figures, repression will expand to "mass groups" once their [[russian_societal_change_and_public_dissatisfaction | dissatisfaction]] becomes apparent [02:47:43]. This includes intimidating ordinary citizens for minor acts of dissent, such as a joke or a critical comment [02:48:20]. The goal is to enforce "total loyalty" through periodic, arbitrary purges and punishments to prevent any form of uprising [02:49:42]. This approach reflects a mix of old Russian and Soviet-era practices [02:50:51].

The overall situation is described as a "hell" created by the actions of one person [02:10:31]. While individual factors might not immediately trigger widespread [[social_unrest_and_potential_for_protest_in_russia | social unrest]], the totality of economic collapse, war losses, and escalating repression is expected to lead to significant societal upheaval [02:41:41].

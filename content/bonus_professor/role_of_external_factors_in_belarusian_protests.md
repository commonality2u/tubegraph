The ongoing [[political_unrest_and_revolution_in_belarus | political unrest and revolution in Belarus]] involves significant external influences, though their precise roles and impacts are subjects of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## International Recognition of Elections
Many [[international_reactions_to_belarus_election_results | European countries]], including Ukraine, have officially refused to recognize the results of the presidential elections in Belarus and did not congratulate Lukashenko on his victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Russia's Influence and Proposed Compromise
A key external factor is the role of [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | Russia]]. A compromise formula regarding Lukashenko's future was reportedly discussed during telephone conversations between Putin and Lukashenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This proposed compromise includes:
*   Lukashenko remaining President of Belarus for no more than a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Announcing early presidential elections after a new constitution is adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   Signing a new union treaty with Russia during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Lukashenko not participating in early elections, with Babariko potentially becoming the next president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Russia gaining control over Belarus, and Lukashenko potentially moving to Moscow to become secretary of a new body, the State Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Putin's statement about Russia preparing reserves to assist Lukashenko is seen as a tactic to compel the Belarusian opposition and society to negotiate a compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. However, the speaker notes that neither Putin nor Lukashenko desires the actual use of force, as it would severely damage relations between Russians and Belarusians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Putin had previously assured Merkel that Russia would not introduce armed forces into Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. The "reserve" mentioned refers to forces like the "Rose Guard and OMON," with about 200-300 members, including former Ukrainian Berkut fighters, already present in Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

If Lukashenko becomes an insurmountable obstacle to [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russian control over Belarus]], he could face severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. If a union treaty is signed, Belarus would lose 95% of its national powers to the union state, effectively becoming a "western province of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Other External Actors
Lukashenko himself attributes the rallies to an external factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. While there is an external factor, it is considered not to be of primary importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. A group of American consultants specializing in political technologies in Warsaw is attempting to assist the opposition, but their influence is not decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The unrest is not considered a revolution provoked from the outside, akin to how the "Revolution of Dignity" was not solely instigated by Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The European Union, in fact, had sought a compromise with Yanukovych in February 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

Ultimately, while external intervention exists, it is not deemed the key factor in the dynamics of events; if any external entity has a decisive impact, it is the [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

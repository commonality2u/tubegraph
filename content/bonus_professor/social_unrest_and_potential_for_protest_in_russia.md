The current situation in Russia is causing significant public dissatisfaction and a growing potential for unrest and protest, particularly exacerbated by the economic fallout and management of the pandemic.

## Growing Public Dissatisfaction
Public dissatisfaction with the authorities is increasing, with criticism coming "from the right and from the left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. A group close to the leader hopes for a miraculous return to a "quiet harbor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, but the situation is "starting to worry seriously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

A small group is described as being "welded together by one chain and tied by common blood," indicating they "have nowhere to go," akin to the German saying, "together went together to hang" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Mikhail Delyagin publicly called the Russian "power" "female able gangs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, reflecting a strong shift in rhetoric within communities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The speaker suggests that knowing the full truth about who ruled Russia and how "can seriously damage the psyche" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Public Opinion on the Epidemic
According to survey data, Russian citizens are divided into three approximate groups regarding the epidemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>:
*   **30%** believe authorities are "hiding the true picture" and "underestimating the data" of infected and deceased individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. The speaker is part of this group, knowing that the government "is hiding the scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.
*   **29%** (the "military hole") believe the official data is "correct and reliable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **28%** believe the threat from the virus is being "used by the authorities to cover up... their some kind of sins and affairs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>, including the situation with OPEC Plus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

The number of people approving of self-isolation decreased by 10% in the last week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. Political analysts suggest that current sociology is "very alarming for the authorities" due to negative moods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>, making holding a plebiscite or elections in the fall potentially "suicidal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

### Economic Hardship
Many Russians face severe financial difficulties:
*   60% to 65% of Russian families "did not have enough money even for a month" of self-isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.
*   The speaker cannot imagine how people will endure "another month of self-isolation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.
*   Unemployment is rising rapidly, with "half a million unemployed in Moscow" not even counting migrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.
*   The **[[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_russia | economic situation]]** is expected to worsen significantly by fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>, becoming "very serious" with "unemployment, and ... very serious unpleasant things will happen with the financial and banking sector" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.
*   The government's offer of 6.5% mortgages is questioned, as banks may not comply, demonstrating a lack of functional "vertical of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Banks rebuffed the Economic Development Minister's attempt to get interest-free loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   Campaigns trying to show government support for businesses are seen as attempts to "steal money" and will cause "the strongest irritation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>. The question from the audience regarding billboards promoting staying home is: "with what money are you sitting?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

## Government Actions and Public Perception
The government's actions are described as humiliating people and taking from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. While the US government provided $1200 to citizens, Russia's assistance to businesses for registered employees is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

The widely announced pass system in Moscow led to "queues at the entrance to the metro" and "traffic jams on the roads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, indicating poor management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. The mayor of Moscow "does not understand at all how life is arranged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The chaos surrounding the pass system highlighted a "vivid demonstration of his management talents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

The speaker believes that the authorities only know how to "beat[ing] on the head with truncheons" and "prohibiting and taking bribes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, but cannot "give" or "build a system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Police violence, a constant in Russia, has taken on a "particularly cynical" character against the current background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>.

An unspoken order for Moscow to exit the self-isolation regime despite the severe epidemic situation is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>, suggesting a de facto end to quarantine by May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

## Potential for Protest
There is a division among observers regarding the immediate potential for mass protests:
*   Some believe society will "explode in May" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.
*   However, others, including the speaker, disagree, stating that society, "despite the sharp increase in aggressiveness, irritation, is not yet ready for mass demonstrations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. Local conflicts and deviant behavior are expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>.
*   The "scared people" and deserted metro in Moscow show that the initial fear of the virus "worked" as a "strong restraining factor" for mass protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:59">[00:40:59]</a>.

Despite this, the speaker believes that the "nerve... will not explode" in May but expects "problems in the fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. The call for people to survive on minimal means is seen as potentially insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

The **[[possibility_and_consequences_of_revolution_or_unrest_in_russia | turning point in national consciousness]]** is described as happening quickly when it does occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>.

### Political Reform and Future Outlook
Rumors suggest that the Kremlin is preparing a "block of political reforms," including the "intention to cancel gubernatorial elections starting this fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a> and removing about 20 governors, some of whom "will go straight to prison" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>. This information is considered to correspond to reality, as holding elections in September is "extremely risky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. Instead, there's discussion about transferring gubernatorial elections to legislative assemblies or involving public representatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>.

The opposition's agenda is seen as "very simple": "the resignation of the president and government and the formation of the government national saved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. This will need to be achieved "on the streets and squares," not through elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. A letter from Moscow municipal deputies, which the speaker participates in, echoes these demands, stating that if the president and government cannot provide for society and business, "they must resign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:15">[00:44:15]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that the current situation is "a question of our physical existence" and that "our fate will depend solely on our actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>. The "question of survival is really on the agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>.

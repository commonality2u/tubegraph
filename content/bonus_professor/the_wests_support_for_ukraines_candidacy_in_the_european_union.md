## Symbolic Significance

The granting of candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova for membership in the European Union was deemed the most important political symbolic event in international politics of the week of June 27, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. While there is a significant distance to cover between candidate status and full acceptance, potentially requiring "not just years but ten years," and no guarantee of reaching the final stage, this gesture nonetheless signifies the West's symbolic readiness to support Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This readiness was also confirmed during the meeting of the Big Seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Changing Civilizational Vector

Beyond its political implications, the granting of candidate status carries a "symbolic historical-cultural and even civilizational" aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. It signifies that Ukraine and Ukrainian society have shifted their "civilizational Vector" from the Russian world towards the West, specifically Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This change was influenced by the actions of the Russian Federation, particularly President Putin, who "literally pushed Ukraine out of the potential embrace of the Russian world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This marks a departure from Ukraine's developmental vector of the past several hundred years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Beyond Candidacy: Military and Political Aid

The immediate concern is not how soon Ukraine will become an EU member, as this is not expected to happen quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Instead, the critical issue is how quickly, qualitatively, and in what amounts the West will provide [[international_military_assistance_to_Ukraine | military]] and political assistance and support to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This assistance is being provided even by Germany, which has been observed to "shirk military aid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

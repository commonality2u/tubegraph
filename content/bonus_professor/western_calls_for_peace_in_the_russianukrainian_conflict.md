Throughout December, there have been increasing [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | calls for peace]] from Western nations regarding the ongoing [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russian-Ukrainian conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. These proposals often suggest a return to the situation that existed before Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Key Proposals and Positions

Several prominent Western figures and institutions have voiced similar [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | proposals]]:
*   **US Secretary of State Antony Blinken:** Suggested that the warring parties should return to the situation as of the morning of February 24, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This implies Russia's refusal of newly occupied territories but not necessarily a refusal of Crimea or the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson:** Reportedly echoed similar sentiments to Blinken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Henry Kissinger:** In an article published in a respectable conservative British publication, the 99-year-old diplomat proposed a solution for the [[discussion_on_russian__ukrainian_relations_and_conflict_resolution | Russian-Ukrainian confrontation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. His suggestion was to return to the *status quo ante bellum* (the situation preceding the military actions) and then begin [[ukraine_russia_peace_talks_and_territorial_integrity | discussions on the status of Crimea]] and potentially the Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Kissinger's aim, shared by others, is to keep Russia engaged in Europe, inflict a military defeat without provoking a feeling of revanchism within the Russian leadership or society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

These [[consultations_and_proposals_for_resolving_the_ukraine_conflict | peace plans]] are said to be guided by historical experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Blinken acts as an active politician, while Kissinger retains intellectual influence, and Johnson represents the opinion of conservative circles in Great Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Reasons for Western [[prospects_for_ending_the_russiaukraine_conflict | Peace Initiatives]]

The push for [[proposal_for_peace_deal_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace deals]] is driven by several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>:
*   **Uncertainty of Military Actions:** There is a "fog of war," meaning victory is not guaranteed for either side, and the outcome remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Risk of Nuclear Escalation:** The possibility of nuclear escalation is unfortunately not zero, which is a serious concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Demographic and Economic Pressure on Europe:** Russia's energy war is increasing demographic pressure on Europe through immigration from Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. European nations are also suffering economic and financial losses due to the protracted conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Fear of Russian Destabilization:** There is a significant concern that a crushing military defeat of the Russian Federation, while not excluded, could lead to very serious political consequences and destabilization within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Such destabilization could pose no less danger to Europe and the global order than a crushing Russian victory over Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   **Risk-Benefit Analysis:** Some forces within the Western establishment prefer not to push matters to extremes, as the perceived risks significantly outweigh the potential benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## Sanctions and Russian Oligarchy

The Russian oligarchy appears to have been "squeezed" by sanctions, prompting some to decide to impose sanctions on themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. As of yesterday, the USA included practically all main figures in these sanctions lists, including Usmanov and Mordashov, who are part of Putin's inner circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

However, some oligarchs of the "old school" from the Yeltsin era, like Abramovich, have been given some leeway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. American sanctions on Usmanov, for instance, are not freezing all his assets, suggesting an opportunity for these individuals to "decide the issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Abramovich, not formally sanctioned, has reportedly been involved in attempts to establish negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv, which is seen as a way to avoid sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

There is a "differentiated approach" to oligarchs:
*   **"Seasoned" or "hyenas"**: Figures like Timchenko, Rotenberg, and Kovalchuk face merciless sanctions from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Putin reportedly takes "huge aesthetic emotional pleasure" from seeing these beneficiaries of his regime "writhe in agony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This "Group 1" is essentially "crossed out" by the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   **Those with leeway**: Oligarchs like Usmanov and Abramovich, who are offered more lenient regimes, are being encouraged to engage with Russia, particularly concerning Putin and the war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Abramovich has pledged charitable assistance to Ukraine, intending to transfer money from the sale of British assets to a recovery fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Despite their wealth, these oligarchs are politically helpless and cannot influence Putin or the generals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. For the last two years, none of them have been close to the president, who now communicates with a very limited number of people, primarily from the "first category" of citizens like Kovalchuk, Rotenberg, and Demchenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

The West's strategy is to increase pressure on oligarchs, and subsequently, officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. Sanctions are expected to spread "both in breadth and in depth," capturing new groups and involving family relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

## Impact on Russian Society and Economy

The current situation is defined as an "economic war" by Western policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>. Putin understands this and is preparing an "asymmetric response," which includes putting nuclear forces on high alert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>. European anti-missile ships are now on duty in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and Black Seas to intercept missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

Economic hardship is expected to become more severe:
*   **Unemployment**: Mass unemployment is anticipated, potentially leading to the introduction of labor service or "labor armies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   **Shortages**: Problems with logistics, provision of medicines, and imports are predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. The current generation will "learn what a deficit is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.
*   **Inflation**: Banks have raised deposit rates, but an annual interest rate of 21% on ruble deposits suggests an anticipated inflation rate of 50-60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.
*   **Daily Life**: People will face challenges in obtaining basic goods and medical care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

The population has not yet fully "felt" the consequences of the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. Propaganda is currently effective, with official polls showing high support, but these figures are questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. It is believed that "time works rather for those who are against than for those who are for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.

## Military Campaign and Repression

The current military campaign in Ukraine has used 90% of Russia's selected forces, indicating a depletion of reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. This situation could lead to the introduction of martial law and mass mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. Mobilization, especially of "hundreds of thousands of people," is expected to have a more significant impact on society than current losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

Regarding casualties, figures voiced in Ukraine and Russia "diverge at least 20 times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>. The government attempts to hide losses, offering compensation for dead and wounded soldiers, which is seen as a way to silence families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Suppression of dissent
> All alternative media channels have been destroyed, making it impossible for public opinion leaders or opposition figures like Navalny to organize protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>. The state also intends to block YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.

The regime will likely target not only "disloyal leaders" but also "mass groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:15]</a>. Repressions will be "blind," aiming to "intimidate the mass layers" for "total loyalty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. This includes persecuting those who refuse to "glorify great feats" of the ruler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:33">[00:47:33]</a>.

## Travel Restrictions and Future Outlook

A ban on leaving the country is anticipated, especially for conscripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>. People are already being questioned at airports, with FSB operatives checking phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>. This could lead to the introduction of "exit visas" and interviews for those wishing to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. Many young, intelligent people are currently trying to leave Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.

The [[ukraine_russia_conflict_and_strategic_turning_points | Ukraine Russia conflict]] is believed to follow an "occult" rather than rational program, with calculations made by astrologers and specialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:24">[00:52:24]</a>. It is predicted that the period until August will be "very scary," with the situation getting "worse and worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:54:53]</a>.

The combined effect of military losses, economic hardship, mobilization, and repression is expected to create a critical environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.

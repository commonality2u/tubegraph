Valery Solovey presented the 10th episode of "Answers to Hot Questions" on January 11, to be broadcast on January 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.

## Responsibility for Current Events
Valery Solovey states he does not share the concept of collective guilt or collective responsibility for what is happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>. He adheres to the view that "every mistake has a last name, first name and patronymic," emphasizing that each crime and criminal will be held personally accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:12">[01:52:12]</a>.

## Political Crisis in Russia
A political crisis in [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_international_relations | Russia]] is considered inevitable this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:25">[03:25:25]</a>, with the most likely course being in the form of unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:43">[03:43:43]</a>. While an order to fire to kill might be given, it is likely to be blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Security forces are not expected to side with protesters, at best remaining neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:06">[04:06:06]</a>.

## [[russian_military_operations_in_ukraine | Russia-Ukraine Conflict]]
### Putin's Decisions
According to the speaker, President Putin has a choice between "bad, very bad, and unbearable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:05">[05:05:05]</a>.
*   **Unbearable:** Attempting to use tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:11">[05:11:11]</a>.
*   **Very bad:** Continuing the [[russian_military_actions_in_ukraine | special military operation]] with unsuccessful hopes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:16">[05:16:16]</a>.
*   **Bad:** Admitting the "adventure" has failed, declaring a unilateral ceasefire, and being ready for peace talks without preconditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:22">[05:22:22]</a>.

Putin possesses a staff of excellent analysts, mainly at the Security Council, who have accurately predicted the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:46">[05:46:46]</a>. However, Putin "categorically does not like" and does not share their analytical assessments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:03">[06:03:03]</a>. He is attempting to "turn the tide of history" through his "senile weakening will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:08">[06:08:08]</a>.

### Mobilization and Travel Restrictions
A second wave of mobilization is beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:47">[09:47:47]</a>. Currently, 8 million Russian citizens are prohibited from crossing the border due to being in a database of debtors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:04">[10:04:04]</a>. These individuals are expected to be the first to receive summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:24">[10:24:24]</a>. This database will be supplemented by conscripts, potentially adding another 7-8 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:31">[10:31:31]</a>, bringing the total to potentially 15 to 20 million people forbidden from leaving the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:49">[10:49:49]</a>. On January 10, reports emerged that an additional 4 million Russians were banned from crossing the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:05">[11:05:05]</a>.

While a student deferment is a basis for not being subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:47">[11:47:47]</a>, there is no guarantee against being included in the database of those prohibited from leaving the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:54">[11:54:54]</a>. Martial law is anticipated to be introduced when mobilization becomes open, possibly around the anniversary of the start of the [[russian_military_actions_in_ukraine | special military operation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:30">[12:30:30]</a>. This would declare a "total war" and officially general mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:42">[12:42:42]</a>. Students are still expected to be unaffected by mobilization but may face travel bans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:57">[12:57:57]</a>.

### Foreign Participation in the Conflict
A "considerable number" of foreign private military company (PMC) fighters are engaged on the side of Ukraine, estimated at least a couple of thousand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:23">[14:23:23]</a>. These include retired special forces personnel from NATO armies, particularly from the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:37">[14:37:37]</a>, Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:50">[14:50:50]</a>, and Baltic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:53">[14:53:53]</a>. Many Poles, including former army personnel, are actively fighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:27">[16:27:27]</a>, often for material incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:41">[16:41:41]</a>.

### Relations between Russians and Ukrainians
Rebuilding human ties between Russians and Ukrainians after the cessation of military actions will be "very difficult" and "unlikely to recover quickly, if they recover at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:43">[24:43:43]</a>. In the eyes of Ukrainians, [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_international_relations | Russia]] and Russians will be perceived as a source of evil and threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:09:09">[25:09:09]</a>. However, the example of Germany and France, who overcame destructive wars, offers hope for future relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:24:24">[25:24:24]</a>.

## Economic Outlook for Russia
The likelihood of an economic crisis in [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_international_relations | Russia]] by the end of 2023-2024 is assessed as "quite high," with the reasons being more political than economic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:11:11">[26:11:11]</a>. While the economy will continue to function, there will be mass impoverishment, potential logistics disruptions, currency fluctuations, and high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:36:36">[26:36:36]</a>.

## Geopolitical Implications
The prospect of Baltic countries becoming victims of further aggression from [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_international_relations | Russia]] is "rapidly approaching zero" in the current, medium, and long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:07">[21:07:07]</a>.

If a nuclear strike on Ukraine were carried out, even of ultra-low power, the consequences would be unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:50">[20:50:50]</a>. A relatively safe place to hide would be "Far from a big town Far from military bases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:45:45">[20:45:45]</a>.

## 2023: A Year of Change
2023 has a strong chance of being the year "when we can decisively change our own fate, the fate of our people and our country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:54:54">[30:54:54]</a>. The speaker believes that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:21:21">[31:21:21]</a>.

This article summarizes discussions and predictions concerning [[potential_military_actions_and_geopolitical_influences | military events and geopolitical forecasts]], including economic impacts, military strategies, and internal political dynamics.

## Economic Outlook and Political Crisis
A significant political crisis is anticipated in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:13">[01:46:13]</a>. During such a crisis, people typically move towards defensive assets like currency or gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. It is predicted that currencies will rise in price, while real estate prices in Moscow will decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. The duration of this crisis will influence how quickly real estate prices recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. For those considering leaving Russia permanently, selling real estate now might be advisable, as demand is declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. However, holding real estate for a "long game" (a couple of years or more) could ultimately be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## Military Predictions and Operations
### Decisive Military Events
Andrey Kosmocha's forecasts, known for their high fulfillment rate, indicate that decisive military events will occur in March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. These events are expected to unfold from March until summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a> and are anticipated to favor Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

### Potential Battlefield: Crimea
There are scenarios, including serious ones reviewed by the Russian president, which suggest that Crimea could become a battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The fate of Crimea depends solely on the [[military_operations_and_strategic_goals | military operations and strategic goals]] dynamics between Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

### Logistics and Supply Routes
The transport hubs used for delivering weapons to Ukraine continue to operate despite Russian efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Efforts to disrupt railway tracks are largely ineffective because they are restored very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Striking the points where European gauge trains transition to Soviet gauge is considered risky due to the high probability of missiles hitting neighboring NATO territory, potentially triggering Article 5 of the NATO Charter, which Russia fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

### Use of Tactical Nuclear Weapons
If Russian armed forces suffer a crushing defeat in spring or early summer, the use of tactical nuclear weapons could move into the practical plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Putin has not removed this option from consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. However, there's a high probability that individuals within Putin's inner circle might try to prevent such an order from being carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>, as they do not want Russia to become a pariah state like North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

### Russian Offensive Plans
A massive Russian offensive in several directions is planned for late February or early March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This offensive is expected to be timed with the anniversary of the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Putin is also planning several conceptual speeches and significant steps around this anniversary, including the introduction of military movement in Russia (partially or wholly) and announcements of a second stage of mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. These [[preparations_for_decisive_battles_and_potential_mobilization | preparations for decisive battles and potential mobilization]] are an integral part of the offensive, which is expected to develop over several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. The security forces reportedly view this general offensive as an "unsuccessful" and "doomed undertaking" that could lead to colossal losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.

### Mobilization and Conscription
A "creeping mobilization" is ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, and a new wave of mobilization is considered almost inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. It is likely to begin in late February or the middle of the second half of February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. While by law, conscripts are not to be mobilized or sent to active duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>, a massive offensive with large human losses could change this, especially under visible martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. Students have deferments, but face risks if detained for hooliganism or public drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>, which could lead to expulsion and conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Academic performance among young people has increased due to the incentive to avoid conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

## Geopolitical Dynamics
### Aid to Ukraine
The delay in arms supplies to Ukraine is attributed to two main factors: some European countries do not want Ukraine to win on the battlefield, preferring a compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>, and there is a fear of Putin's unpredictability as the leader of a nuclear-armed country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. The United States has placed a bet on Russia's [[military_operations_and_strategic_goals | military defeat]], expecting it to lead to [[potential_political_and_military_developments_in_russia_and_ukraine | political changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

### China and Russia
If Russia significantly weakens, China is unlikely to engage in aggression, but rather could "fill demographic voids" in sparsely populated parts of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This demographic sparseness is expected to increase further due to the special military operation and the inevitable second stage of mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

### Transnistria
The chances of Transnistria's current status changing within the next five years are very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. This change will be connected to the ongoing crisis in Russia, which will likely prevent it from maintaining its influence over Transnistria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

### Belarus
Belarus is considered extremely unlikely to enter the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. The regime in Belarus is expected to change shortly after a regime change in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

### Russian Empire and CIS
The notion that no one wanted to leave the Russian Empire is historically inaccurate, as many desired independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. The current attempt to recreate the empire is seen as unnecessary and lacking ideological, moral, propaganda, or resource justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Russia is described as having revealed itself as a "cardboard tiger" in relation to the CIS countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics and Future Russia
### Political Crisis and Transformation
Russia is expected to face a serious, sharp, cardinal, and large-scale political crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. In this crisis, the interests of society and parts of the elite may converge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. While the form of resolution (revolution or evolutionary process) is unknown, peaceful transformations equivalent to a revolution are possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. The [[geopolitical_consequences_and_crisis_predictions_in_russia | geopolitical consequences and crisis predictions in Russia]] are substantial, and the year 2023 is seen as potentially decisive for the country's destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>.

### Post-Putin Russia
In a post-Putin Russia, all laws violating fundamental human rights will be canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Those responsible for developing or initiating these laws will face legal punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. A new service or department is considered necessary to protect citizens' rights and restore constitutional legality, including compensation for those whose rights were violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

Regarding the financial system, there will be a need to revise banking, credit, and monetary policies, offer credit holidays, and the state will likely have to assume some irrevocable debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Creating conditions for economic growth and prosperity will be crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

The "deep people" are regrettably not expected to support a democratic position if Putin falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Democracy will not spontaneously appear; people will have to fight for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. However, cultural models and values can change relatively quickly (within 10-15 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

After the main events conclude, veterans and "Putinists" are expected to coexist, forming their own unions and political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Narratives of betrayal and near-victory will likely persist for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>.

### Navalny's Team
Navalny's team is seen as reluctant to communicate with other opposition groups because they believe they hold key assets (organizational, media, and symbolic via Alexei himself) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. This perspective dictates that others should follow their lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. However, the current situation is more complex and the dynamics are not favoring Navalny's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. It is hoped that different opposition segments will eventually find common ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

### Role of Russians Abroad
Russians living abroad can primarily offer financial assistance to worthy people, organizations, or initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. They can also advocate for Russian political prisoners' interests through protests and pickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. When Russia undergoes large-scale economic transformation, their knowledge, technologies, experience, and money will be valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. This provides a pragmatic incentive beyond patriotism, as Russia will offer opportunities to earn well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

### Russia-US Relations
The USA is not seen as Russia's enemy, but rather a "problem" or "challenge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>. It would be unwise for Russia to insist on the US becoming an enemy, given the vast difference in potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>.

Valery Solovey recorded the 63rd episode of "What's Happening" on Monday, May 1st, in the first half of the day, around 2 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The episode focuses on the summary of the "special military operation" and the [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_stances_of_kremlin | international situation]] in which the Russian Federation finds itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Current International Standing
The current state of [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_stances_of_kremlin | international relations]] shows that the Russian president has found himself in [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_stances_of_kremlin | international isolation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

### Diplomatic Incidents
*   **South Africa Conference:** South Africa requested that Vladimir Putin not attend a planned conference in August in person, suggesting he speak via video link instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. As a result, the president has reportedly decided against most international trips, with the possible exception of Minsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   **China's Stance:** A recent conversation between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is seen as further evidence of deteriorating [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_stances_of_kremlin | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Putin might perceive China as "starting to wiggle" regarding weapons supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Following this conversation, Zelensky claimed that China agreed not to supply weapons to the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. This suggests China is "comparing watches" not only with Moscow but also with Kyiv before the anticipated Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

## International Perception of Leadership
Discussions about the president's doubles are intensifying not only outside the Russian Federation, but also in the media of the United States, Western Europe, and Britain, appearing in both tabloids and serious media outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The version of the president having doubles has gained traction, forcing the press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, to react indirectly, stating the president has "wonderful health" and is "hyperactive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. However, the idea of presidential doubles has become a "media reality" and a "reality of public opinion" within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

## Elite Discontent
Evidence of worsening attitudes within the Russian establishment is clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. A conversation between billionaire Roman Trotsenko and businessman Nikolai Matushevsky offers "vivid characteristics" of the present and [[future_challenges_in_russia | future]] policies of the Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. Additionally, a monologue by Andrei Valerievich Kosmocha on April 28th, addressing the situation, was reportedly watched by top leadership in both the Russian Federation and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

### Internal Political Consequences
The president himself is perceived by the Russian population as a "key problem," a "key threat," and a "toxic asset," rather than a source of well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This perception creates significant tension within the establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The inability to rely on the president's internal political position further complicates [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_stances_of_kremlin | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

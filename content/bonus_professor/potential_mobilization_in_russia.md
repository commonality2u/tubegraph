Recent discussions indicate that a nationwide [[mobilization in the Russian Federation | mobilization]] is not being dismissed and remains a possibility for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This idea is reportedly on the president's desk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Obstacles to Mobilization

There are two primary obstacles to the announcement of a nationwide [[mobilization in the Russian Federation | mobilization]]:

1.  **Image and Reputational Concerns** If, as the Russian president and press secretary repeatedly state, everything is going "according to plan" in the special military operation, announcing [[mobilization in the Russian Federation | mobilization]] would imply that the plan is not proceeding as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The government aims to show that Russia can achieve victory with "little bloodshed" on foreign territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
2.  **Risk of Political and Social Complications** The government is uncertain how society, particularly those in large cities, would react to a nationwide [[mobilization in the Russian Federation | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Potential Stages and Timing

One possible first stage for [[mobilization in the Russian Federation | mobilization]] could be the introduction of [[impact_of_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] in five frontline or border regions with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This would allow authorities to observe public reaction before proceeding further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

However, announcing [[mobilization in the Russian Federation | mobilization]] in the summer is not considered the best solution, as many potential conscripts are currently "unreachable" due to summer dispersion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Societal Preparation for Mobilization

There appears to be an "information, moral, and psychological preparation" of society for [[mobilization in the Russian Federation | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Recent events, such as the widely publicized case of hockey player Ivan Fedotov being sent to serve in the north, and accusations against three others for illegally acquiring military tickets, are seen as exemplary floggings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. These actions are intended to demonstrate that "everyone will be equal" before [[mobilization in the Russian Federation | mobilization]], regardless of their name or fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

Despite these preparations, the government is reportedly not confident that society will react positively to a [[mobilization in the Russian Federation | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>, and it is considered unlikely that half a million young and not-so-young people would voluntarily report to military enlistment offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

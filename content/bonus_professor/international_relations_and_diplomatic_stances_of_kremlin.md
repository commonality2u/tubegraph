The [[Kremlins policies and international relations | Kremlin's]] international relations and diplomatic stances have faced recent challenges and shifts, particularly concerning the war in Ukraine and its engagement with Western nations.

## G20 Foreign Ministers Meeting: Public Humiliation in Bali

Russia's Minister of Foreign Affairs experienced significant public humiliation at the G20 meeting on the island of Bali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
*   **Diplomatic Snubs** Colleagues refused to participate in meetings, take pictures, or have dinner with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Media Disinterest** Journalists showed no interest in the Foreign Minister of a country claiming superpower status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
*   **Unprecedented Humiliation** This treatment is described as a humiliation not only for the Russian Foreign Ministry but also for the [[Kremlins policies and international relations | Kremlin]], Russian power, and Russia as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. Such treatment of a Russian Foreign Minister is unprecedented, even during Soviet times or the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. It is considered an "achievement" of Russian foreign policy and diplomacy in its demonstrative nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## President Putin's Health and its Impact on Policy

Concerns have been raised about President Putin's health and its potential impact on his decision-making.
*   **Physical Condition** Putin is described as a "seriously ill person with cancer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. While pain can be managed with modern drugs, removing it completely would prevent him from speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. During a speech, he reportedly swayed his body and held onto the table, indicating difficulty speaking and managing his condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Impact** His state of health and ability to assess situations and make decisions directly affect the fate and lives of millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. A "sick consciousness" may lead to a return to basic thinking structures formed in his youth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.
*   **"We Haven't Even Started Yet"** His statement regarding Ukraine, "we haven't even started yet," is compared to teenage bravado <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

## Potential for Nationwide Mobilization

Putin's phrase "we haven't even started yet" is seen as a potential signal that nationwide mobilization is still under consideration by the [[Kremlins policies and international relations | Kremlin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. An urgent State Duma meeting on July 15, with deputies returning from vacation, might be related to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

However, there are two significant obstacles to announcing such a mobilization:
1.  **Image and Reputation** Announcing mobilization contradicts the official narrative that "everything is going according to plan" in the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
2.  **Political and Social Complications** The societal reaction, especially in large cities, is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.
    *   As a first step, martial law might be introduced in five border regions with Ukraine to gauge reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
    *   Summer is not considered the best time for mobilization due to potential conscripts being unreachable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.
    *   Recent arrests of hockey players accused of illegally acquiring military tickets are viewed as "information, moral, and psychological preparation" for mobilization, demonstrating that "everyone will be equal before mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## [[Kremlins foreign policy and decisionmaking | Kremlin's Foreign Policy]] and the British

The [[Kremlins foreign policy and decisionmaking | Kremlin]] views the resignation of Boris Johnson as UK Prime Minister with quiet gloating, as Great Britain is considered the main protagonist of the anti-[[Kremlins policies and international relations | Kremlin]] coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

*   **Dislike for the British** President Putin's dislike for the British is attributed to several reasons, including a deeply personal one that is not yet public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.
*   **Corporate Affiliation** A significant reason is Putin's background as an officer of the Soviet KGB, which traditionally instilled hostility towards the British, considering them the main competitors of Soviet intelligence services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. This hostility extends to the British political class and British politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>. Britain is perceived as a spearhead of intrigues against the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

## German Stance on Ukraine Aid and Secret Diplomacy

Germany is seen as reluctant to assist Ukraine, with the German authorities reportedly blocking a 9 billion Euro aid package from the European Union for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. Their actions are perceived as prioritizing their own national interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.

*   **Prolonged Conflict** The prolonged and unclear outcome of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, with no strategic breakthrough for either side, is causing significant problems, especially for Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.
*   **Secret Diplomatic Discussions** Key European allies, along with Washington, are reportedly engaged in secret diplomatic discussions to resolve the Ukrainian conflict, seeking to minimize or abandon force in favor of dialogue and negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.
*   **Obstacles to Peace** A peaceful solution is considered difficult until a clear breakthrough occurs or until the parties to the conflict are exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>. Ukraine's Ministry of Defense has announced plans for a counter-offensive to reclaim southern territories controlled by Russia, including the Kherson and parts of Zaporizhia regions, preparing a "million-strong army" for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>.

## Mobilization of Resources Amidst Sanctions

In anticipation of a long conflict and current/threatening sanctions, the Russian government is seeking ways to mobilize resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>.
*   **Sale of Jewelry** The government has introduced a bill to allow the state to sell jewelry abroad from its repository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. This act draws a historical parallel to the early Soviet era, when the Bolsheviks sold confiscated royal and aristocratic jewelry, and later Hermitage paintings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>.
*   **Repressions** The government is also resorting to repressions, reminiscent of a 19th-century joke: "Call your son arrest; arrests are in fashion now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>.
    *   A wave of repressions has begun against individuals seeking to participate in municipal deputy elections in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>.
    *   Strong candidates and current deputies are being persecuted, charged, and prevented from registering their candidacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>.
    *   Aleksey Goryanov received a 7-year sentence for using a word prohibited in the Russian Federation to describe the "special military operation," marking the first such sentence for discrediting the Russian army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>.

Alexander Lukashenko, as the sole perceived ally of the Russian Federation and President Vladimir Putin, visited Beijing for three days in early March 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## Objectives of the Visit
During his visit, Lukashenko made several requests to Chinese officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>:
*   Guarantee the preservation of Belarus's sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   Provide political support for his authoritarian regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   Offer financial assistance to his regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

Lukashenko also declared his support for the [[chinas_stance_on_russia_and_ukraine_conflict | Chinese plan for a peaceful settlement]] of the armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. He demonstrated strong loyalty to China, viewing it as the "new master of Eurasia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. It is noted that Lukashenko did not convey any messages from the Kremlin or Putin to Xi Jinping, focusing exclusively on Belarus's own problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

## Kremlin's Reaction and Lukashenko's Motivations
The Kremlin expressed discontent over Lukashenko's visit, as he was primarily occupied with solving his own issues rather than acting as an intermediary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

Despite Belarus's geographical proximity to Russia, Lukashenko actively seeks to balance the influence of the Kremlin and Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. His efforts are aimed at protecting Belarus from both actual and formal absorption by Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This concern stems from the belief that if Russia loses the confrontation with Ukraine, it might attempt to absorb Belarus to compensate for its significant failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Lukashenko is acutely aware of this risk and is therefore seeking Beijing's support as a counterweight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

China has previously provided crucial support to other nations in Russia's vicinity, such as [[kazakhstans_diplomatic_stance_towards_russia | Kazakhstan]] and its leader Tokayev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

Valery Solovyov, a doctor of historical sciences, political analyst, and public figure, discusses the degradation of the Russian state and society, particularly focusing on the philosophical connection between morality, state, and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## The State as an Apparatus of Violence: A Reconsideration

The common understanding, often attributed to the Soviet version of Marxism, is that the state is merely an apparatus of violence and coercion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. However, Solovyov argues that violence and coercion are not ends in themselves for the state; they serve a purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

### Aristotle's Definition of the State

According to Aristotle, the meaning of the state lies in determining what is fair and what is not, and in maintaining justice while eradicating injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. The apparatus of violence is necessary for this purpose: to strive for justice and eradicate injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. A more mundane, perhaps more accurate, definition is that the state exists not to create paradise on earth, but to prevent hell on earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### The Russian State and Justice

Solovyov challenges whether the Russian state has fought for justice over the past 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. He questions if beggarly pensions, raising the retirement age, court decisions, or the distribution of income reflect justice in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. He asserts that the state in Russia appears to exist only to create hell, having abandoned its basic prerogative of defining what is fair and what is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Instead, it supports injustice, seemingly purposefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Theological and Sociological Perspectives on the State

Solovyov draws upon other authorities to describe a state that abandons justice:

*   **Saint Augustine**: In the absence of justice, the state turns into a gang of robbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Mancur Olson**: Modern sociology defines the state as a "stationary bandit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

Such a type of statehood leads to extremely unpleasant consequences, as the opposition of good and evil becomes blurred where there is no justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## The State and Moral Choice

The Russian state, according to Solovyov, constantly interferes in personal life and forces citizens into a "vice of moral choice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Examples include:

*   Teachers and members of election commissions being compelled to falsify results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   Businessmen being pressured to give bribes and kickbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

This pervasive pressure leads individuals to choose what is immoral or bad, closing their eyes to abuse, deception, and rudeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. While excuses like "no other choice" or "everyone does the same" are common, this constant choice, partly dictated by the state and partly made voluntarily, leads to a "social and personal deceit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

This societal choice against good, driven by a desire to avoid punishment, economic losses, and social risks, has led Russia down "the straight roads to the door of hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. Russia is described as a country of militant immorality and barbarism, capable of leading the whole world to catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## The Path Forward: Restoring Foundations

Despite the grim outlook, Solovyov expresses hope for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. If Russia survives, the most important future task will not be economic restoration or the formation of a new, even democratic, state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Instead, it will be the restoration of moral foundations:

*   A return to distinguishing between good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.
*   Understanding that justice exists and is innate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.
*   Reaffirming that the state exists for justice, not merely as an apparatus of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   Getting rid of the blatant injustice in which the country lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

Without this return to the basic foundations of morality, everything will be hopelessly useless and doomed to repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. The goal is to "return human" to the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

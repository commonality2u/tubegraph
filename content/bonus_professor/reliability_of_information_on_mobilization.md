This article addresses the reliability of information concerning military [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | mobilization]] and its broader implications, as presented by Valery Solovyov on his YouTube channel.

## Addressing Audience Concerns

Valery Solovyov acknowledges receiving numerous questions and feedback regarding his previous episode, particularly concerning a potential second stage of [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | mobilization]] which he warned could begin after the New Year holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>. He notes a strong [[psychological_impact_of_mobilization | psychological reaction]] from viewers, with some expressing that his news causes "nightmares" and makes it difficult to sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

Solovyov challenges this reaction, suggesting that his audience, predominantly men over 35 from the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:38">[01:38:38]</a>, should possess sufficient life experience and "social maturity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>. He defines social maturity as the ability to view events "sensibly and impartially," accepting the truth regardless of its unpleasantness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. He criticizes attempts to "shield oneself" from reality as "infantile" behavior, comparing it to how teenagers might think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:33">[02:33:33]</a>. He suggests that those unwilling to face reality should watch state-controlled channels that present a "warm, cozy, at the same time exalted world of the Great Mighty Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a>.

He emphasizes that his information is for those who are ready to look at the world sensibly, impartially, and, most importantly, are willing to take responsibility for their own behavior and actions, rather than deflecting it onto the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:25">[03:25:25]</a>.

## Track Record of Predictions

Solovyov asserts the reliability of his information by referencing past predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:45">[03:45:45]</a>:
*   **Armed Confrontation with Ukraine:** He claims his information was reliable regarding the inevitability of an armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine, having spoken about it months before February 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:51">[03:51:51]</a>. He specifically refers to a conversation on December 31, 2021, where he predicted the confrontation would begin the following year, even naming the date with an accuracy of up to a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:29">[04:29:29]</a>.
*   **Initial Mobilization:** He states that since spring, he had indicated a decision for [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | mobilization]] was made, predicting it would occur in the fall, and that it would be a "belated decision" resulting in insufficient equipment and preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:52">[04:52:52]</a>.
*   **Martial Law:** Similarly, he claims to have stated since spring that a fundamental decision was made to introduce martial law in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:19">[05:19:19]</a>. He notes that partial [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | mobilization]] was declared on September 21, and martial law was introduced a month later, on October 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:31">[05:31:31]</a>.

## Understanding "Inevitable"

Solovyov clarifies that when he speaks of the "inevitability" of the second stage of [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | mobilization]], he means a "high, high probability," not an absolute certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:05">[06:05:05]</a>. He states that in the world, only two things are truly inevitable: death and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:08">[06:08:08]</a>.

## Purpose of Information Dissemination

He explains that the purpose of repeatedly sharing this information is multi-faceted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:18">[06:18:18]</a>:
*   **Influence Decision-Making:** The more widely such information spreads, the greater the chance that the "Supreme Authority" will hesitate before making such decisions, or will implement them with less "horrific cruelty" and on a smaller scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:42">[06:42:42]</a>. He states that the dissemination of information about upcoming decisions can either cancel them or influence their adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>.
*   **Prevention:** He explicitly states that warnings are given to prevent certain outcomes, not merely to forecast them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:39">[07:39:39]</a>. He implies that if [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | mobilization]] were not announced, he would be glad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:32">[07:32:32]</a>.
*   **Preparation:** The second main meaning is to allow people to prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:06">[08:06:06]</a>. He emphasizes that "whoever is forewarned is forearmed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:50">[07:50:50]</a>. He believes that the more people know and spread this information, the more benefit they will bring to themselves and their compatriots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:12">[08:12:12]</a>.

## Implications for the Population

Solovyov views the attitude towards [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | mobilization]] as a "general national test" of intelligence, the ability to build cause-and-effect relationships, and the presence of a "will to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:24">[08:24:24]</a>. He challenges those who believe they must fight for Russia's territorial integrity and resources to "get up from the couch, take a machine gun, and go to the trenches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:06">[10:06:06]</a>. He dismisses the idea that fighting can pay off personal loans or improve one's situation, warning that families of those who die will receive little to no compensation or support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:18">[10:18:18]</a>.

He argues that a passive, obedient response to a [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | summons]] indicates a "weakened survival instinct" and a "lack of will to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:48">[11:48:48]</a>. He contrasts this with a "she-wolf" hiding her cubs, while mothers send their children to a foreign country "for no clear reason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:05">[12:05:05]</a>. He advises listeners to use their intelligence and "fight for your only life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:47">[19:47:47]</a>, as there will be no second chance or compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:53">[19:53:53]</a>.

He also advises people to have cash on hand, as the Russian banking and [[financial implications of mobilization | financial system]] is expected to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:09">[20:09:09]</a>. He believes that foreign currency will remain valuable, even if officially banned, due to a likely black market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:11">[21:11:11]</a>.

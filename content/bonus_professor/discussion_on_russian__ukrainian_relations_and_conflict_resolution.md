This article discusses various aspects of the [[russianukrainian_relations_and_military_tensions | Russian-Ukrainian relations and military tensions]], focusing on the prospects for peace and the complexities involved in reaching a resolution.

## Prospects for Conflict Resolution

### Russian Public's Understanding of the Conflict

When asked if the Russian people who supported the [[russia_and_ukraine_conflict_dynamics | conflict]] would understand their government's actions and apologize to Ukrainians, the speaker expressed pessimism. They believe that people often "close themselves off from recognizing an unacceptable reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. There is a tendency to ignore the "bloody confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Unless significant "work explanation" is done to detail "what was why it was done and what are the monstrously negative results" for both Ukraine and Russia, people will not understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The speaker cautions against hoping for common sense or drawing lessons from Soviet or Russian experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Desire for Peace within Russian Elite

The speaker notes an "absolutely predominant" desire within the Russian elite to conclude peace with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. However, the key question remains "on what terms" this peace would be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. There is hope that a peace agreement with Ukraine will be concluded not by the current government (which is seen as a continuation or even a more severe modification of Putin's government), but by a "new government of the new Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

### Ukrainian Stance on Peace Negotiations

The speaker ponders why the Ukrainian side, including its leadership and intelligence, has not made public statements about certain significant events related to Russian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Two assumptions are offered:
*   **Fear of mistake**: They might be afraid of making a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Intelligence limitations**: Ukrainian intelligence might be proficient in sabotage but "not very good at strategic political intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Negotiation implications**: The Ukrainians, including their leadership, might be afraid that if certain information about the death of a Russian leader is confirmed, the question of [[consultations_and_proposals_for_resolving_the_ukraine_conflict | peace negotiations]] could change significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Ukraine had officially stated that a certain leader's existence was a main obstacle to peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. This raises the question of what [[consultations_and_proposals_for_resolving_the_ukraine_conflict | peace formula]] the Ukrainian leadership would be ready to accept, dismissing previous "loud statements" by President Zelensky as unfeasible according to American press <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

### Russian Military Strategy and Peace Talks

Regarding the [[ukraine_conflict_and_nato_relations | confrontation with Ukraine]], Russia is expected to continue its offensive on Avdiivka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. Despite "colossal losses," the Russian military leadership believes that taking Avdiivka will increase the chances of the West forcing Ukraine to enter [[consultations_and_proposals_for_resolving_the_ukraine_conflict | peace talks]] with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Additionally, the new Russian leadership, particularly Nikolai Patrushev, is proposing to enter [[consultations_and_proposals_for_resolving_the_ukraine_conflict | peace talks]] through Lukashenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

## Conclusion

The speaker expresses understanding of public concerns and acknowledges the many questions related to the formation of a "new political reality in Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. They emphasize the importance of being ready to "influence the fate of our long-suffering country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.

Based on accumulated indirect data and insider information as of October 15, 2023, Russia is believed to be involved in the actions of Hamas against Israel, likely operating "under a foreign flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. This involvement is characterized by three main aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>:

## Aspects of Involvement

*   **Intelligence and Planning Assistance**
    Russia provided assistance to Hamas with sensitive information and helped in planning the operation, although this assistance is considered unlikely to have been highly significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

*   **Combat and Tactical Training**
    Instructors from the [[the_role_of_prigozhin_and_wagner_group_in_political_landscape | Wagner PMC]] reportedly carried out combat and tactical training for Hamas fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. It is emphasized that these were [[the_role_of_prigozhin_and_wagner_group_in_political_landscape | Wagner]] instructors, not personnel from the Main Directorate of the former Russian General Staff or regular Russian army servicemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

*   **Weapon Supply**
    Hamas is believed to have received weapons, half of which are Russian-made, possibly through the same [[the_role_of_prigozhin_and_wagner_group_in_political_landscape | Wagner PMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This alleged supply was intended to demonstrate that Ukraine was involved in the attack via weapon leaks, rather than directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

## Russian Motivation

The motivation behind Russia's alleged involvement is twofold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>:

1.  **Opening a Second Front:** To divert Western attention from Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
2.  **Revenge:** An individual referred to as "Putin" decided to take revenge on someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. This is linked to Israeli doctors who supervised his cancer treatment from 2020 and performed surgery in February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. In spring, these doctors stated they would no longer be involved in his treatment, having done all they could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. This decision may have provoked the "patient's fate is in the hands of God" response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## Context of Hamas Operations

The Hamas operation is described as having occurred with the active participation and patronage of international terrorist networks, and apparently with the active participation of Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. It is an "open secret" that Iran is involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>. However, it is not worth overstating Russia's participation in this operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

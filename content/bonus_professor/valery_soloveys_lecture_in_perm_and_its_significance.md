The episode was recorded on Sunday afternoon, December 4, and released on Monday, December 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The Perm Lecture Event

On December 2, Valery Solovey spoke to the public in Perm and other Russian cities at 6:00 PM local time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. His lecture was titled "How history influences, or more accurately, allows you to understand the present and foresee the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

The audience for the lecture was diverse, including not only Perm residents but also people from the Western Urals, Moscow, West Siberia, and the Volga region, representing a considerable part of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Audience Interest and Questions

Attendees were primarily interested in personal communication and answers to their questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. While history was touched upon, the questions mainly focused on the current situation in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The main questions posed by the audience included:
*   Questions of survival, especially in connection with mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   The general economic prospects of Russia, which Solovey described as "joyless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   The future of Russia once current events are over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   The global context, often with a "subtle conspiracy tint" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

One typical question from the audience regarding the global context was whether the confrontation between Russia and Ukraine was:
*   A trap for Russia into which Russia successfully drew the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   A plan by "over the national global forces that govern world politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Solovey stated that he answered negatively to both parts of this question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Significance of the Lecture

The questions from the audience highlight the public's primary concerns in Russia at the time: personal survival amidst mobilization, the deteriorating economic situation, and uncertainty about the country's future. The inclusion of conspiracy theories in questions about the global context also reflects a certain segment of public thought. Solovey uses these questions to underscore the disconnect between the perception of the Russian elite and the reality experienced by ordinary citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

Discussions about a potential [[Russian internal political dynamics|split in the Russian elites]] have recently moved from hypothetical speculation to concrete formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. What is described as a "drain coalition" or an "anti-Chekist coalition" has begun to take shape, sometimes more accurately referred to as an "anti-Patrushev sky coalition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## Formation and Motivation
This emerging [[coalitions_in_russian_politics|coalition]] represents a "powerful elite coalition" formed in opposition to the idea of power remaining in the hands of a security group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. The primary catalyst for its formation is the extreme resistance to Nikolai Patrushev, the Secretary of the Security Council, who is attempting to position his son, Dmitry Patrushev (Minister of Agriculture), as the successor to President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. This resistance stems from both civilian and power groups within the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

The "struggle for Putin's Russia" has begun, driven by the elite's understanding that President Putin will soon have to leave his position or significantly weaken his presence in Russian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This internal political agenda is expected to take precedence for the Kremlin by late autumn or early winter, potentially making the ongoing military operation an "excessive" hindrance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## Key Figures
Key figures reportedly involved in forming this anti-Patrushev/anti-Chekist coalition include:
*   Roman Abramovich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>
*   Anatoly Chubais <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
*   Vladimir Potanin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>
*   Oleg Deripaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>
    *   Deripaska notably demonstrated dissent by not applauding Putin during his speech at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, instead appearing busy with a folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   The "Yeltsin family" is also associated with Oleg Deripaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

These individuals, despite not always being on good terms, are united by "class closeness" and possibly a shared vision for Russia's future without Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.

## Proposed Successors
This coalition reportedly sees Finance Minister Siluanov as a potential future president and Nabiullina as the head of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This indicates a clear "confrontation between civilians and security forces" within the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

## Implications and Outlook
The emergence of this coalition marks the opening of a "hunting season" for those who may pose a threat or whose departure from politics and life could signal shifts in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Recent sudden deaths of oil workers and Alexei Agafonov, former head of Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company (UMMC), are noted as potentially suspicious in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

The process of this [[possibility_of_political_change_in_russia|political change]] has begun and is expected to intensify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. While it will be "difficult" and "extremely unpleasant" in the coming months, these internal conflicts may open opportunities for active Russian citizens to influence the country's historical trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

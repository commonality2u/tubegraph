## Economic Outlook and Forecasts

### Currency Stability
The ruble is anticipated to face a "far from favorable prospect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. It is always advised to acquire dollars or Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

### Cryptocurrency and Banking
*   **Cryptocurrency**: There are no current plans to ban cryptocurrency or crypto exchanges in Russia, despite ongoing discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. The country is considered to be in "dire need" of utilizing these tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Bank Deposits**: In the event of a spontaneous, avalanche-like financial crisis, the possibility of freezing citizens' deposits is not excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. While deposits may not be entirely inaccessible, their use would be limited, with restricted cash withdrawals from accounts and tightened limits on cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The specific restrictions are unknown, but the idea is ready for implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Proposed Reforms and Policies

### Income and Social Welfare
A future government aims to significantly increase the minimum wage, potentially two to three times its current level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This increase would be funded by internal resources, budget redistribution, and a reduction in theft and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Housing and Mortgages
Plans are underway to decrease housing prices and mortgage costs through rationalization, increased efficiency, and the establishment of order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Pension System Reform
*   **Retirement Age**: A new team plans to return to the previous retirement age within one to one and a half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>.
*   **Compensation**: Individuals who retired under the increased age (e.g., at 62 or 63) will receive financial compensation, to be paid in a short timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.
*   **State Aid for Medicine**: People who are retired and facing difficult social circumstances are guaranteed to receive vital drugs for free or with a significant discount (70-90%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.

### Combating Data Leaks and Corruption
The problem of mass personal data leaks, often originating from government agencies, is recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. Individuals within government agencies who profit from and protect this business are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. The new government aims to stop these massive leaks and punish those responsible, with an estimated timeframe of two to six months to curb the "Homeric fraud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

## Challenges and Corruption
Government theft is highlighted as a significant issue, exemplified by the ongoing construction and demolition at the Gelendzhik palace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. This process is described as a "gigantic theft of budgets," with who lives in the palace being irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. The primary goal is identified as stealing from the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

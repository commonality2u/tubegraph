The following article discusses the reasons individuals may be declared a "foreign agent" in Russia, based on information from Valery Solovey's program on December 4, 2022.

## Reasons for Being Declared a Foreign Agent in Russia

Professor Valery Solovey was declared a foreign agent by the Ministry of Justice in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Initially, no explanation is provided when an individual is declared a foreign agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Solovey's claim against the Ministry of Justice regarding this declaration was considered in a court hearing in Moscow on December 2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### Stated Grounds for Declaration

During the court hearing, the Ministry of Justice presented two primary considerations for declaring Solovey a foreign agent:
*   **YouTube Monetization** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>: Solovey had enabled monetization on his YouTube videos, meaning YouTube placed advertisements, and he received income from this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. He states that he had no other income sources at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This specific charge was also the basis for Yuri Dud's inclusion on the foreign agent list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Fees from Western Research Institute** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>: Solovey received fees two or three times from a small research institute in the West for participating in their seminars and conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. He notes this is a common practice in academia, where travel expenses are often covered and fees provided for participation in Western events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Legal Interpretation by the Ministry of Justice

The Ministry of Justice does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the foreign financing and the individual's alleged political activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. For the Ministry, it is sufficient to simply establish the fact of receiving foreign financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

This interpretation implies that any Russian blogger—whether focusing on sports, cooking, or social life—who receives monetization from YouTube can be accused of political statements and declared a foreign agent, even for seemingly innocuous comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Solovey gives an example of a culinary blogger who might be accused of humiliating their country's history or culinary tradition by stating that dumplings are borrowed from China, leading to a foreign agent declaration if they also receive YouTube monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### Broader Implications of the [[law_on_foreign_agents_and_its_implications | Foreign Agent Law]]

Solovey highlights that the ease with which nearly all Russian bloggers can be included in the foreign agent list, even with a "very small, moderate desire," is concerning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. He sardonically suggests that to be declared a foreign agent, one only needs to "love your homeland and try to protect it" and "do the best for your people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. In contrast, those who "rob your homeland," "buy stolen goods," "build villas," and "open multi-million dollar accounts in Western banks and offshore companies" are considered "true patriots of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

The discussion implies a system where genuine efforts to benefit society can lead to prosecution, while corrupt practices by those in power, who may seek refuge abroad as discussed in [[russian_officials_seeking_refuge_abroad | Russian officials seeking refuge abroad]], are tolerated or even rewarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

Being labeled a foreign agent imposes "serious restrictions" on individuals, including pedagogical activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. Solovey encourages continued support and reposting of his videos to help "a foreign agent and his family survive in modern Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.

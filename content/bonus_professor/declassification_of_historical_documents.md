When a new government assumes power in Russia, a key objective will be the declassification of historical documents from agencies such as the KGB and FSB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This initiative aims to reveal the full truth about past actions and ensure societal understanding of what occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Scope of Declassification

The plan involves opening the archives, with the exception of top-secret units, which are typically preserved in such collections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The statute of limitations will be automatically applied to these documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Revelation of Informers

A significant aspect of this declassification will be the public identification of all informers who worked against or within [[repression_and_political_climate_in_russia | Russian society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This information, despite any prior promises of protection given by the Armed Forces, is recorded and will be made available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Preparing for Revelations
> Society is advised to prepare for an "avalanche of revelations" that will be "extremely unpleasant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Purpose of Declassification

The primary goal of declassification is to prevent similar events from recurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. People need to be aware and confident that wrongdoing is punishable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This process is intended to bring about "glasnost" (openness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Broader Societal Impact

The declassification aims to cleanse society of the "monstrous total lie" in which it currently operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Telling the truth, even if shocking, is considered essential for this cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

The true [[historical_interpretation_and_its_influence_on_current_events | history]] of Russia, particularly the last 2.5 years and the quarter-century preceding it, needs to be fully covered and reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. This truthful, impartial, and potentially unpleasant narrative will become part of school socialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. While individuals cannot be forced to accept moral responsibility, the new conditions are expected to encourage a more honest and unflattering self-reflection on the past and present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

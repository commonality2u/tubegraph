From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Valery Solovey, in the 12th episode of his program, addressed questions regarding the existence of [[allegations_of_putins_double | Putin's doubles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. He asserted that such doubles exist and has been discussing this for the past two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Evidence for Doubles

According to Solovey, observable evidence for the existence of doubles became apparent in February. Viewers could verify this by comparing:
*   **Behavior Patterns** The behavior patterns of the individual speaking before the Federal Assembly differed significantly from the individual speaking at the concert in Luzhniki <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. These were described as "different behavior patterns of different people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Photographic Analysis** Careful examination of photographs available widely online also revealed differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
*   **Journalistic Claims** Journalist Alexander Minkin wrote an article at the end of February claiming that a double was in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This is now considered a "common shared opinion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Knowledge and Future Use

The existence of a double is well-known within the [[russian_political_analysis | Russian Elite]] and the main part of the President's staff has been aware of it for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

It is predicted that in March, after Vladimir Vladimirovich undergoes another course of treatment, his speeches will likely be almost exclusively online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Meanwhile, his double is expected to appear in public for at least some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This highlights the [[role_and_influence_of_doubles_in_russian_politics | role and influence of doubles in Russian politics]] and [[the_role_of_doubles_and_misinformation_in_russian_politics | misinformation in Russian politics]].

## Reliability of Information

Concerns about the reliability of sources, particularly concerning [[putins_control_and_health_speculations | Putin's severe incurable disease]] and the presence of a double, are addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. While such information is typically hidden, it is a "big misconception" that the circle of those with this information is small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The President's large staff, including security, service personnel, referents, and assistants, means this information has gradually leaked out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

Solovey states with "absolute certainty" that major Western intelligence agencies are aware of the Russian President's health status, and this factor is included in their advice to governments regarding military-political plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## Impact on Domestic Politics

The increasing use of a double to replace Putin is seen as a significant factor in domestic politics, suggesting that the process of Putin's departure is merely being delayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

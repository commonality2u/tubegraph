The 158th episode of Valery Solovey's program "What is Happening," broadcast on Monday, December 2, discussed Kazakhstan's diplomatic stance towards Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Putin's Visit to Kazakhstan and Its Outcome

A recent trip by Vladimir Putin, or his perceived double, to Kazakhstan was a central topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The visit was an attempt to persuade Kazakhstan to increase import volumes through its territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> and to more actively participate in the supply of dual-use products to the Russian Federation, acting as an intermediary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Kazakhstan's Refusal
Kazakhstani President Tokayev responded to Russia's requests politely but adamantly with a negative answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. He indicated that Kazakhstan had already "exhausted all its aid resources," specifically transit aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Strengthening aid or increasing import volumes through Kazakhstan to Russia would lead to "serious problems" for the Kazakh economy and its financial and banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Tokayev's Demeanor
During the interaction, President Tokayev reportedly displayed "clear mockery" and a "dismissive attitude" towards the individual identified as Putin's double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. In the behavioral dynamic between the two, Tokayev "clearly dominated," which was "very, very noticeable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This suggests a significant shift in diplomatic power dynamics. The Russian leadership, referred to as "nobles who rule Russia," are perceived as thinking it's beneath them to negotiate or ask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Broader Implications of Russia's Diminished Standing

Following Kazakhstan's refusal, Russia's response involved boasting about a "miracle weapon" capable of changing the strategic situation, threatening London and the "whole of Europe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This behavior was described as an "impotent" boasting of "former sexual exploits and mythical sexual power," with the rocket acting as a "phallic symbol of Dada" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

The "hazelnut" missile, with the exception of one or two specimens used, is not very original or new, being a "recombination and modernization of missile weapons" from Soviet times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Establishing its serial production is a "long and long not fast" matter, a fact known to Western countries, who react with "sly grins" and sarcasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This indicates that [[reputation_and_international_relations_of_russia | Russia's international relations]] and its perceived strength are waning.

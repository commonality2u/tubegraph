The presidential elections in the United States are considered the most significant international event of the past week, with profound implications for global peace and international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. While the U.S. may no longer hold the position of an "unquestioning leader" as it did in previous decades, its leading role persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Consequently, many countries, including the Russian Federation, adjust their foreign and domestic policies based on the outcomes of these elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The Kremlin was keenly aware of the importance of these elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. According to information from the SVR general Telegram channel, hot on the heels of the elections, on November 6, two prominent Russian elite coalitions, led by Chemezov and Patrushev, extended "enthusiastic congratulations" to Donald Trump through informal channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Trump's Response and Peace Proposals

Trump responded to these messages on the same day, describing the situation between Russia and Ukraine as an "incident" that it is "time to end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This perspective aligns with what can be considered Trump's [[influence_of_trumps_foreign_policy_ambitions | foreign policy views]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

One of the key messages from the Russian elite concerned not peace, but a "truce" as a preliminary and necessary stage for peace negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. On November 7, a conversation reportedly took place between Trump and the "so-called president of Russia" (identified as a double) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

The Kremlin's proposed contours for peace include:
*   Crimea remaining with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   Donetsk and Luhansk regions (within administrative borders) remaining with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   Ukraine possibly yielding the Kursk region in exchange for Russia giving up fragments of territories in Kherson and Zaporozhye regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   A significant shift: the Kremlin backed down on its previous insistence of retaining a land corridor to Crimea, offering to abandon this idea if Ukraine guarantees unimpeded transit of goods and people from mainland Russia to Crimea through Ukrainian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

Trump's initial reaction to these proposals was a pause, stating he could not comment off the cuff and would need to consider and discuss them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The leak of this conversation suggests that some individuals in Trump's circle may view these proposals as unrealistic or undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## [[influence_of_trumps_foreign_policy_ambitions | Trump's Foreign Policy Ambitions]] and Challenges

Trump's worldview reportedly places Ukraine in a "subordinate position," with a commercial logic guiding his approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. However, the American president's powers, while significant, are not absolute, even with his party controlling Congress and the Supreme Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Trump will have to contend with officials within his own party who may have different views on the Russia-Ukraine confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Key positions influencing foreign policy include the Secretary of State and the Assistant to the President for National Security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

Furthermore, the "Deep State"—the Washington bureaucracy—which previously blocked some of Trump's initiatives during his first term, still exists and can influence decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### Peacemaker Ambitions

For his second and final term, Trump is believed to desire "epochal" achievements in both domestic and international policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. He has expressed a desire to be known as the "president of peace and not the president of war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Acting as a "peacemaker," ideally as a "winner" rather than someone leaving behind chaos (like in Afghanistan or Iraq), would be a significant achievement for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. There is speculation that he might even secretly aspire to a Nobel Peace Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

Trump's economic-centric approach to international relations provides a strong incentive to strive for peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. As president of the most powerful country, he has the potential to influence and even pressure both sides of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

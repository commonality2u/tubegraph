The global situation is described as being close to or repeating the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This assessment comes as a result of official Russian statements made even before the start of [[military_and_nuclear_concerns_regarding_ukraine_and_russia | military actions]] in Ukraine, indicating that some [[impact_of_economic_sanctions_on_russia | economic sanctions]] would be perceived as a declaration of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Economic War and its Impact

The West has openly declared that it has begun to wage an [[economic_impacts_of_sanctions_on_russia | economic war]] against the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This war is said to be inflicting extremely prolonged blows on the Russian economy and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, resulting in the Russian ruble being completely undermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. The Russian economy is viewed as very weak and highly dependent on external relations, particularly economic ties with Europe, the European Union, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

The West has indicated that it will not halt its efforts and will continue to increase pressure as [[military_and_nuclear_concerns_regarding_ukraine_and_russia | military operations]] in Ukraine persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This continued pressure is expected to have a dangerous impact on the Russian economy, potentially leading to very serious socio-political consequences and the possibility of mass protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

## Nuclear Blackmail and Kremlin Strategy

In response to these economic pressures, the Kremlin reportedly believes that threatening with [[potential_use_of_nuclear_weapons | nuclear weapons]] is an effective way to halt the dangerous impact on the Russian economy and to achieve significant concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This strategy involves the possibility of demonstrating tactical nuclear weapons on a limited scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. The speaker recalls a famous phrase attributed to Putin: "They will all die and we will go to heaven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>, implying that the ruling group of the Russian elite is willing to send others to heaven but not themselves, as they possess first-class shelters equipped even with swimming pools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. In contrast, ordinary citizens would only have access to nearby metro stations for shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

### International Response

American partners are taking the potential threat of an exchange of nuclear strikes extremely seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. As a measure to avoid provocation, the United States has cancelled the training firing of intercontinental ballistic missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. Furthermore, US intelligence services recently held a closed briefing for congressmen that dedicated a significant portion to the mental state of the Russian Federation's president, including discussions on the possibility of Russia using [[discussion_of_nuclear_weapons_usage | nuclear weapons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

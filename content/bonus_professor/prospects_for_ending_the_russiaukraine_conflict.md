## Possibility of Unilateral Action
According to the speaker, Russia is not formally in a state of war, but rather engaged in a "special military operation" or "intense military action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. While it is possible to unilaterally cease fire, this cannot last long if the other side does not share the same desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. A ceasefire is the first step, but without the other side's support, stopping military actions unilaterally is "practically impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

## Path to Peace
The speaker believes that a "peaceful track," or a truce, will be entered next year, though it may not be a lasting final peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. This falls under the broader category of [[prospects_of_a_truce_and_peace_negotiations_in_russian_military_conflicts | prospects of a truce and peace negotiations]].

## Proposals for Settlement
A plan for [[consultations_and_proposals_for_resolving_the_ukraine_conflict | resolving the Ukraine conflict]] was mentioned, which was initially attributed to Arestovich but clarified as the "Kissinger plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. This plan suggests Ukraine becoming a member of NATO without the territories currently occupied by Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

> [!info] The Kissinger Plan
> This [[proposal_for_peace_deal_between_russia_and_ukraine | proposal for a peace deal]] is supported by figures such as the former NATO Secretary General and influential Western officials, both retired and current <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.

The feasibility of this plan, however, depends on the political will of Ukraine and the support of Ukrainian society, which the speaker notes is currently lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. Therefore, at the present time, it is not considered feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. The general discussions surrounding these topics are part of the ongoing [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace proposals and negotiations between Russia and Ukraine]].

## Reparations and Compensation
The question of reparations for Ukraine is addressed. The speaker states that reparations, being a consequence of capitulation, will "never be a problem for any Russian government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>. It is deemed impossible to imagine a situation where Russia would capitulate in military actions against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:00">[25:05:00]</a>. However, "voluntary compensation" is considered a "completely natural thing" that is "absolutely natural and necessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:00">[25:15:00]</a>. This contributes to the broader [[prospects_of_peace_and_territorial_disputes_in_russia | prospects of peace and territorial disputes]].

## Political Landscape
The speaker predicts the emergence of a politician in a post-Putin state who might be similar to Willy Brandt, suggesting a high probability of such a figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:24:00">[25:24:00]</a>. This would certainly impact the [[russia_and_ukraine_conflict_dynamics | Russia and Ukraine conflict dynamics]] and [[western_calls_for_peace_in_the_russianukrainian_conflict | Western calls for peace]].

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The current situation in Russia, including [[geopolitical_consequences_and_crisis_predictions_in_russia | the situation in the country]], is aggravated by the place and significance of the main "demiurge," [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Vladimir Putin]], who was soon to turn 68 years old at the time of this broadcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Discussions constantly revolve around the fear of [[possibility_of_putins_death_and_its_implications | his death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Occult Hobbies in Russian Elite
There is a notable increase in the occult component within the current Russian government, which is not merely a hobby but involves significant financial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This is linked to desires to prolong life, be healed, or gain benefits in the afterlife, possibly for [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin himself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The Russian elite is actively engaging in occult and pseudo-occult practices, driven by a general atmosphere of anxiety and a belief in the need for "miracles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.

### Pyramids Near Tomsk
A group of businessmen, possibly connected to [[potential_return_of_prigozhin_and_speculation_on_putins_death | Prigozhin's businessmen]], are building pyramids near Tomsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The architect, Valery Uvarov, also designed a spa and salon in St. Petersburg, whose owner was reportedly connected to Prigozhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. These objects, photos of which are available online, are seen as a symptom of Egyptian-themed occult hobbies among the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

The choice of Tomsk is linked to an archaeological expedition in the late 1980s that discovered a Bronze Age complex with disturbed graves containing inventory items related to ancient Egyptian culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. While trade routes explain the presence of these items, the symbolism is noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

The purpose of these pyramids in the Tomsk region is interpreted in two ways:
1.  As tombs, implying someone wishes for someone else to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
2.  As objects endowed with mystical power, aligned with Russian black ideas about pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. In this context, a pyramid could have political subjects at the top, "shamans" (former Soviet workers) in the middle, and folk doctors like Malakhov at the bottom for prolonging life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

An example given is a farmer in Southern Russia who built a large pyramid on his field, claiming it cured his diseases, increased his cattle, and improved crop yields, but then went bankrupt a couple of years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## [[Putins_health_and_its_influence_on_russian_politics | Putin's Personal Occult Practices]]

### Non-Christian Rites
In April of the year of the broadcast, [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Vladimir Putin]] reportedly performed strange, non-Christian rites with an elder named Nikifor (a pseudonym), who is described as a "Valdai elder" living near the Novospassky monastery in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. These rituals were for [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin's health]] and protection, as well as for inducing harm and evil on his enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Such practices are not accepted among Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Other episodes involved people from different belief systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

### Three Predictions
Early in [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | his leadership]], after a year or two, [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin]] reportedly sought out three fortune tellers to learn his future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. These three predictions were almost identical, despite coming from different, unknown sources (at least two outside Russia) and delivered by different special services officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

The essence of the predictions was that [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin]] would rule for 20 years, but the end of his reign would be "terrible" if he could not "change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This message was described as extensive and not veiled, containing allegories easily readable as real events in Russian politics, such as references to Georgia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

Intriguingly, all three predictions were delivered without the final paragraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This missing paragraph contained phrases like: "all twelve turn away from you" and "be afraid of part of the southern ruler of poisons, husband of the state southern ruler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. The "southern rulers" are interpreted to be figures like Milosevic, Mubarak, and Gaddafi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

The importance of these predictions lies in how they were perceived and used as a guide by those who sought them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. The fact that the 20th anniversary of [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin's reign]] was approaching, coupled with attempts to "deceive history" or "challenge fate," suggests these predictions are a hidden driver of Russian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

## Decline of Luck and Elite Anxiety
The increase in occult practices is linked to the cyclical end of the 20-year period from the predictions and [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin's fading age]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. There is a sense of "esoteric fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

### Loss of Putin's Luck
Since August 2020 (specifically after August 9-10 and the start of the Belarus revolution), there's a perceived exhaustion of [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin's luck]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. The influence of Russia in regions like the greater South Caucasus is seen to be falling apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

Those traditionally close to [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin]] now complain about the impossibility of meeting him, which frightens them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This creates extreme nervousness and a sense of panic within the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. They previously held an "almost mystical belief" in [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin's luck]], believing he would always cope and outwit everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. However, in the past year, they have stopped saying this, acknowledging that "luck is lost" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

### Irrationality and "Miracle" Seeking
For [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin]], the indefinite quarantine and unprecedented isolation measures are seen as a sign of personal circumstances of "force majeure," specifically the fear of a tragic outcome from infection, especially coronavirus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>. As a rationalist, [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin]] begins to seek a "miracle" in irrational manifestations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

While [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin]] is not considered a religious person in the classical sense, his visits to Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) objects are seen as protocol events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. The majority of the integrated elite share this view, not excluding the mystical element but treating it as a "miracle" rather than faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. Christianity for them is viewed as a "religion of the flesh" rather than the spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.

### Exploitation of Relics
[[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin]], being from the KGB, knows the ROC system from the inside and has no illusions, yet he does not reject relics as a "main attribute of the miracle of the ROC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Human remains have been ruthlessly exploited by religious cults since ancient times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

Examples of deception given include:
*   Two heads of John Chrysostom existing in different locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
*   The mummified corpse of a circumcised person being passed off as the relics of Saint Alexander of Svir, who died 500 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

There's a trade in human remains, with "diggers" being the lowest level of intermediaries, while higher up are "cynical, educated people" with academic degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>. One recent example involved a skeleton designated as the remains of a "Byzantine king," a "great warrior, sage, and merciful" figure, intended to arrange an altar for Santa Muerte (Santa Marta) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

These remains are purchased for significant sums of money, up to 250-300 thousand American dollars, by officials who view it as an "insignificant" amount to acquire an "attribute of miracle" and gain "unthinkable benefits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

### Santa Muerte Cult
Santa Muerte is a syncretic Mexican cult combining elements of Christianity and traditional Mexican beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. Its altar basis requires a skeleton or skull, ideally belonging to a "powerful person" like a general; a "fool's" remains would yield a "stupid" result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. Significant graves in Central and South America have been dug up, their contents moved to Santa Muerte altars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

There are three varieties of the cult:
*   **Black Death:** For career growth and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.
*   **Golden Death:** For becoming very rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>.
*   **White Death:** For worldly goods like love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

This cult is very widespread in Mexico and northern South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. Adherents, even devout Catholics, engage in these practices, reflecting a similar syncretic approach in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

## Elite Psychology and Imitation
The Russian elite's engagement in these practices is seen as an imitation of [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | the first overlord]], [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin]], who sets the fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. This includes public figures like Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, former head of Kalmykia and FIDE, who openly discusses his encounter with aliens in an interplanetary ship in September 1997, witnessed by his driver and assistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>. This "cult of Sirius" is believed to be used by Ilyumzhinov and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.

The prevalence of mystical, quasi-esoteric, and pseudo-occult moods in Russia is described as "much worse" than during the end of the Russian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>. These moods are strong across almost all groups within the establishment, with each group having its own "fashion" or "passion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

Past trends include seeking Shambhala, turning to Orthodox elders (including Polonsky elder), and then to shamans from various regions, including Khakassia, Tula, Altai Mountains, and even from the zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. There is a sharp demand for esotericism and occultism, especially since 2014-2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | The leader's]] style sets the fashion, and elites choose exotic cults or fashionable shamans/fortune tellers (e.g., tarot card readers, astrologers) to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>.

The market for quasi-occult and pseudo-esoteric services is thriving, with intermediaries earning hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. Magicians are often prepared before meetings, told what clients want to hear, leading to biased confirmation and adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. When traditional political and economic instruments fail to change reality, the elite turns to "magical instruments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.

## External Influences: World Occult Orders
A significant part of the Russian population, including almost all FSB officers and a substantial portion of the financial elite, believes in a "world government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>. They cannot believe in world chaos and seek a "secret chancery" or competing chanceries that rule the world, as depicted in Pelevin's novels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

There are no direct contacts between the Kremlin and the 13 great world occult orders due to "insurmountable contradictions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. This conflict stemmed from an "unsuccessful joke" from the Russian side, perceived as an insult by the great master of the 13 orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.

### Rituals and Consequences
A ritual initiated by the 13 great world occult orders was held on June 21 (summer solstice) by authentic shamans in the Ligand Gorge in Nepal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>. This event is seen as a turning point, after which things "changed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>.

The "factory of luck" for the Russian government, particularly [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin's luck]], completely disappeared after August 9, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. Militaristic rhetoric also vanished, despite previous discussions of small victorious wars to boost ratings (e.g., taking Narva, Kherson, or northern Kazakhstan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.

These orders or "non-public organizations" operate through people and have influence within the Russian government and Western governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:41">[00:54:41]</a>. They are credited with delivering "sensitive slaps on the nose" to the Russian government through Western media campaigns and strong statements from Western leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>. They act as political subjects and are influential despite not seeking publicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>.

Their core principles include freedom, enlightenment, and free knowledge without censorship, which are completely rejected by the Russian establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. The 13 orders' structure includes political, economic, scientific research, and metaphysical components, with the conflict primarily being political <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.

The current turbulence in Russia has led to a great demand for "miracles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>. The Russian establishment longs for a miracle where [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin]] leaves, and everything remains as it was, or for [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin]] to "outwit history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. However, it is believed he will not succeed, and the situation is approaching a "fatal line" where everything will collapse very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:31">[00:59:31]</a>. This brings a feeling of deep fear and impending collapse among the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.

## Russia in the "New Middle Ages"
Russia is described as living in a "new Middle Ages" where people use poisons, the government participates in "dense black magic rituals," and worships the remains of the dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. This fits into the contemporary understanding of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:36">[01:09:36]</a>. It is suggested that there is only a very short period left for this "new Middle Ages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>.

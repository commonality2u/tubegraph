## Context of Aid

A question was posed regarding the recent adoption of a bill by the U.S. to provide [[military_aid_and_strategy_in_the_ukrainian_conflict | assistance to Ukraine]], noting a previous understanding that the U.S. was reluctant to do so due to fears of a nuclear strike from the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Speaker's Clarification on Previous Statements

The speaker clarified that they consistently reported the U.S. was "slow in providing assistance to Ukraine" but always "emphasized that this assistance will still be provided, this decision will be made" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The main concern was whether the aid would arrive "too late for Ukraine to have time to effectively resist the armed forces of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The speaker stated that this time, the assistance arrived "almost on time or really on time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

It was emphasized that the speaker "never said that the US is not ready to provide assistance to Ukraine at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Instead, the U.S. intended to provide aid "so that the Russian Federation does not defeat Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The overall aim for the U.S. and the West is to prevent the victory of the Russian Federation over Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. The speaker expressed disappointment that their words are often distorted or misattributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Implications for International Relations

Regarding the broader [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_international_relations | relations with the West]], a fundamental condition for their restoration is a peace treaty or a truce with Ukraine, followed by a full peace treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:30">[00:29:30]</a>. This treaty must "more or less meet both Ukraine's expectations and the West's expectations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. Without fulfilling this precondition, there will be no restoration of relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

If this condition is met, relations with the West could be restored "fairly quickly," potentially within "several years, perhaps 2-3 years," reaching an almost full restoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

### Prospects for Russian Influence
The speaker noted that the current prospects for Russia's geopolitical influence in Europe and Central Asia are "not very significant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. However, with a new Russian government and the fulfillment of the aforementioned conditions for peace with Ukraine, Russia could "very intensively build a new paradigm of relations with the world and with itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

### Global Power Dynamics
The United States is expected to "certainly remain a hegemon," despite facing an increasing wave of problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.

### End of Hostilities
There are "serious reasons" to believe that by the end of the year, there will be a move towards peace negotiations or a truce, if not a full peace treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>. This outcome is considered "very, very likely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.

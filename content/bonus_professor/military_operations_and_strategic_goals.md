The special military operation has transitioned into a positional phase, characterized by skirmishes with limited advancement and stubborn battles for populated areas [00:00:39]. Unlike the large-scale operations of 1943, there are no tank breakthroughs, "cauldrons," or envelopments [00:00:49].

## Strategic Intentions and Resources

Both the Russian and Ukrainian sides maintain the intention of achieving a strategic turning point in the conflict [00:01:17]. For Ukraine, this intention is supported by its Western allies [00:01:25].

### Ukrainian Resources
Ukraine is not expected to face a shortage of military and technical resources due to an uninterrupted supply line largely provided by its allies [00:01:36]. The country also possesses significant moral, psychological, and societal resources, alongside the ability of its armed forces to resist skillfully and potentially launch a counteroffensive [00:01:50].

### Russian Military Policy and Goals
Russian military policy initially aimed to exhaust Ukraine's resources and demoralize Ukrainian society to compel a peace treaty on Russian terms [00:02:12]. However, this objective has not been achieved, and the strategic turning point remains elusive [00:02:44].

Unlike Ukraine, Russia has limited military resources and does not receive external military aid [00:03:04]. There are also questions regarding the moral-political and moral-psychological state of the Russian armed forces and society [00:03:12].

#### Evolving Strategic Goals
The stated goals of the operation have been revised multiple times [00:03:25]:
*   **Initial Goals:** Denazification and demilitarization of Ukraine, implying complete political control by the Russian Federation and a change of power [00:03:38].
*   **Current/More Modest Goals:** Complete control of Donbass, the Azov coast, and apparently the Black Sea coast [00:03:49]. Control of the Azov coast is largely achieved, but implementation for the Black Sea coast has not yet begun [00:04:00].

Some high-ranking Russian military leaders, including a General Staff General, express doubt that even the limited goals of the second stage of the special operation can be achieved [00:04:19].

## Tools for a Strategic Turning Point

To achieve a strategic turning point, two primary tools are considered:
1.  **Human Mass:** Involving [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_Russia | mobilization]] of human resources to overwhelm Ukrainian forces [00:04:41].
2.  **Tactical Nuclear Strikes:** Inflicting tactical nuclear strikes on Ukraine [00:04:53].

### [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_Russia | Mobilization]] in Russia
A decision regarding [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_Russia | mobilization]] has been made by the President of the Russian Federation, though the exact timing for its implementation remains uncertain [00:09:43]. The Security Council reports to Putin that from an organizational and technical standpoint, everything is ready for [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_Russia | mobilization]], with no anticipated negative political consequences [00:05:23].

*   **Scope:** Plans involve mobilizing approximately half a million people in several stages (3-4 stages), potentially concluding with the first stage depending on public reaction [00:10:10].
*   **Methods:** Tools to motivate people to mobilize include military registration and enlistment office employees visiting homes (targeting those with military IDs aged 17-50) [00:10:25], blocking bank cards of those subject to [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_Russia | mobilization]] [00:10:47], and closing borders for them [00:10:56].
*   **Justification:** Propaganda from the Supreme Authority would justify the need for [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_Russia | mobilization]] by portraying Ukraine as an existential threat to the Russian Federation [00:11:35]. Such justification might involve events like chemical attacks or terrorist acts in major Russian cities [00:12:03].
*   **Implications:** A public declaration of [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_Russia | mobilization]] would officially transfer the conflict's status from a "special military operation" to a full-fledged, large-scale war, potentially legitimizing the use of tactical nuclear weapons [00:12:36].

### Use of Tactical Nuclear Weapons
The possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons is considered legitimate if Ukraine is perceived to pose an existential threat to the Russian Federation [00:12:51]. This threat, the Kremlin might argue, must be destroyed, and the world would supposedly be grateful [00:13:02]. The speaker notes that accepting "other forms of thinking" is necessary, as the decision-making logic of those in power may differ fundamentally from common understanding [00:15:33].

## Internal Climate in Russia
The atmosphere in the Russian Federation is characterized by despair and anger, not only among the general populace but also at the top levels of government [00:17:20]. This is evidenced by "hysterical statements" from public figures and ministers [00:16:33].

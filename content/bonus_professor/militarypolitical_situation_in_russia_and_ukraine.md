The current [[militarypolitical_situation_in_ukraine_and_russia | military-political reality]] is identified as the root cause of increasing "clinical madness" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:12">[05:08:12]</a>, particularly concerning the [[military_and_nuclear_concerns_regarding_ukraine_and_russia | special military operation]] in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:23">[05:22:23]</a>.

## Challenges in Military-Political Goals
The [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | military-political goals]] of the operation are becoming increasingly difficult and problematic to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:27">[05:30:27]</a>. While some chances to achieve certain goals (though far from the original ones) still exist and are not zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:40">[05:40:40]</a>, the dynamics of [[russian_military_situation_and_challenges_in_ukraine | military actions]] and the [[military_dynamics_and_morale_in_the_russia_ukraine_conflict | moral-political state of the Russian Armed Forces]] are described as moving in a downward trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:01">[06:06:01]</a>. The prospect of victory is seen as a "ghost" that is dissolving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

## Blame and the "Enemies of the People"
In this context, the ingrained tendency in the [[economic_and_political_situation_in_russia | Russian Federation]] is to blame external factors or other people for mistakes and miscalculations, rather than self-admission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:08">[07:08:08]</a>. Since no one can challenge the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, the blame falls on "enemies of the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:10">[08:43:10]</a>.

President Putin stated that the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_international_relations | West]]'s primary task is to split Russian society and destroy the country from within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:45">[09:01:45]</a>. He also noted that "fakes and calls for illegal actions" are often organized from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:35">[09:12:35]</a>.

This leads to the identification of two categories of "enemies of the people" in the modern context:
1.  **Foreign agents**: People associated with the [[russiaukraine_conflict_and_international_relations | West]] who, with Western support, undermine stability and moral-political unity by spreading "fakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:30">[09:30:30]</a>.
2.  **Outright terrorists and saboteurs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:19">[10:17:19]</a>.

### Historical Analogies
This approach draws on two historical parallels:
*   **Weimar Germany**: The concept of "moral decay and national traitors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:35">[12:07:35]</a>, similar to the "stab-in-the-back" myth used to explain Germany's loss in World War I <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:05">[11:37:05]</a>. In modern Russia, foreign agents are seen as trying to "stick a knife in the back" of society and the armed forces through "fakes and the decomposition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:25">[12:42:25]</a>.
*   **Stalin's Russia**: The idea of direct terrorist activity, reminiscent of the Moscow trials of 1936-1938 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:07">[15:31:07]</a>. The alleged plot to murder TV presenter Vladimir Solovyov is presented as a modern parallel to the accusations made in those trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:25">[16:25:25]</a>.

### Future [[potential_political_and_military_developments_in_russia | Developments]]
The speaker anticipates public trials in Russia for foreign agents who engage in terrorist activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:13">[17:28:13]</a>. It is asserted that Russia is a country where historical tragedies repeat themselves as further tragedies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:04">[18:34:04]</a>. The "peak of the fight against very moral Chechen terrorists" and "exposing national traitors" is considered to be still ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>.

The current [[political_situation_in_russia | Russian reality]] is described as very difficult for those who retain a sense of morality, common sense, and dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:30">[19:15:30]</a>.

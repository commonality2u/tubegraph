The Kremlin's vision for peace with Ukraine was a significant topic following the US presidential elections, with specific proposals communicated through informal channels to Donald Trump. This perspective outlines the desired territorial outcomes and conditions for a truce, aiming to resolve what Russia refers to as an "incident" between the two nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Initial Overtures to the US
Following the US presidential elections on November 6, two Russian elite coalitions, one led by Chemezov and the other by Patrushev, sent enthusiastic congratulations to Donald Trump through informal channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Trump responded to these messages on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. His response referred to the situation between Russia and Ukraine as an "incident" that it was time to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Proposal for a Truce
Within at least one of these messages, a proposal was made not for immediate peace, but for a truce, seen as a preliminary and necessary stage for the beginning of peace negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Kremlin's Vision for Peace Contours
The Kremlin's specific vision for the contours of peace includes several key territorial demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>:
*   **Crimea:** Is to remain on the Russian side as a "sine qua non" condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Donetsk and Luhansk Regions:** Are to remain on the Russian side within their administrative borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Territorial Exchange:** Russia would give up fragments of territories it controls in the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. In exchange, Ukraine would relinquish control of the Kursk region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

> [!note] Shift on Land Corridor to Crimea
> During previous consultations between the Russian and Ukrainian sides (ongoing since late August through intermediaries and directly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, the Russian side had insisted on retaining a land corridor to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. However, during the recent conversation with Trump, the Kremlin stepped back from this demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This concession was made on the condition that the Ukrainian side guarantees unimpeded transit of goods and people from mainland Russia to the Crimean peninsula through Ukrainian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. This represents a potential [[Kremlins Strategy and Negotiations | strategic shift]] in the Kremlin's negotiating position.

## US Reaction and Internal Considerations
Trump paused at these proposals, stating he could not comment off the cuff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. The leak of information about this conversation, which is considered an authorized leak, suggests that some individuals in Trump's circle are not entirely satisfied with these proposals, evaluating them as unrealistic and undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### The Role of the "Deep State"
Despite the significant powers of the American president, they are not absolute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Even with his party controlling Congress and the Supreme Court, the president is not a dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Trump would need to contend with his own party officials who may have different views on the [[Ukraine Russia peace talks and territorial integrity | confrontation between Russia and Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Key positions such as the Secretary of State and Assistant to the President for National Security are crucial in shaping the approach to resolving the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The "Deep State," referring to the Washington bureaucracy, previously blocked a number of Trump's initiatives and decisions in his first term (2016-2020) that it deemed detrimental or dangerous to the US role in international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This influence remains, indicating potential challenges to any peace initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

## Russia's Internal Context
During the period of these discussions, the individual presenting himself as the "President of Russia" at the Valdai Forum (identified by the speaker as a "double" of Evgeny Vasilyevich) delivered an hour-long speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This speech reportedly contained 44 mistakes, including mispronounced or repeated words, and long pauses, which are attributed to the speaker's perceived lack of education and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. The speaker suggests that the "Politburo 2" has decided to end this individual's role as president of Russia, leading to concerns for his future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

The plans of the Russian elite for the coming months and the next six months were discussed in a separate online meeting on November 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

The introduction of a ceiling on oil prices is a significant economic and political event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The full consequences of this measure are not expected to be seen until January or February, but initial assessments suggest they may not be as dramatic as some predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## The Oil Price Ceiling

The ceiling, set by Canada, Australia, the EU, and G7 countries, is fixed at $60 per barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. This price is considered "comfortable" for Russia, as oil sold from the port of Primorsk in the last week of November was already priced at $52 per barrel, $8 below the ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This means the $60 ceiling itself is not inherently unprofitable for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

## Russia's Response and Export Challenges

Despite the relatively comfortable ceiling, the Russian leadership has stated that Russia will not supply oil to countries that have adopted these restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This decision is seen as self-sabotaging, given that 47% of all Russia's oil exports typically go to EU countries, with Hungary being the only exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

It is anticipated that oil will still reach Europe through third countries, involving transshipment in the open sea and delivery under foreign flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. Russia has reportedly purchased 100 tankers, supposedly for delivery to China, India, and other Asian countries, but their ultimate destinations remain to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

The European Union is introducing a law with a five-year punishment term for those who help Russia circumvent sanctions, acknowledging that many might be tempted to profit from discounted oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

## OPEC's Role and Market Impact

A critical factor in the market outlook is OPEC's decision regarding oil production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. If the US can pressure oil-exporting countries to increase production, raw material prices will not rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. However, if OPEC refuses to increase production, Russia could compensate for its losses in European oil exports by increasing the cost of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

## Consequences for Russia's Economy

Regardless of market dynamics, the Russian budget is expected to suffer losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. These losses will likely impact the replenishment of the reserve fund, leading to budget rules not being strictly implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. A decrease in foreign exchange earnings will likely lead to the "printing press" being spun up in the Russian Federation, accelerating inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

These [[economic_challenges_in_russia | economic challenges]] contribute to the broader [[economic_and_social_consequences_in_russia | economic and social consequences in Russia]], as the official rhetoric about positive trends in poverty reduction is contradicted by rising microcredit defaults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The Russian economy is projected by the chief economist of the US State Department, Emily Blanchard, to fall by at least 20% over the next 8-10 years, suggesting a "stable decline and degradation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This situation is compared to the [[economic_challenges_in_russia | Iranian economy]], which also experienced a gloomy stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

Valery Solovey, speaking on the 124th episode of "What is Happening," discussed the visit of the "so-called president so-called Putin," referred to as a "double Evgeny Vasilyevich," to Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This visit, which occurred in the week leading up to May 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, was presented as a critical event for the [[russian_political_system_and_leadership | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## Purpose of the Visit

The main purpose of the visit, according to Solovey, was for the "Moscow prince" to "receive a label for reigning" from the "Chinese Bogdykhan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This act was seen as an attempt to achieve "legitimization of a double," with the hope that if China accepted him as president, the rest of the world would eventually follow suit or at least not shun him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Solovey asserts that "real masters of Russia" sent him to Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Moscow's Stated Goals

Beyond legitimization, the Kremlin aimed to achieve several other goals during the trip:
*   **Influence on Ukraine Summit:** Ask China to pressure Russia to prevent its participation in the "Tsarist summit on Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Continued Military Support:** Obtain guarantees of continued Chinese support for military operations against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Solovey notes that China's support for dual-use products is "critically important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>; without it, Russian military actions would subside within months, and the Russian economy might not last longer than six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Banking Issues:** Resolve issues with bank payments stuck or returned by Chinese banks, which significantly slows down and reduces mutual trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Energy Projects:** Obtain China's consent to build the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Beijing's Goals

Beijing had two primary goals for the visit:
*   **Assess New Leadership:** Observe the "so-called new composition of the Russian leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Secret Agreement:** Understand Moscow's readiness to fulfill a secret agreement signed by the "late Russian President Vladimir Putin" with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in February 2022, on the eve of the Beijing Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
    *   This agreement grants China a 49-year lease of "gigantic territories" in Siberia and the Far East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. China would have the right to develop natural resources and organize its own administration in these territories, effectively taking them out of the [[the_legitimacy_of_russian_leadership_and_laws | jurisdiction of the Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Solovey describes this as an "act of national treason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   The treaty was meant to come into effect on January 1, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   The Kremlin sought to postpone the treaty's effect due to fears of a "monstrous scandal and domestic political crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The Chinese had not yet decided on this request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## Outcomes and Observations

The visit was characterized by [[chinese_influence_on_russian_politics | Chinese dominance]] and a "humiliating situation" for the Russian delegation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. China was seen as a "master looking down" on Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Key figures like Sergei Chemezov and Nikolai Patrushev reportedly did not go to Beijing to avoid being part of the humiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Humiliation and Control

*   **"Pathetic Puppet":** The "so-called Putin" was treated like a "pathetic doll of a pathetic Puppet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Controlled Meeting:** The "one-on-one meeting" with Xi Jinping was not truly private; it included a translator and "people who controlled the double from the Russian side" to prevent him from saying anything "unnecessary" or "idiocy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **Delegation Restrictions:** Some members of the Russian delegation were denied access to toilets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   **Symbolic Agreements:** While some agreements were signed, they were deemed "not very significant but very important from a symbolic point of view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. An agreement on cooperation on Bolshoy Usuriysky Island was noted, where China considers the island entirely its own, as indicated on Chinese maps, and Russia does not protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This is seen as a hint that the Kremlin is ready to implement the secret agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **No Concrete Outcomes:** China did not agree to any "important issue" from Russia's side, including bank payments or the Power of Siberia gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   **Ukraine Summit Decision:** After the meeting, China stated they would send a delegation to the Swiss summit on Ukraine, contrary to one of Russia's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Limited Legitimization:** The meeting's primary outcome was "some very modest legitimization of the double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, which Solovey considers "offensive to Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

### [[Russian internal political dynamics and leadership issues | Russian Political Dynamics]]

The Chinese showed interest in Belousov, seeing him as a potential "new strong man of the Russian government," indicating their desire to find a reliable counterparty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Belousov's appointment was described as the result of a "fantastic coincidence" or "skillfully conducted intrigues," revealing a "new alignment within Russian politics" and a new "elite balance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

### Conclusion

Solovey concludes that the outcome of the visit is "frankly dangerous for Russia" because the "territorial integrity and national sovereignty of the [[russian_political_system_and_leadership | Russian Federation]] have been called into question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a> due to the secret treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. He further predicts the imminent resignation of Mishustin and a "radical renewal of the Cabinet of Ministers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

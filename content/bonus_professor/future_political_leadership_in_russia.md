The political landscape in Russia is characterized by increasing turbulence, particularly concerning the formation of the new government and the struggle for influence among elite groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Predictions about recent government changes have been accurate by 85-90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

## Key Coalitions and Their Influence

Domestic Russian politics are largely defined by the conflict between two primary coalitions:
*   The **Chemezov coalition** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>
*   The **Patrushev coalition** (headed by Nikolai Patrushev) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>

These coalitions are opposing forces, and their conflict will shape the main content of [[future_political_changes_in_russia | domestic Russian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

## Prime Ministerial Succession

The appointment of Mr. Mishustin as Prime Minister was not predetermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. The process was a result of an intense and sharp struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

### Initial Plans (November - Mid-February)
From late November until mid-February, an agreement was in place for Dmitry Patrushev to become prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This scenario anticipated a radical renewal of the government by 75-80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Dmitry Patrushev was also considered the heir to the so-called "President Putin" (described as a double, Yevgeny Vasilyevich, a carpenter from Mogilev) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Resistance and Stalemate
By mid-February, the Patrushev coalition's plans faced strong, seemingly insurmountable resistance from the Chemezov coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The Chemezov coalition categorically opposed Dmitry Patrushev becoming Prime Minister and eventually President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This led to a political stalemate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>:
*   **Patrushev coalition candidate:** Dmitry Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>
*   **Chemezov coalition candidate:** Denis Manturov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>

### Compromise Options
Several compromise candidates were considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>:
*   **Anton Vaina:** Head of the presidential administration, who refused the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Security official:** A second compromise candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Alexey Dyumin:** Appeared as a candidate in the last days of April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. His candidacy was considered for a short time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

### China's Role in Mishustin's Appointment
China advocated for Mishustin to become Prime Minister because he personally appealed to Xi Jinping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Mishustin promised to fulfill all obligations to China assumed by the "late President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. China's condition for agreeing to the visit of the "so-called president" (double) to Beijing in mid-May was Mishustin's appointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This Chinese influence is a significant source of internal tension within the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

## The "Rotten Compromise" and Future Prospects

The current political arrangement is described as a "rotten compromise" that no one considers long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

### Terms of the Compromise
1.  **Vice-Premiers:** Denis Manturov (from the Chemezov coalition) became First Vice-Premier, and Dmitry Patrushev (from the Patrushev coalition) became a Vice-Premier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Their apparatus weight increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
2.  **Dmitry Patrushev's Future:** Nikolai Patrushev was promised that Dmitry Patrushev would become the new prime minister by the end of this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. His transformation into president is expected by early next year (winter/spring), rather than the fall of 2024 as initially assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
3.  **Nikolai Patrushev's Role:** He "removed himself" from the post of Secretary of the Security Council, but this was a strategic move to "go into the shadows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. He maintains control over the security forces from behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The official position (e.g., Security Council Secretary) is less important than the individual's real weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.
4.  **Shoigu's Replacement:** The high probability of Shoigu's removal as Minister of Defense was known, but the successor (Belousov) was not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. A near-complete purge of his deputies is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

## Instability and Future Challenges

The current compromise is fragile, and the [[russia_internal_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | internal tension within the Russian elite]], particularly between the two coalitions, is expected to intensify and be "discharged" soon, potentially with bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. The political landscape is expected to become sharply turbulent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

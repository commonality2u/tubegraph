This article outlines expected [[political_changes_in_russia_post_putin | political changes]] in Russia and their potential impacts, as discussed by Valery Solovey.

## Anticipated Political Crisis and Government Change
A political crisis is expected to unfold in Russia, with major events predicted for the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. This crisis involves a radical change of power, not merely a transfer within the current regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. The speaker's non-public teams have developed strategies for various scenarios of this unfolding situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, and they hope for societal participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

### Key Drivers of Change
*   **Military Defeats:** Military defeats are seen as factors that increase political tension and deepen the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. However, significant victories or crushing defeats for Russia are not anticipated in December or the next year, with the status quo at the front expected to be maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   **Change of Leadership:** The death of Putin is considered the "beginning of the opening of a chance" for [[political_changes_in_russias_political_landscape | Russia's future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. The speaker consistently stated that nothing would automatically change for the better with Putin's death; instead, it would usher in difficult times, lasting months rather than years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. The political elite, including Patrushev, are aware of Putin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>, and they control the timing of any official announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. The body can be stored for a very long time, possibly over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.
*   **Elite Actions:** Elite groups, separated during the redistribution of power, are expected to act, potentially to discredit future elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:25:00">[33:25:00]</a>. However, their timing is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36:00">[33:36:00]</a>.

## Societal and Governmental Reforms

### Judicial and Security Agencies
The judicial system requires a thorough cleaning and full lustration without exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. Corrupt security agencies also need a comprehensive purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. These changes are realistically planned to take about two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

### Local Governance and Economy
To address issues in regions, two main levers are proposed:
1.  **Central Government Reform:** A change in the framework and climate of the state, led by people who prioritize justice and hold officials accountable, including putting "friends in jail" if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. This includes simplifying legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.
2.  **Regional Empowerment:** Climate change in the regions themselves, giving people confidence they can influence their destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. This means developing local government with more powers and financial support, transitioning to budgetary federalism where regions retain a significant portion of their generated funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.

### Elections and Accountability
The upcoming presidential elections are expected to be a "farce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. Lustration of election commissions is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>, focusing on commission heads and active accomplices of voting fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>. The idea of "qualified voters" paying for the right to vote is suggested to increase voter responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>.

### Public Psychology and Dignity
The goal is to provide people with the opportunity to rid themselves of a "lackey" or "obsequious" psychology by changing the legal, political, and economic frameworks to prioritize human dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>. The hope is to rid younger generations of this need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:50:00">[23:50:00]</a>.

## External Relations and Domestic Impacts

### Lukashenko's Fate
Once the government in Russia radically changes, Belarusian President Lukashenko will not last long at the head of Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. His individual political fate is tied to events in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Patrushev, while not openly quarreling with Lukashenko now due to focusing on consolidating power on external tracks, views him with "bad irritation and disbelief" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### Geopolitical Stances
*   **Ukraine:** Ukraine is expected to remain an independent, sovereign state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:49:00">[33:49:00]</a>.
*   **Baltic Countries:** The government dissolution in early 2020 (Mishustin replacing Medvedev) was directly connected to plans for a "massive hybrid operation" against the Baltic countries in March 2020, not Ukraine at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
*   **Kaliningrad Region:** The Kaliningrad region is not threatened and will remain part of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:32:00">[28:32:00]</a>. There is no threat of its exit from Russia or the collapse of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45:00">[28:45:00]</a>.
*   **NATO:** It is possible to explain to Russians that NATO does not threaten them, and that it has never started a war against the Soviet Union or Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>, especially if propaganda changes its narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.
*   **Iran:** When Iran approaches acquiring nuclear weapons, Israel and the United States will take preventive measures due to the immediate threat to Israel's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.

### Social and Economic Impacts
*   **Migration:** For those unwilling to participate in the political struggle or doubting the country's ability to change, an exit strategy through migration is advised, especially for young people who can adapt more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   **Food Security:** There will be no famine in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>. While some supply interruptions are possible if the political crisis takes acute forms, especially in the capital and a few other cities, these will be short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19:00">[24:19:00]</a>. People are advised to stock up on a week or two's worth of provisions, drinking water, batteries for charging devices, and cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Money and Social Rating:** Digital money is viewed positively for financing budgetary organizations due to the transparency it provides in tracking funds, which can help clean up corrupt offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:30:00">[27:30:00]</a>. However, the speaker is against its use in settlements between citizens and the state, as it represents "excessive control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a>. Social ratings are rejected as a concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:22:00">[27:22:00]</a>.
*   **LGBT Persecution:** While the speaker believes poverty, lawlessness, and the impudence of power are the real problems, not issues of sexual orientation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48:00">[29:48:00]</a>, problems may arise for LGBT individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:18:00">[34:18:00]</a>. There are concerns about targeted persecution and the random snatching of people, including those who differ in appearance, who might be accused of spreading extremist ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:25:00">[34:25:00]</a>.
*   **Renaming Streets and Dismantling Monuments:** The speaker supports renaming streets and dismantling monuments to historical figures responsible for atrocities, but believes this decision should primarily be left to local communities via referendums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

## Role of Security Agencies
The speaker states that the KGB (now FSB) and other security forces are effectively the "political authority" in Russia, which is unique globally and has led to negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>. This is attributed not to evil intent, but to "built-in defects of their thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.

## Evidence of Putin's Doubles
Studies on the presence of Putin's doubles have been conducted, including in Britain, with phonoscopic examinations. An expert concluded with 99% accuracy that the Putin who spoke on May 9, 2022, and the "Putin" who spoke at the World Russian People's Council in November are different people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a>. It is asserted that "Putin's double Vasilich" spoke at the council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>. Further investigations by British journalists have also supported these claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
The speaker emphasizes that a significant chance for [[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | positive change]] exists and encourages participation, including financial support, to realize this opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:53:00">[36:53:00]</a>.

Valery Solovey, in the 54th episode of "What's Happening" recorded on March 12th, 2023, discusses the end of the Russian army's winter offensive, [[putins_leadership_and_political_influence | Putin's leadership]] challenges, and the potential for [[potential_changes_in_russian_leadership_and_implications | leadership changes]] within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Key topics include the military situation, [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin's health and political future]], China's role, and [[internal_political_dynamics_and_challenges_in_russia | internal political dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## End of the Winter Offensive

The winter campaign, or "grand offensive," of the Russian armed forces on Ukrainian fronts has ended "ingloriously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The bloody storming of Bakhmut is an exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner PMC, has openly complained about the lack of shells and high losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Other experts, including Igor Strelkov, stated that the winter campaign ended "without result," and Russia must now anticipate the enemy's next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

It is suggested that the offensive was largely an "imitation" designed to appease the supreme commander-in-chief, [[putins_leadership_and_political_influence | Vladimir Putin]], by showing progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Advances were minimal, often "meter by meter," or nonexistent in most directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. General Gerasimov, described as a highly intelligent and capable commander, understands that a Ukrainian counteroffensive is likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. To prepare, Russia is building a defense line, previously called the Surovikino line and now potentially the Gerasimov line, using mobilized troops to dig trenches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The aim is to hold the line, preserve equipment, accumulate shells, and protect the professional army, hoping for negotiations once neither side can inflict a decisive defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Putin's Last Hope: China

[[putins_leadership_and_political_influence | Vladimir Putin]], as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, is banking on China's support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Significant effort has been made to secure a visit from a Chinese comrade to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. For Putin, a visit by the head of a superpower like China offers a symbolic political victory, demonstrating Russia is "in business" and he is not in international isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. He also hopes to receive weapons and ammunition from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

However, China has not supplied military products, causing "frustration and strong indignation" among the [[russian_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Russian political leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. China's interest is to see Russia become a sphere of influence, which requires Russia to be sufficiently weakened by armed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. From China's perspective, supplying arms would further antagonize the United States without serving its strategic interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### China's View of Putin

Rumors suggest China views [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Vladimir Putin]] as a "toxic asset" for Russia and believes the [[potential_changes_in_russian_leadership_and_implications | Russian leadership needs a personnel renewal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. China questions whether Putin, unable to win the war or agree to peace, should consider "changing the leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. It is suggested that China may directly or indirectly hint that it is "time for you to go on a well-deserved rest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

This marks a significant shift, as China has begun to doubt if [[putins_leadership_and_political_influence | Putin is the guarantor of Russia's stability]] and its interests in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. There are likely individuals ready to promise better stability and a stronger alignment with China's interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Internal Political Struggles

Symptoms of an [[internal_political_dynamics_and_challenges_in_russia | under-the-carpet political struggle]] are emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Beyond the well-known ambitions of Yevgeny Prigozhin and his Wagner forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, there are reports of health problems among high-ranking leaders. One leader from a North Caucasian republic is believed to have been poisoned or "exposed to external influence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Similar external influences are suspected for "at least 2-3 high-ranking leaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The urgent evacuation of a famous cellist to Germany for treatment is also cited as a potential "symptom" of this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. These incidents suggest a deliberate "operation" by an undisclosed force, preparing the stage for future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

## Opposition Conflicts and Beneficiaries

A widely discussed conflict within the liberal opposition involves figures like Navalny's team (Volkov) and A. Venediktov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. The speaker refuses to comment on individuals in the opposition, believing they are "on the same side of the barricade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Such internal squabbling is deemed pointless and counterproductive, only harming the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

Quoting Mark Aldanov, who wrote that if communists hated the bourgeoisie as much as they hated each other, they would have achieved world revolution, the speaker states that if the Russian opposition truly fought the regime, they would have a chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

This internal conflict is seen as benefiting the second service of the FSB and the presidential administration, allowing the [[current_political_climate_and_leadership_in_russia | current government]] to watch the opposition "drown each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. The losers are the opposition itself and Russian society, which views the infighting with cynicism, wondering how the opposition is any better than the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

## Social Impact of Putin's Rule

A grim "apotheosis of [[putins_leadership_and_political_influence | Putin's economic and social policy]]" is highlighted by British publication *The Spectator*, citing official Russian statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. The expected life expectancy for Russian men decreased by almost 5 years between 2019 and 2021, falling to 64.2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>. This means that, on average, Russian men do not even live to the new retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

This situation is described as the "great dream of Russian economic and social cannibals" coming true: "Live humbly like cattle, die quickly, does not receive a pension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. The speaker promises that a new government, upon coming to power, will make reducing the retirement age and compensating those who did not receive pensions one of its very first decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

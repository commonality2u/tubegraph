The concept of a strategic trap describes a perilous situation in which a party finds itself in a conflict. This term, applicable in military art, business, and other fields where strategy is employed, is characterized by two main features: a fundamental inability to achieve military-political goals by military means, and a continued increase of efforts despite this inability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. The goals may appear obviously unattainable quite early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Examples of Strategic Traps

History provides several examples of superpowers, and modern Russia, falling into strategic traps:
*   The United States in Vietnam (1965-1973) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   The United States in Afghanistan (2001-2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   The Soviet Union in Afghanistan (1979-1989) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   Modern Russia in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

These traps have historically been long-lasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. All mentioned situations ended with withdrawal and political defeat, which was not necessarily military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. For instance, after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Soviet-backed leadership held out for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. In these decades, the United States and the Soviet Union wasted colossal resources to no avail, eventually making belated political decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

## [[factors_leading_to_strategic_traps | Reasons for Falling into Strategic Traps]]

Countries (or even corporations) fall into strategic traps due to several [[factors_leading_to_strategic_traps | reasons]]:
*   **Overestimation of Own Power**: The side initiating the conflict overestimates its own economic and military strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   **Underestimation of Enemy Strength**: The strength of the enemy is underestimated, including not only military power but also the ability of civilians to act as a permanent reservoir of resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.
*   **Misunderstanding of Theater of Operations**: The party holding the initiative fails to understand the significance of the specifics of the theater of military operations, such as the jungle in Vietnam or mountainous terrain in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
*   **Error in Assessing Strategic Context**: Underestimation or error in assessing the strategic context, which historically includes the confrontation between superpowers providing assistance to opposing sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. For example:
    *   The Soviet Union and China aided North Vietnam against the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>.
    *   The West aided Afghanistan against the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.
    *   The West is now aiding Ukraine against [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_strategic_traps | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. The West acts as a supplier of equipment, intelligence, and technologies, with Western PMCs actively involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

## [[factors_leading_to_strategic_traps | Reasons for Persisting in Strategic Traps]]

Countries often persist in these situations despite predictions of danger and the necessity of ending the conflict quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. Three main explanations are offered:
1.  **Arrogance of Power**: The hope that the difference in economic and military potential will eventually favor the side with greater potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. This arrogance has been characteristic of the US (Vietnam, Afghanistan) and the Soviet Union (Afghanistan), and now applies to the [[kremlins_strategic_challenges_and_alliances | Russian Federation]] in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.
2.  **Cognitive Delusion**: This is characteristic of military-political leadership, where they constantly increase stakes, much like a casino player, refusing to fix losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. Examples include US Defense Secretary McNamara proposing more military presence in Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>, and the Soviet Union's behavior in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_strategic_traps | Russia's]] energy war against Ukraine is seen as a desire to recoup and raise stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. This phenomenon is common in business where investments are increased in mediocre, losing projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.
3.  **Distorting Properties of Religion/Ideology**: While less typical for the US or Soviet Union (though ideology played a role), this is seen in conflicts like the Iran-Iraq War, driven by a fervent ideology, leading to immense losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.

## Capacity to Persist in Traps

Only countries possessing colossal economic and military potential, like past superpowers (US, Soviet Union) or those with passionate ideologies (Iran), can persist in such delusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. Economically developed countries of a smaller caliber are quickly forced to abandon conflicts and seek reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

Democratic systems generally have an advantage because criticism and competition force leaders to react faster to resource depletion, fearing election losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. This leads to a pattern where regional conflicts usually last 3-4 to 16-18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. In contrast, authoritarian leaders persist because losing or exiting on terms they deem dishonorable is fraught with the loss of political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>.

There is no conspiracy theory behind strategic traps; political and military leaderships willingly enter these situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. However, once deeply stuck and unwilling to withdraw, opponents begin a war of attrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>. This provides a "wonderful opportunity" for opponents to deliver a decisive blow and discourage future use of military force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>. In the case of [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_strategic_traps | Russia]] and Ukraine, this opportunity was provided personally by Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.

## Cognitive Fallacy: The Third Person Effect

When the Americans were preparing to invade Afghanistan, Russian experts (having Soviet experience) unanimously advised against it, predicting a bad outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>. However, a cognitive fallacy known as the "third person effect" was at play: "It was *you* who lost; *we* Americans will win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>. This fallacy is not unique to the US; it explains why people continue to gamble despite statistics, or enter financial pyramids, hoping to be among the lucky few <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>.

## The Current Situation: [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_strategic_traps | Russia]] in Ukraine

Unlike the Soviet Union, [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_strategic_traps | Russia]] is not a superpower in terms of economic and military potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. [[role_of_military_and_economic_power_in_conflicts | Russia's]] GDP share in the world is 1.7%, compared to 23% for the United States and 17% for the European Union, plus Japan and South Korea, demonstrating a colossal incomparability of economic and military potentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>.

Given this, victory for [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_strategic_traps | Russia]] is not possible; the focus should be on the conditions of an honorable withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>. The Russian government missed an "ideal chance" for withdrawal in March of the previous year, when Ukrainian leadership was ready for concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>. Now, neither the Ukrainian leadership nor society will make concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>.

The situation for [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_strategic_traps | Russia]] and its leadership will worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:00">[18:36:00]</a>. To achieve an "honorable exit" that could be presented as a victory, Putin is ready to do "anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>. He has two main resources: [[potential_use_of_nuclear_weapons | nuclear tactical weapons]] and manpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>. Given the shortage of modern weapons, he believes that [[potential_future_mobilization_and_military_strategies | Russia's human potential significantly exceeds Ukraine's]], and he is ready to sacrifice his own people to preserve his power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. Losses of up to half a million people are considered acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>.

The goals of the "special operation" are no longer outside [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_strategic_traps | Russia]], but inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:00">[20:44:00]</a>. The main goal for Putin is to preserve his own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>. However, this strategy is paradoxical, as every day he weakens his own power, and those around him and in society understand they are stuck in a trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>.

As Miyamoto Musashi, the author of *The Book of Five Rings*, observed, "immature strategy [is] the reason for sadness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>. This phrase accurately describes what has happened to [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_strategic_traps | Russia]], the Kremlin, and Putin personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:01:00">[22:01:00]</a>.

This situation increases the [[risks_of_escalation_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction | risks of escalation]], as the leadership may resort to extreme measures to maintain power, even if it entails significant losses for the populace. The broader geopolitical influences suggest that the West will continue to aid Ukraine, viewing it as an opportunity to weaken [[role_of_military_and_economic_power_in_conflicts | Russia's military power]] for the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>.

Despite the current difficulties, the new year may present a chance for a decisive influence on destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>.

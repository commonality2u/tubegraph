From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, in its fifth episode of "Answers to Hot Questions," addressed the overwhelming majority of inquiries concerning the second stage of [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This discussion follows a previous warning that the second stage could commence after the New Year holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Reliability of Information

Solovyov asserts the information's reliability by drawing parallels to his past predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>:
*   He spoke of the inevitability of an armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine a couple of months before February 24, 2022, even naming the date with week accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   Starting in spring, he knew a decision to [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilize]] had been made, predicting it would occur in the fall, though he did not know it would be termed "partial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. He also stated it would be a "belated decision" as there wouldn't be enough time to equip and prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   Similarly, from spring, he affirmed a fundamental decision was made to introduce martial law in the Russian Federation, which was introduced a month after the partial [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] on October 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

Given this track record, Solovyov emphasizes the "high, high probability" of a second stage of [[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization | mobilization]], though he clarifies that nothing is truly inevitable except death and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Purpose of Disseminating Information

Solovyov explains that sharing this information broadly serves two main purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>:
1.  **Influencing Decision-Making:** The wider the information spreads, the greater the chance the "Supreme Authority" will hesitate before making the decision or implement it with less severity and on a smaller scale than conceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
2.  **Preparation:** Informing people allows them to prepare. "Whoever is forewarned is forearmed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Societal Reaction and Social Maturity

Solovyov noted that some viewers reacted to his previous information as a "nightmare" that caused sleeplessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. He characterizes such a response, particularly from an audience predominantly over 35 with life experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, as "infantile" behaviorâ€”shielding oneself from unpleasant truths and acting like teenagers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. He stresses the importance of social maturity, which involves looking at events sensibly and impartially, accepting the truth no matter how unpleasant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

He argues that the attitude towards [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] is a "general national test" of intelligence, the ability to understand cause-and-effect relationships, and the "will to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. He criticizes those who, upon receiving a summons, passively ask "what should we do?" as exhibiting a "weakened survival instinct" and a "lack of will to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

He distinguishes between those who believe the homeland is truly threatened and feel a duty to fight on foreign land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, and those who seek to improve their personal situation or pay off debts through military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. He warns the latter not to complain about losses, as history shows the state will not provide meaningful compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Technical Aspects of the Next Mobilization

Solovyov addresses the surprise regarding the potential figure of two million mobilized individuals, explaining that Ukraine has already mobilized a million, and Russia's traditional strategy is to "throw bodies" at the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. This large number is needed to win time and ensure the professional army can rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

The two million figure includes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>:
*   **300,000 women:** Primarily doctors, medical personnel, drivers of large transport, signalmen, and cooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   **Engineering and Technical Personnel:** Those attracted to engineering and technical work will not necessarily take up arms but will be placed on the front line under shelling to create fortification strips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. They will be paid a couple of thousand rubles a day, and the time will be counted as double work experience, which Solovyov sees as a "test of intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

Regarding equipment, Solovyov states that individuals will likely be responsible for providing their own bulletproof vests and clothing, as was seen in the first stage. This will force families into debt to increase their loved ones' chances of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Uniforms are expected from Iran, and machine guns from North Korea, in addition to Russian warehouses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

### Methods of Mobilization

The authorities will learn from past mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>:
*   They will no longer solely rely on distributing summonses to apartments, as people are now taught not to open doors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
*   Summonses will be issued at workplaces, facilitated by the lifting of legal restrictions once martial law applies to most or all of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   Databases, including the pension fund, state services, and traffic police, have been integrated to collect information on places of work and identify those subject to [[resumption_of_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.
*   Face recognition systems will also be used to identify potential draftees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.
*   Employers were obliged to submit information about military-liable employees by November 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

These measures indicate a much harsher approach than the previous [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

## Advice and Preparation

Solovyov offers strategic advice:
*   **Use your intelligence and will to live:** Make decisions and implement them with all your might to fight for your single life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   **Do not rely on compensation:** He stresses that those who participate should not hope for compensation or support for their families, as it will not be provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.
*   **Have cash:** Given the potential for the Russian banking and financial system to collapse, it is advisable to have a supply of cash, as currency will remain valuable while other forms of money may not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. He anticipates no shortage of food or vodka, but a shortage of what is considered "money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

Solovyov reiterates the importance of sharing this information, as the more people know and see, the better prepared they can be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. He concludes by stating that while the situation is difficult, he has few doubts that [[resumption_of_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] will begin, but expresses hope for eventual victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

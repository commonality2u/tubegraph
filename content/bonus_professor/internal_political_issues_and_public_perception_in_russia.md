The [[political_situation_in_Russia | political situation in Russia]], particularly the [[the_internal_political_and_social_atmosphere_in_russia | internal political and social atmosphere]], is experiencing significant challenges, marked by public skepticism, concerns about leadership, and tightening internal repressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. These issues are exacerbated by the ongoing military operations and their perceived lack of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

## Cancellations and Security Concerns

In early May 2023, traditional celebrations for May 1st and May 9th were impacted by security concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
Mass outdoor events related to May 1st and May 9th were cancelled in front-line regions bordering Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Any events that are held will be virtually online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Parades, including the air portion of the May 9th parade, have been cancelled even in the deep rear, such as Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Red Square was closed for quarantine in preparation for the parade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

These cancellations are attributed to perceived "successes" in military operations and increased fears of Ukrainian drone attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Ukrainian drones are now capable of reaching Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>, leading to elements of a "siege or semi-siege state" in the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. Residents of Moscow have noted an increased presence of Russian Guard patrols in public places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

## [[russian_political_situation_and_governance_issues | Challenges to Russian Leadership]]

The key problem for Russia is identified not on the fronts, but within the Kremlin, specifically with President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

### [[public_perception_and_potential_triggers_for_sociopolitical_change_in_russia | Public Perception]] of President Putin

The [[public_opinion_and_political_shifts_in_russia | Russian public]] no longer perceives the president as a source of their well-being; instead, he is seen as a "key problem," a "key threat," and a "toxic asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

### Presidential Doubles and Public Awareness

There is significant tension within the establishment regarding the president's health, which is reportedly "extremely bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. Last week, the president did not appear at public events; a double was seen instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. The opening of the Turkish nuclear power plant was reportedly attended by a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. It is not guaranteed that the actual Russian President will be at the May 9th parade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

Discussions about the president's doubles are intensifying both outside and inside Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. Dmitry Peskov, the president's press secretary, was forced to indirectly react to these claims, stating the president has "wonderful health" and is "hyperactive," working without bunkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. However, the upper echelons of the Russian elite reportedly avoid participating in events where a double is present unless absolutely necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

The idea of presidential doubles has become a "media reality" and a "reality of [[public_opinion_and_political_shifts_in_russia | public opinion]]" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>. This concept, known as the Thomas theorem (if people perceive situations as real, they are real in their consequences), is expected to affect people's behavior in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

### Establishment's Worsening Attitude

Evidence suggests a worsening attitude towards the president within the establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>. A leaked conversation between billionaire Roman Trotsenko and businessman Nikolai Matushevsky revealed "vivid characteristics" of the current and future situation, reflecting critical views of the president, his entourage, and the government's policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.

Internationally, the president is in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. South Africa reportedly asked Vladimir Putin not to attend a conference in August, suggesting he participate via video link instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. As a result, the president has reportedly decided against any international trips, possibly with the exception of Minsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>. A conversation between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky further highlighted Russia's deteriorating international standing, with China reportedly agreeing not to supply weapons to the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>.

## Military Personnel Shortages

The Russian military faces "gloomy expectations" regarding a potential Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. They acknowledge a significant "shortage of personnel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. An ongoing advertising campaign to recruit contract soldiers aims to gather 400,000 to 500,000 people, but its success is questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. If this recruitment effort fails, "mobilization" will be discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. Summonses are already being delivered in St. Petersburg, not only to conscripts but also to other individuals, threatening restrictive measures if they fail to appear at military registration offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

The Wagner PMC leader, Yevgeny Prigozhin, has publicly stated the severe shortage of ammunition and personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. Both Wagner PMC and the Ministry of Defense, along with private military companies like Redut, are now intensively recruiting prisoners to compensate for personnel shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Prigozhin's frank statements, including an interview with Z correspondent Pegov, suggest deep fears of a successful Ukrainian offensive and a desire to deflect blame in case of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. He behaves "brazenly" because he perceives that "the situation has gone to hell," and it could worsen significantly with a Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>.

## Government Response: Repression

In response to these challenges, the authorities are tightening internal repressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:57:00">[18:57:00]</a>. This includes targeting those they consider the "fifth column," "traitors of the Motherland," and "dangerous subjects," regardless of actual wrongdoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>. This policy is described as "very painful" for those who maintain a civil temperament and dare to express their opinions in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>.

Despite these descriptions of a worsening [[the_political_climate_in_russia_and_government_policies | political climate]] and [[public_discontent_and_political_dynamics_in_russia | public discontent]], there is a belief that the situation is "developing in the right direction" and that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>.

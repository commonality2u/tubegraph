The 125th issue of the program "What is Happening," broadcast on Monday, May 27, at 1 PM Moscow time, focused on several key topics: the "defeat of the tracks of the military underground," the idiom "those living in a glass house throw stones," and the idea that [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | NATO]] is preparing for a hybrid war with the [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Arrests of Military Personnel

The phrase "hugging the factory of the military underground" is a parody of 1930s Soviet Union vocabulary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It refers to the arrests of generals and other military personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Over the past month, five high-ranking military personnel, including four generals, have been arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Initially, arrests such as those of Timur Ivanov and Kuznetsov were attributed to economic crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. However, the subsequent arrests of Army Commander Popov and Vadim Shamarin, Deputy Gerasimov, are considered to have a different, more political background, even though they were formally accused of economic crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. For instance, Ivan Popov was accused of stealing 12 tons of metal products, which is considered an unlikely scenario given his position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The arrest of a colonel or lieutenant colonel involved in purchasing military products also falls into this pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Talk of a "Military Mutiny"

The arrests of two generals are openly discussed as having a political background, even in Moscow drawing rooms and expert circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. It's suggested that military counterintelligence "exposed the military mutiny" and seized a "hydra" connected with Khodorkovsky, leading to the term "defeat of the Trotskyist military conspiracy tracks of the military mutiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Despite the sarcastic tone of the speaker, military rebellion in [[russian_domestic_political_situation | Russia]] is certainly possible, as demonstrated by Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin on June 24 last year, when his rebellion almost reached the [[russian_domestic_political_situation | Russian capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. It is confirmed that Prigozhin was not in Chad during this time, and photos/videos circulating were either of another person or taken earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. He was also not in Latin America, but rather in "tempting proximity to Russian borders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

A past attempt at military rebellion occurred in 1998, organized by General Lev Rokhlin, which had "good chances for the implementation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that whether a rebellion was genuinely being prepared is less important than the fact that it has become "part of the political reality in [[russian_domestic_political_situation | Russia]]" and is being discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Discussions about a military mutiny are considered an "ominous sign of the weakness of the political system and the weakness of the regime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The regime, while still referred to as the VM Putin regime, is seen as "beginning to disintegrate" and weaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Putin's Double and Regime Weakness

The visit of the "so-called Putin," identified as Yevgeny Vasilyevich, a double of the original Putin, to Belarus and his meeting with Alexander Grigorievich Lukashenko, highlights the regime's weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Lukashenko's greeting, "I am glad to welcome you to your native Belarusian land," is interpreted as a "fat troll" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> because the double is supposedly from Mogilev, making the land truly native to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This also points to Lukashenko's clear domination and mockery of the double during the meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Another physical characteristic noted is that the double is taller than the original Putin by 5-7 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

During this meeting, the "illegitimate Zelensky" was discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The speaker points out the irony of Lukashenko, who lost elections, and the "Putin double," who is part of an "exceptional profanation" of elections, commenting on Zelensky's legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Zelensky is seen as legitimate because Ukraine is fighting for survival and does not need to hold elections during wartime, a situation confirmed by numerous historical experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. This move is viewed as an attempt by the [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | Russian side]] to compromise Zelensky and disavow the idea of the Switzerland peace conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

Former Ukrainian president Yanukovych was reportedly forced to fly to Minsk to "give additional strength to the allegations about the illegitimate Sky Knut," suggesting he is a "legitimate candidate" ready to lead "liberated lands of Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This argument is dismissed as "absolute fiction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## NATO and Hybrid Warfare

A third key topic is the idea that [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | NATO]] is preparing for a hybrid war with [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Part of the [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | Russian military-political leadership]] cherishes the idea of changing the strategic context of the conflict with Ukraine by distracting the West and [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | NATO]] to another theater of military operations, similar to what happened with the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. They believe a new field of tension can be created in Europe, primarily in the Baltic countries like Latvia and Estonia, due to their large proportion of Russian-speaking populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

This hybrid operation is conceived to involve military elements only at the final stage, with initial stages focused on creating chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. One of the most effective tools for this is cyber attacks on banking institutions, state, and municipal institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | Russian Federation]] has been testing its ability to bring down such sites and damage navigation systems in the Baltic Sea area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. The hybrid operation is staged to deepen chaos, and if [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | NATO]] does not resist, it will escalate to the inclusion of a military component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

[[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | NATO]] Secretary General Stoltenberg stated that [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | NATO]] could apply Article 5 on collective defense in the event of a serious cyber attack on one of its member countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. He added that [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | NATO]] would warn Moscow and could respond "not only in cyberspace but also in other areas to protect [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | NATO]] allies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Article 5 states that an armed attack on one [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | NATO]] member will be considered an attack on the alliance as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. This response specifically applies to a hybrid operation, even at its initial stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

However, there is skepticism that [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | NATO]] would give a tough response, as it has been afraid to do so in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | Russia]] might declare that [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | NATO]]'s response to cyber attacks could threaten the [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | Russian Federation]], potentially justifying the use of nuclear weapons, at least tactical ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. While the current [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | Russian leadership]] is not seen as a supporter of using nuclear weapons, they do engage in "nuclear vocabulary, nuclear rhetoric and nuclear blackmail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

The speaker's warnings about the seriousness of a hybrid operation are confirmed by [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | NATO]]'s current attitude toward this prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

Political commentator Valery Solovey presents his insights into the future of Russia, focusing on anticipated political transformations, the potential for greater freedom, and the path towards a more democratic society. His analysis draws from questions posed by his audience, offering a unique perspective on the nation's trajectory.

## The Imminence of Political Change

Solovey expresses strong conviction that significant political changes are on the horizon for Russia. He anticipates a period where "real criminals" will be brought to trial, a development he believes will occur sooner than many expect, possibly "already next year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. His team is dedicated to bringing about the "beginning of the trials of those people who committed crimes against humanity, against society, against their people and against their country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

### Anticipated Presidential Transition

A central theme of Solovey's predictions is the imminent [[political_transition_in_russia | physical death of Vladimir Putin]], which he states will happen "absolutely definitely before the end of autumn and rather even earlier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. While authorities may attempt to conceal this event, it will "not be possible to hide it for long" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Once this information becomes public, it will trigger shifts within the elite, including regional figures, and initiate a broader "movement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

This period is expected to be marked by initial chaos, but Solovey and his team are striving to ensure it is "short-term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. He predicts "great events" will begin "very soon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

### Role of Doubles and Elite Conflicts

Solovey discusses the use of a double for the Russian president, confirming that the West and China are aware of this and are prepared to engage with the double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. He notes a "conflict between about how to carry out Ponce's rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>, implying internal disagreements within the ruling circles. This conflict is so severe that these groups "will inevitably clash in a fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>, leading to the public disclosure of information about Putin's death and the doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.

Yevgeny Prigozhin is also expected to re-emerge as a political force after Putin's death, intending to "tell a lot of interesting things in particular about the double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

### Economic and Social Repercussions

The [[prospects_of_political_crisis_and_potential_changes_in_russian_governance | political crisis]] is expected to be synchronous with a "large-scale economic crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>, with signs already visible in ruble devaluation, inflation, and a sense of economic instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.

Upon Putin's death, public reaction is anticipated to be mixed, with many expressing regret and fearing instability, rather than universal joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:47:00">[24:47:00]</a>.

## Path Towards Freedom and Democracy

Solovey outlines his vision for a future Russia, emphasizing fundamental changes to its governance and societal norms.

### Constitutional and Administrative Reforms

He advocates for the transformation of Russia from a "nominal Federation into an actual one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:18:00">[30:18:00]</a>. The immediate necessary step is granting "budgetary independence" and increasing it for the regions of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:24:00">[30:24:00]</a>. A new Constitution, prepared by a constitutional conference, should be adopted by referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:58:00">[26:58:00]</a>.

### Freedom of Speech and Societal Values

Regarding [[human_rights_and_freedom_of_speech_in_russia | freedom of speech]], Solovey personally supports the American model, which has "very little" restrictions compared to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:43:00">[26:43:00]</a>.

He identifies as a "liberal conservative or conservative liberal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>, supporting:
*   Traditional family and human relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>
*   Decency and honesty as paramount qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>
*   The importance of competition for societal benefit, contrasting it with over 70 years of Soviet power and the last 20 years without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>
*   Being a "populist" as a part of his people, remaining in Russia with them "in sorrow and in happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>

### Opportunities for Change

Solovey believes that following Putin's departure and the ensuing crisis, Russia will have "a chance to get on the rails of the correct free competitive and competitive development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:00]</a>. He anticipates "grandiose events" in the coming months, possibly "a year and a half," which will "far exceed the 1990s in the nineties" in terms of scale and consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>.

## Optimism and Warnings

Solovey maintains an optimistic outlook, stating he is "well informed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>, which fuels his confidence. He acknowledges the "news is alarming but encouraging" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:49:00">[30:49:00]</a>.

However, he issues warnings:
*   The risk of mobilization has weakened but "has not disappeared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:21:00">[28:21:00]</a>, potentially used as a "disciplinary measure to keep the people in check" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:18:00">[28:18:00]</a>.
*   [[social_unrest_and_potential_for_protest_in_russia | Safety in Russia]] is "relative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:21:00">[32:21:00]</a>, and no one can count on absolute safety.

He encourages his audience to "take care of yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:15:00">[35:15:00]</a> and to remain "alive and healthy and in a normal mental state" for the "decisive events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:20:00">[35:20:00]</a>.

"Victory will be ours it will certainly be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:20:00">[36:20:00]</a>.
</div>

Solovey asks for support—moral, informational, and financial—to bring about "our common victory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38:00">[35:38:00]</a>.

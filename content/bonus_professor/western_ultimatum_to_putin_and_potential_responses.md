Valery Solovey, in the 51st issue of his program "Moscow is with You," recorded on February 19th and aired on February 20th, discussed a perceived "crusade against [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Putin]]" and its potential ramifications for Russia's future, as well as the Russian offensive and revelations by Seymour Hersh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The program also touches on the current state of Russia's military and the evolving geopolitical landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## The Western Ultimatum

The recent Munich conference is described as having declared a "crusade against Mr. [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] personally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This campaign is underpinned by two primary theses:
*   The West aims to inflict military defeat on Russia and strip it of all territorial gains in Ukraine, including Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   [[president_putins_actions_and_intentsions | Putin]]'s threats, including the use of nuclear weapons, will not deter the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

It is suggested that the West is intentionally provoking [[security_and_risk_concerns_for_putin | Putin]] to react harshly, possibly to incite his inner circle to take decisive action against potentially "inadequate actions by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## China's Ambiguous Position

China's stance, articulated at the Munich conference, is noted as "very interesting and ambiguous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. While China is "reluctantly and slowly, drifting towards the position of the Western coalition," it also declares categorical opposition to unilateral sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Crucially, the Chinese representative stated that China insists on peace and is prepared to present its own "Peace Plan," based on "respect for the sovereignty of both parties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This formulation is interpreted to mean actual recognition that Russia "must renounce its territorial claims from Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The very existence of this plan implies that China "does not believe in the possibility of Victory of the Russian Federation" or in the "strategic genius of [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | President Putin]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. A potential meeting between Xi Jinping and [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Putin]] was conditional on Russia achieving a decisive victory or going for peace, with the former option now considered "crossed out" by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Potential Responses from President Putin

[[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | President Putin]] is expected to deliver both verbal and practical (military) responses to the Western "ultimatum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

### Verbal Response: Federal Assembly Message

A verbal response is anticipated in [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Putin]]'s message to the Federal Assembly on February 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. While the Kremlin traditionally inflates expectations for such addresses, they often result in "information bubbles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The only past instance where a serious decision was announced was in January 2020, regarding constitutional reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

Three potential options for [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]]'s message are outlined, varying in their degree of radicalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>:

*   **"Horror, Horror"**: This most radical option would involve [[president_putins_actions_and_intentsions | Putin]] declaring a "people's war on NATO to the last Russian," accompanied by general mobilization and martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. While no signs yet point to this, such versions of the message are prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. It is suggested that [[security_and_risk_concerns_for_putin | Putin]] himself might fear such a radical path, given his past experience with the decision on February 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

*   **"Just Horror"**: Acknowledging a lack of "fateful successes" in Ukraine, this option would involve [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] announcing new "victories" to compensate for failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Discussions include the potential inclusion of South Ossetia and Abkhazia into Russia, and the declaration of Transnistria's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This is seen as a purely propaganda message that even "deceived Russians" would treat with irony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

*   **"Usual Nonsense"**: This option, predicted by the speaker, entails [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] issuing "many threats, many hints" without announcing any concrete decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Putin]] is characterized as someone who prefers to "throw a pebble into a pond and looks at the circles" to observe public reaction before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The ultimate choice among these options will be made just hours before the address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

### Practical Response: New Offensive

The practical response involves a new Russian offensive, which must be executed quickly and succeed before Ukraine receives advanced Western weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. The advanced Western weapons are capable of significantly increasing Russian losses and are considered key to Ukraine's counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

However, Russian military personnel are reportedly reluctant to go on the offensive, viewing it as a "big mistake," which reflects a poor moral and psychological state within the armed forces and command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. There is also an "acute shortage of weapons in the Russian armed forces," forcing Russia to rely on remnants of Soviet equipment, while Ukraine is receiving advanced Western weaponry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

[[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] desires a new mobilization, with organizational and technical preparations underway, and a "sluggish" mobilization already in progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. The lack of an "open, acute and massive form of mobilization" is attributed to two factors: an apparent inability to secure enough uniforms/equipment, and [[security_and_risk_concerns_for_putin | Putin]]'s fear of the consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

### Lukashenko's Disbelief and Potential Escalation

[[president_putins_actions_and_intentsions | Putin]]'s closest ally, Alexander Lukashenko, demonstrates "completely obvious disbelief" in [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]]'s strategic talents, even openly "trolling" the Russian president during their meeting on February 17th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. This suggests [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] lacks confidence, which Lukashenko senses and exploits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

If the Russian armed forces' offensive fails, or if the command staff's reluctance turns into sabotage, [[security_and_risk_concerns_for_putin | Putin]] might be compelled to "reach out for that very nuclear baton" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Despite warnings from China and the West's stated lack of fear, the risk of nuclear weapon use is described as "colossal," with [[security_and_risk_concerns_for_putin | Putin]] reportedly being "psychologically morally ready for this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. The world is considered closer to the possibility of nuclear weapon use now than perhaps ever before, including during the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.

## Seymour Hersh's Revelations

The program briefly discusses the revelations by Pulitzer Prize winner Seymour Hersh regarding the explosion of the Nord Stream pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. The information provided by Hersh is deemed to have "absolutely no relation" to reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. It is suggested that Hersh was "played blind" by a "non-Russian" source, possibly due to his "dementia state and the tendency to conspiracy theories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. Russian propaganda was reportedly "bewildered" by the revelations, indicating it was not a Russian-orchestrated leak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

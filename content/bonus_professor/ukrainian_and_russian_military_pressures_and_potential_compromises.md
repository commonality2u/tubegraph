Valery Solovey's program, "What is Happening," discussed the [[militarypolitical_situation_in_ukraine_and_russia | military-political situation in Russia and Ukraine]], including attempts at persuasion and strategic positioning. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>

## Attempts to Persuade Kazakhstan

A trip by "so-called President" Vladimir Putin (identified as Putin's double, Yevgeny Vasilyevich) to Kazakhstan was an "unsuitable attempt" to increase import volumes through Kazakhstan and encourage its participation as an intermediary for supplying dual-use products to the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. However, Kazakhstan's President Tokayev "politely but adamantly" refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Tokayev made it clear that Kazakhstan had exhausted its transit aid resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Strengthening aid and increasing import volumes to Russia through Kazakhstan would lead to "serious problems" for the Kazakh economy and financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Tokayev's behavior reportedly showed "clear mockery" and a "dismissive attitude" toward the Russian representative, with Tokayev "clearly dominated" the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Russia's "Miracle Weapon" Boasting

In response to Kazakhstan's refusal, the individual identified as Yevgeny Vasilyevich (currently listed as Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin) "boasted and drawn out" about a "miracle weapon" capable of changing the strategic situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This weapon, referred to as "Sel" (or "hazelnuts"), was presented as a threat to Europe, including London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The speaker likened this boasting to an "impotent" person "boast[ing] of his former sexual exploits and his mythical sexual power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, calling the rocket a "fliski symbol of Dada" [00:03:54].

Regarding the weapon's capabilities:
*   With the exception of one specimen used, only "two or three" of these "so-called hazelnuts" exist in the arsenal of the Russian Armed Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   The product is described as not very original or new, but rather a "recombination and modernization of the missile weapons already in existence since Soviet times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   Establishing "serial production" of this weapon is a "long and long, not fast" process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The West is aware of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Syria's Situation and Diversion of Resources

The fall of Aleppo, the largest city in Syria, to armed forces occurred "instantly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Russian specialists in Syria reportedly "evaporated into captivity or simply disappeared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. When Syrian President Assad flew to Moscow to request [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | military assistance]], Russia refused "politely but adamantly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The reason given was that "all the weapons were thrown to the [[russianukrainian_relations_and_the_prospect_of_war | Ukrainian front]]," and there was no equipment, planes, or sufficient [[challenges_faced_by_russian_and_ukrainian_military_forces | military personnel]] available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The speaker notes that PMC Wagner no longer exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The situation in Syria is part of a game involving Turkey, Iran, and Russia, where the Russian side "looks, frankly speaking, not very convincing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Russia's Search for Military Aid

Russian Defense Minister Belousov traveled to Pyongyang to meet with North Korean officials, who are described as "big North Korean friends" of the Russian Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The visit's "hidden background" is that the new American administration has begun consultations with China and North Korea, proposing to reduce the volume of [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | military aid]] to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This is seen by the US as a way to force Russia to the negotiation table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Belousov's goal was to ensure the continued supply of critically necessary ammunition, shells, and missiles from North Korea to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Depletion of Military Resources and Readiness for Negotiations

Both Russia and Ukraine are experiencing a "progressive inability of the parties to conduct intensive military action" due to depleted resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This situation is "noticeable on both sides" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Ukraine's Shift Towards Compromise
Ukrainian President Zelensky made an "unprecedented statement" in an interview with Sky, indicating that Ukraine is ready to abandon a [[impact_and_consequences_of_potential_ukrainian_counteroffensive | military return]] of lost territories in exchange for NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Previously, Ukraine publicly sought the return of all lost territories to the borders of January 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Zelensky is preparing the Ukrainian audience for a compromise with the Russian Federation, suggesting that territories could be returned "diplomatically by peaceful means" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. However, Zelensky understands that NATO membership for Ukraine is not immediately forthcoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. The speaker questions how the Ukrainian audience, particularly the "irreconcilable part" within the armed forces, will perceive such statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

### Russia's Continued Pressure
On the other hand, Russia continues to try to increase pressure and take "as much territory under control as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. While this is "not very successfully," some progress is still being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Ukraine is "retreating in an organized manner and inflicting serious losses on the Russian side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, while simultaneously expressing readiness for compromise through its leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

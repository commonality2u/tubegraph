The presidential elections in the United States are considered the most important in the world, with significant implications for global peace and [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_stances_of_kremlin | international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. While the United States no longer holds the unquestioning leadership role it did in previous decades, its leading position remains, influencing many countries, including the [[Kremlins foreign policy and decisionmaking | Russian leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The results of these elections are pivotal for both Russian domestic and international policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Initial Reactions and Communications

Following the US presidential elections, on November 6, two Russian elite coalitions, one led by Chemezov and the other by Patrushev, sent "enthusiastic congratulations" to Donald Trump through informal channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This information was reported by the SVR general Telegram channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Trump responded to these messages, referring to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as an "incident" that it is time to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This definition reflects a significant aspect of Trump's foreign policy views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

One of the messages conveyed to Trump suggested not peace, but a "truce" as a necessary preliminary stage for peace negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Trump's Conversation with Russia

On November 7, a conversation reportedly took place between Donald Trump and the "so-called president of Russia" (identified as a double of Yevgeny Vasilyevich) at the Valdai Forum, as reported by The Washington Post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Trump inquired about who holds decision-making authority, and was advised to speak with the individual calling himself [[President Putins actions and intentions | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The conversation was noted to have a delay due to technical issues and the involvement of translators and curators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

During this call, the Kremlin presented its proposed contours for peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>:
*   Crimea remains on the Russian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   Donetsk and Luhansk regions (within administrative borders) remain on the Russian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   Ukraine would exchange the Kursk region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   Russia would give up controlled fragments of territories in the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   The Kremlin proposed abandoning the idea of maintaining a land corridor to Crimea, provided Ukraine guarantees unimpeded transit of goods and people from mainland Russia to the Crimean peninsula through Ukrainian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This marks a step back from previous consultations, which had insisted on retaining the land corridor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

Trump's response was a pause, stating he could not comment immediately and would consider the proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The leak of this conversation suggests that some in Trump's circle are unhappy with or view these proposals as unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Trump's worldview, influenced by commercial logic, tends to see Ukraine in a subordinate position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Challenges to Trump's Foreign Policy

Despite the significant powers of the American president, they are not absolute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Even with his party (Republican) controlling Congress and the Supreme Court, the president is not a dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Trump will need to contend with officials within his own party who may have different views on the [[geopolitical_implications | international situation]], particularly the Russia-Ukraine confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Key positions influencing foreign policy include the Secretary of State, the Assistant to the President for National Security, and the Secretary of Defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

Furthermore, the "Deep State"—the Washington bureaucracy—which blocked many of Trump's initiatives during his first presidency (2016-2020) that it deemed detrimental to US interests or its role in the [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_stances_of_kremlin | international arena]], still exists and can influence decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

## Trump's Ambitions and Motivation

For his second and final term, Trump is expected to seek epochal achievements, both domestically (e.g., economic growth, migration restriction) and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. He has expressed a desire to be known as a "president of peace" rather than war, aiming to act as a peacemaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. He aspires to be a "winner" who brings peace and ends bloodshed, potentially even dreaming of a Nobel Peace Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

Trump's "economic-centric" foreign policy provides a strong incentive to establish peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. As president of the most powerful country, he has the potential to influence and even pressure both sides of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

Valery Solovyov's program, recorded on Sunday, June 19, focuses on two key issues: the [[consultations_and_proposals_for_resolving_the_ukraine_conflict | negotiations]] in Kyiv and changes in the political landscape in [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia]]. Solovyov states that the information presented includes new details, and in the second case, sensational revelations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

## The "Big Three" Visit to Kyiv

The visit of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, and Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi to Kyiv aimed to persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to engage in [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace talks]] with [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia]], potentially involving territorial compromises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. These expectations were generally justified, as behind the scenes, this was indeed the objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

According to Solovyov's sources, Draghi and Macron were the primary persuaders, allegedly influenced by "serious, reliable, and sensitive dirt" held by the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. Scholz reportedly acted as an "extra," nodding in agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

### Shift in Public Stance

Despite the initial intention, the public statement following the [[consultations_and_proposals_for_resolving_the_ukraine_conflict | negotiations]] was "directly opposite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Unconditional support for [[ukraine_and_western_countries_challenges_in_negotiating_peace_with_russia | Ukraine's position]], including its territorial integrity, was declared, and it was made clear that [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace negotiations]] would not occur without some success on [[ukraine_and_western_countries_challenges_in_negotiating_peace_with_russia | Ukraine's part]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

Reasons for this shift include:
*   President Zelensky's tough and unyielding stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   The firm position of the United States, Great Britain, and a significant portion of NATO countries, who favor either a "war to a victorious end" or establishing conditions for [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace negotiations]] on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   The psycho-emotional impact on the "troika" from visiting Irpin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

## Military Assistance and Battlefield Prospects

Following the "Big Three" visit, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a trip to Kyiv, confirming his "unconditional solidarity with [[ukraine_and_western_countries_challenges_in_negotiating_peace_with_russia | Ukraine]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. The crucial factor, according to Solovyov, is not mere declarations but "real military assistance, its size and quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

This assistance must enable [[ukraine_and_western_countries_challenges_in_negotiating_peace_with_russia | Ukraine]] to achieve at least equality with the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russian Federation]] and potentially a strategic turn on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Such aid can primarily be provided by the United States, which appears ready to do so, even risking an increase in conflict with [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

The appearance of this aid, including weapons and trained personnel (currently being trained in the US and NATO countries), is expected in July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. If this occurs, qualitative changes on the battlefield could be seen by the end of July or beginning of August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

David Arakhamia, head of [[ukraine_and_western_countries_challenges_in_negotiating_peace_with_russia | Ukraine's]] currently frozen [[consultations_and_proposals_for_resolving_the_ukraine_conflict | negotiating group]] with [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia]], recently stated that [[ukraine_and_western_countries_challenges_in_negotiating_peace_with_russia | Ukraine]] might resume [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | negotiations]] with [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia]] at the end of August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. This timing is linked to a calculated strengthening of Kyiv's [[discussion_on_russian__ukrainian_relations_and_conflict_resolution | negotiating position]] on the battlefield, potentially including the return of Kherson under Ukrainian control and a counteroffensive in Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

However, the resumption of [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace talks]] does not necessarily mean peace. Both Boris Johnson and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg are urging NATO countries to prepare for a "long campaign" and "long-term assistance to [[ukraine_and_western_countries_challenges_in_negotiating_peace_with_russia | Ukraine]], calculated for several years," encompassing military aid, state infrastructure maintenance, and restoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

## Kremlin's Perspective and Internal Dynamics

The [[kremlins_perception_of_peace_with_ukraine | Kremlin]], while preparing for a long "special military operation," would find it "very important to achieve some result already by the end of autumn, beginning of winter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. This is because, based on internal political dynamics and President Putin's health, a decision on the transfer of power or a gradual replacement of Putin with another person might begin in late autumn or early winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. In this scenario, the internal political agenda would take precedence for the Kremlin, and the military agenda would become "excessive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

### Elite Split in [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia]]

Solovyov claims that conversations about a split in the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russian]] elites, previously hypothetical, are now becoming a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. A "drain coalition" or "anti-Patrushev coalition" has begun to form. Key figures in this emerging coalition include:
*   Roman Abramovich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>
*   Anatoly Chubais <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>
*   Vladimir Potanin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>
*   Oleg Deripaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>

Solovyov highlights Deripaska's demonstrative refusal to applaud Putin at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum as an indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. This coalition also includes the "famous Yeltsin family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.

This "anti-Patrushev" alliance is opposing the influence of Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev, who is reportedly trying to position his son, Dmitry Patrushev (Minister of Agriculture), as Putin's successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. This succession plan is meeting "extreme resistance" not only from oligarchs and civilians but also from within the security groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. The struggle stems from a desire to prevent power from remaining in the hands of the security forces, especially with Nikolai Patrushev governing from behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.

The potential successors favored by this emerging coalition are Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov as president and Elvira Nabiullina, head of the Central Bank, as head of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>. This indicates a clear "confrontation between civilians and security forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>.

This struggle for "Putin's [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia]]" has recently intensified because the higher elite understands that Putin will soon have to leave his position or significantly weaken his presence in Russian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a>. While the current alliance is situational, it signifies the opening of a "hunting season" in [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russian]] politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. Solovyov notes the "strange death of oil workers in recent months" and the sudden death of Alexey Ogarov (former head of Uralvagonzavod), which some believe may not have been of natural causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.

Solovyov urges listeners to be "interested observers" and prepare for the possibility that the conflict within the elites will open opportunities for active citizens to influence [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia's]] historical trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>. He emphasizes that the process of significant change has begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:23:00">[18:23:00]</a>. While the coming months will be difficult and painful for [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia]], he concludes with a message of hope: "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>.

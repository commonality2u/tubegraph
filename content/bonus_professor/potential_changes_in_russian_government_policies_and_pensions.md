Valery Solovey, speaking from Moscow, provided insights into anticipated [[future_political_changes_in_russia | political changes in Russia]] and their potential impact on economic and social policies, including pensions. He emphasized that the year 2023 has a high chance of becoming a decisive year for Russia's future, offering an opportunity to influence the country's destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>.

## Economic Outlook Amidst Political Crisis

Solovey predicts that Russia faces a serious [[future_political_changes_and_developments_in_russia | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. During such a crisis, people typically shift to defensive assets like currency or gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. He anticipates currencies will appreciate, while real estate prices will decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. However, if the crisis is relatively short-lived, real estate could begin to rise in price again during the recovery phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. For those considering leaving Russia permanently, selling real estate now might be advisable due to declining demand, which could make future sales more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. Conversely, holding real estate for a longer term (a couple of years or more) might result in a favorable outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

## Pension System Reforms

The speaker states that a "new government" will need to address the pension system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. Key proposed reforms include:
*   **Canceling the increase in retirement age** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   **Providing compensation** for those who lost benefits due to the previous retirement age increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
*   **Increasing pensions** by reducing "non-productive expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

However, Solovey expresses doubt that pensions can be radically increased by two or three times in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. A fundamental reform of the pension system itself is necessary, as the previous "reform" was merely an increase in the retirement age without true structural changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. While pensions could become "more decent," a drastic increase requires deeper reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

## Broader Government and Societal Changes

Valery Solovey discusses several [[potential_government_reforms_and_policies_in_russia | potential government reforms and policies]] in [[potential_political_changes_in_russia_after_putin | post-Putin Russia]]:

### Human Rights and Legal Framework
*   **Cancellation of Human Rights-Violating Laws:** All laws and by-laws that violated fundamental human rights will be canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
*   **Punishment for Guilty Parties:** Those who developed, initiated, or inspired these laws will be punished according to the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
*   **Restoration of Constitutional Legality:** A new service, possibly within the Ministry of Internal Affairs or as a separate entity, will be created to protect and restore citizens' rights. This includes providing compensation to those whose rights were violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This will be a systematic, planned, and long-term effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

### Economic Transformation
*   **Financial System Revision:** There will be a need to revise banking, credit, financial, and monetary policies, including credit holidays and the state taking on some irrevocable debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>.
*   **Economic Growth:** Creating conditions for economic growth and prosperity is considered one of the best ways to help people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.
*   **Role for Russians Abroad:** When the [[change_in_the_political_landscape_in_russia | situation in Russia]] radically changes politically and economically, the knowledge, technologies (including management), experience, and money of Russians living abroad will be valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Russia is expected to become a country with a high margin, offering significant earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

### Social and Cultural Aspects
*   **Combating Informing:** As soon as the state ceases to encourage a climate of informing and administrative/police pressure on citizens, the need for denunciations will disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **Education Reform:** A key initial step to improving pedagogical education, even without immediate salary increases, is to sharply reduce the "idiotic huge reporting" burden on teachers and university lecturers, as well as doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. This reporting consumes "thousands [and] millions of people-hours on a national scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   **Societal Coexistence:** After the end of major events, society will have to learn to coexist with "veterans and Putinists," similar to how it currently functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This may involve the formation of veteran unions and political parties, and the continuation of narratives about betrayal, which will persist for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Prognosis for [[potential_political_changes_and_future_leadership_in_russia | Future Political Changes]]
Solovey states that the regime in Russia will change, and the regime in Belarus will follow shortly thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. He predicts a "very sharp, cardinal and large-scale" [[future_political_changes_and_developments_in_russia | political crisis]] in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. While unsure if this will manifest as a revolution or an evolutionary process, he suggests that some peaceful transformations can be equivalent to a revolution, citing Alexander II's reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

He emphasizes that even if Putin's regime leaves, it does not mean democracy will instantly appear; it will be a process that requires effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. While the nature of people changes slowly, cultural models and values can shift relatively quickly, within 10-15 years, as demonstrated by world history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

Solovey also expresses confidence that Russia will become a democratic republican state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>. He highlights that despite current difficulties, "Victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

### Opposition and Elite Dynamics
*   **North Korea Scenario:** Solovey believes Russia turning into a "plague Barack" (implying a North Korea-like isolated state) is "extremely unlikely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Even within the ruling elite and security services, there are few who desire this path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. The Russian establishment desires to enjoy the world and not live in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
*   **Elite Interference:** There is a higher probability now than six months prior that elements within Putin's inner circle might interfere with orders, especially concerning the use of tactical nuclear weapons, as they do not want Russia to become a permanent pariah state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

### Specific Predictions and Concerns
*   **Crimea:** The fate of Crimea depends on military dynamics, and scenarios presented to the Russian president do not exclude Crimea turning into a battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
*   **Transnistria:** There is a "very high" chance of changing Transnistria's current status within the next five years, linked to Russia's internal crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. It's unlikely Russia will be able to hold Transnistria during its period of crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.
*   **Military Offensive:** A massive Russian offensive in several directions is planned for late February or March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This will likely involve a series of offensive and counter-offensive actions stretching over several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Putin is timing significant speeches and steps, such as the introduction of martial law and announcements of a second stage of mobilization, to coincide with the anniversary of the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
*   **Conscripts:** While legally forbidden to mobilize conscripts or send them to active duty, Solovey would not rule out anything if a massive offensive with large human losses unfolds, especially under visible martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>.
*   **Borders and Mobilization:** Putin did not close borders after the first mobilization due to a lack of a clear legal "base" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>. Now, a base exists, including 8 million people financially unable to leave (due to overdue loans and alimony) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>, plus a growing potential mobilization base that could reach 7 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>. He notes that mobilization is "creeping" and has not been canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>.
*   **Chinese Aggression:** If Russia critically weakens, Solovey would not rule out Chinese actions, not as "aggression," but as filling demographic voids in sparsely populated parts of Russia, especially given further demographic sparseness due to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
*   **Putin's Doubles:** The existence of doubles could mean that Putin's death might not be immediately known, as they were prepared to control the situation for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.
*   **State-Owned Companies:** Companies like Gazprom should first get truly effective management and work in public national interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>. Partial privatization could be considered later, when prices rise and the market recovers, to ensure sales at a good price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:42">[01:05:42]</a>.
*   **Lenin's Body:** Solovey believes Lenin's body should be reburied in a military cemetery, alongside other country leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>.

At the close of the year, Russian President Vladimir Putin notably refused to participate in several traditionally held large-scale public events [00:01:35]. This included the cancellation of a New Year's reception and a major press conference, while his message to the Federal Assembly also remained uncertain [00:01:45].

## Reasons for Cancellations

Three primary reasons are cited for the cessation of these public appearances:

### Lack of Answers and Fear of Unwanted Questions
The first reason given is that President Putin has "nothing to say" in response to potential pressing questions [00:01:58]. Even with filtered questions during a press conference, there remains a risk of "unwanted questions appearing" [00:02:09]. It is suggested that any truthful question for the President of the Russian Federation is currently "unwanted" [00:02:15].

### Health Concerns
The second reason relates to the President's health [00:02:23]. He is reportedly "not able to withstand a long, hours of intense stress" associated with answering questions at a press conference or "Direct Line" event [00:02:25]. Doctors are said to have advised against exposing "the only support of Russia, the embodiment of Russia" to such health risks [00:02:47].

### Security and Caution
The third reason is a general sense of "caution" or "fear" within the Kremlin [00:02:54]. This fear is linked to the alleged capability of Ukrainian aircraft to penetrate deep into Russian territory, coupled with the Russian system's inability to identify, detain, or intercept these aircraft in the air [00:03:06]. The concern is that if a message to the Federal Assembly were being delivered, "unidentified aircraft" might appear over the Kremlin, causing panic [00:03:33]. The speaker metaphorically notes that "some people have diapers... will be soiled in this" situation [00:03:47].

## Future Appearances and Security Measures
Given these concerns, discussions have reportedly taken place regarding alternative formats for public addresses. One option is to hold the message to the Federal Assembly virtually, with the President in a "safe place" [00:04:01].

For security reasons, the ceremonial New Year's reception was also canceled [00:04:17]. President Putin reportedly intends to celebrate New Year "deep underground," "far from Moscow and generally beyond the Urals," hoping that no unknown aircraft will reach him there [00:04:25]. The possibility of addressing the Federal Assembly from this "absolutely protected place" via video link is considered [00:04:40]. The speaker questions whether Putin would "expose" the Federal Assembly members to the same risks as himself [00:05:14].

## Broader [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | Political Dynamics]]
The cancellation of these events and the emphasis on security reflect a broader shift in [[russian_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Russian political dynamics]], with the country being transformed into a "military camp" [00:09:00]. This includes elements of martial law and increased mobilization [00:14:07].

Sociological data suggests that despite the state's efforts to ideologically promote a "people's war" through propaganda, TV viewers have largely turned away from talk shows and are seeking "entertainment content" [00:20:04]. This indicates a public weariness with the "hysteria" of official propagandists and a desire to "forget about what is happening outside of Russia," particularly in Ukraine [00:20:48].

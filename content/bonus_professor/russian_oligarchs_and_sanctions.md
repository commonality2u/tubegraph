The March 4th broadcast of the "Feigin Life" channel discussed the impact of sanctions on Russian oligarchs, dubbing the situation "the last chance for the oligarchs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Immediate Impact of Sanctions

The [[the_impact_of_western_and_european_sanctions_on_russia | Russian oligarchy]] has been "squeezed" by sanctions, with the USA including "practically all the main figures" in their lists. This includes individuals like Usmanov, Mordashov, Timchenko, and Berg, who are considered part of "Putin's entourage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The focus of these sanctions has been on "old school old families" who were "very well preserved" from the Yeltsin era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Differentiated Western Approach

The West employs a "differentiated approach" to sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. There are "seasoned ones" like Timchenko, Rotenberg, and Kovalchuk, towards whom the West is "merciless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This first group is "crossed out" by the West and "should disappear" as a subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

However, some oligarchs, like Abramovich, have been left with "some leeway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Abramovich was not formally sanctioned by the US, and not all of his assets were frozen, giving him an "opportunity to decide the issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. He was advised by Great Britain to sell assets and avoid London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. It's noted that a "huge amount of money was given to Valin" to avoid sanctions, amounting to "hundreds of millions of pounds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Freezing assets and travel bans "greatly complicates any situation, personal and business" for these individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Abramovich's public statement about his "indirect part in attempts to establish negotiations between Moscow and Kiev" is seen as a means to avoid sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

The West's strategy appears to be to push these oligarchs to act against Russia's actions in Ukraine and potentially influence "Putin and the war in Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, or at least prevent him from "pressing the red button" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Lack of Oligarchic Influence

Despite sanctions and immense pressure, many oligarchs are considered "helpless" in political terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. For the past two years, "none of them are close to the president anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Only a limited number of individuals, like Kovalchuk, Rotenberg, and Timchenko, can still meet with Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Others, like Sobyanin and Valentin Yumashev, can no longer meet him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

There is a "non-aggression pact" between the old elite and the government: the elite "do not attack," "do not finance the opposition," and "do not engage fingers in investing," while "the Chekists and Putin does not touch people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

The idea that oligarchs could influence generals or the General Staff is dismissed as "completely noticeable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, as Putin's "guards" prevent any "enemy" penetration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

The speaker believes that any success in an "elite conspiracy or coup" can only happen if "some movement starts below," and if they are "synchronized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Currently, even with a "knife to the throat," an oligarch "will not be able to do anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

### Loss of Influence Instruments
The instruments of influence for oligarchs have disappeared in Russia, as there are "no more independent media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The state has effectively eliminated alternative viewpoints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Public opinion leaders are stifled, and "anything that pisses you off will be considered seditious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The ability to "consolidate the street" has vanished, making calls for public action ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

## Future of Sanctions and Economic Hardship

The West's strategy is to "increase pressure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>, with sanctions expected to "spread both in breadth and in depth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>, capturing "all new groups" and involving "family relations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. This includes "second row of oligarchs" who are less politically visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.

The current situation is defined as an [[economic_sanctions_and_their_effects_on_russia | economic war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. Putin understands this and is preparing an "asymmetric response," which is why "nuclear forces have been put on high alert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

The [[russian_economic_issues_and_potential_crises | Russian economy]] is expected to face severe consequences:
*   **Mass Unemployment**: "Mass unemployment" is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, with the potential introduction of "labor armies" or "labor service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   **Shortages**: There may be "shortage of food" and "interruptions in logistics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Crisis**: "Very serious problems" are expected with the "provision of medicines" and medical consumables due to import restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
*   **Deficit**: The current generation will learn "what a deficit is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.
*   **Inflation**: High deposit rates (21% on ruble deposits) indicate an expected inflation of "fifty-sixty percent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. The "charm" of the 90s will likely be felt by the end of summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

It is predicted that the [[impacts_of_war_and_sanctions_on_russia | situation will deteriorate sharply]] and be "spasmodic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. The [[economic_sanctions_and_their_effects_on_russia | sanctions]] are not expected to be lifted even if escalation stops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

## Role of Propaganda and Public Opinion

Despite the unfolding crisis, propaganda is still "working" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. People often give "socially approved answers" in surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. Many Russians "do not want to see unacceptable" realities and "do not want to hear" negative information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.

However, the increasing number of deaths in the military campaign, which diverges significantly from official figures, is a critical factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. While some believe people are "downtrodden" and won't react, others argue that mass casualties will change public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:07">[00:29:07]</a>. Compensation payments of "seven million for the dead" and "3 for the wounded" are seen as a way to "shut up many people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>.

The totality of factors – losses, mobilization, and economic hardship – is what is expected to drive change, rather than any single element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>. Mass mobilization of "hundreds of thousands of people" would be "very noticeable" and could lead to raids and the demonization of "draft dodgers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a>.

## Restrictions on Movement and Information

Measures are already in place to restrict movement. Border service personnel and FSB operatives are conducting "conversations" with people at airports, checking phones for social media content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>. A ban on leaving the country is expected, initially for "conscripts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. There have been instances where "up to half of the students disappeared" from male groups in elite educational institutions in Moscow, having "simply left the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:50">[00:41:50]</a>. Exit visas and interviews are anticipated as a next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>.

Information control is tightening, with Facebook and Twitter already blocked and YouTube being targeted for "final blocking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

### Repressions and Loyalty
Repressions are expected to "maintain total loyalty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>. Beyond "disloyal leaders" and bloggers, the state will target "mass groups" once dissatisfaction becomes evident, even "for a joke" to intimidate people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.

## Occult Scenario and Predictions

There is a discussion about whether Putin's actions are driven by an "occult scenario" rather than rational logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>. It is suggested that while his starting point might be "stupid" for external observers, he operates with an "iron logic" from his own mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a>. This includes being influenced by those who "say what you want to hear" and provide "strength" and "drive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

Astrologers and specialists are said to have "studied for a very long time" this operation, with calculations that "everything comes together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>. A period of "very difficult time" and "nuclear threat" is predicted at the beginning, with August being "very scary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>. The next "six months" are expected to be "very hard," and the situation will "get worse and worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

While a "world government" does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>, there are non-public organizations that exert significant [[role_of_nonpublic_and_secretive_organizations_in_global_politics | influence]] on the global economy and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>.

## Nature and Scope of Influence
These non-public organizations number no more than a dozen and a half, possibly even fewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>. They do not influence publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>, but rather through:
*   Individuals they bring into governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>
*   Top managers or owners of corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a>
*   Intellectual trusts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>
*   Advisers to key figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>

### Cooperation and Impact
These organizations are in a state of "positive neutrality," meaning they can assist one another and generally do not engage in confrontation, though there were past periods when they did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>. Their role is largely positive, aiming to maintain global balance and prevent excessive disruptions that could lead to widespread destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. For example, their collective support for the late President Putin helped prevent a much worse scenario for Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. They do not function as a [[world_financial_elite_influence | world government]] nor do they divide spheres of influence, but they successfully reach agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

## Public Perception of "World Government"
Approximately half of Russians believe in the existence of a [[world_financial_elite_influence | world government]], a belief that has remained stable for over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>. However, when asked about its purpose, individuals often become confused, though they generally perceive its goals towards Russia as negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. Identifying the members of such a government also proves difficult for most, with common responses including the American president, the late Queen Elizabeth, and the Pope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>.

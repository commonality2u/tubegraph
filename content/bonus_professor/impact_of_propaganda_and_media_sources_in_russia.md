## Theatricality and Propaganda in Public Appearances

Recent public events involving Russian leadership, such as President Putin's meeting with mothers, widows, and wives of servicemen involved in the special military operation in Ukraine, have been widely criticized for their deliberate and low-quality theatricality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Despite significant resources, the organization of these events is often so poor that even an "undemanding viewer" can discern their staged nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## President Putin's Worldview on Sacrifice

A key phrase uttered by President Putin, implying that dying in conflict is preferable to dying from vodka or in an accident, reveals a profound lack of empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This perspective, where he assumes the right to decide who lives or dies, reflects a complete absence of understanding for the suffering of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people who have lost lives or whose families face an uncertain future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

This viewpoint embodies Freud's concept of the "desire for death and destruction," with Putin acting as a "priest of Thanatos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. He essentially urges people to "go and die," not for the Motherland, but for himself, reflecting a [[state_propaganda_and_media_influence_in_russia | state's worldview]] where "This is me, President Putin, and by dying for the Motherland, you die for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The primary goal for those in conflict is thus presented as dying for Putin rather than living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Preparing for Further Mobilization

The Russian leadership is aware that the armed confrontation will intensify and needs a new stage of mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Signs indicate preparations are underway, including a presidential decree published last week for the creation of an integrated database of military personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. While the database is slated for full readiness by April 2024, the digitization of military registration and enlistment office data is expected to be completed by December 25 of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This aligns with earlier information that the second stage of mobilization and the introduction of martial law are planned for after the winter holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

The consistent denial by officials like Peskov and even President Putin about the need for further mobilization is interpreted as strong indirect confirmation of existing plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This "persistent denial is the best proof" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, echoing past false assurances regarding retirement age, constitutional changes, or armed confrontation with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Reputational Damage and Diplomatic Isolation

The Collective Security Treaty Organization (DKB) summit, attended by Putin, was another reputational setback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan's refusal to sign the final declaration signals Armenia's likely departure from the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Photographs from the summit notably show a greater distance between Putin and other leaders compared to the distance among the other participants, suggesting they are "avoiding the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This instinctive reaction followed the European Parliament's resolution calling Russia a "terrorist state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. While the resolution itself has no immediate practical consequences, it directly impacts Russia's reputation, as other countries fear reputational and economic repercussions (e.g., extended sanctions) from being associated with the leader of a "declared terrorist state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## The Death of Vladimir Makei: A Warning to Allies

The sudden death of Vladimir Makei, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, officially attributed to a heart attack, is believed by reliable sources to be a murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Makei was reportedly "too successful" a negotiator in facilitating communication between the Belarusian leadership and Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. During these negotiations, Belarus reportedly expressed readiness to make political concessions to restore relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. There were even hints from Lukashenko that changes would soon occur in Russia, leading to democratic shifts in Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

Makei's assassination effectively blocked this diplomatic track, acting as a "black mark" or hint to Belarusian President Lukashenko about the consequences for those who attempt to distance themselves from Russia's close embrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Media Trust in Russia

Recent sociological surveys present a complex picture of [[public_opinion_and_its_impact_on_russian_political_dynamics | public opinion]] in Russia. While some surveys showed a high and growing level of optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, others indicated that anxious moods among Russians grew from 49% to 56% in a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This apparent contradiction can be explained by:
*   **Socially Approved Answers:** People may give responses they believe sociologists want to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Schizophrenia of Consciousness:** A fragmented or torn consciousness is characteristic, especially for people in Russia now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Information Sources:** Optimists and pessimists are largely divided by their key sources of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## The Role of Television in Shaping Reality

For optimists, television is the primary source of information, presenting a "rich, prosperous Russia" that overcomes difficulties and confidently moves towards "complete, final Victory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This [[impact_of_political_propaganda_in_russia | political propaganda]] via television serves to inject optimism and simultaneously induce a "psychosis" by constantly highlighting external enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. This narrative fosters suspicion, even leading to concerns about [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | foreign agents]] within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

## Shifting Trust Towards Online Sources

A survey conducted for World Television Day in cities with over 100,000 people revealed a notable shift in trust:
*   Internet media: 48% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>
*   Social networks and Telegram channels: 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>
*   Television: 36% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>
*   Radio/print media: 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>

This contrasts sharply with a Levada Center poll from August, where television was trusted by 51% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This discrepancy is attributed to two factors:
1.  **Urban Audience:** The bank's poll focused on cities, where the audience is more susceptible to the influence of Internet media and social networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
2.  **Recent Events:** The period between the two polls saw the successful Ukrainian counteroffensive and partial mobilization, leading to an increased level of fear and anxiety in Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

Despite the shift in trust, actual behavioral changes based on this data are not yet widely observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. It's also important to note that even the internet space often reflects the agenda set by television and official media, as news aggregators like Yandex are under state control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

## Growing Disgust with Propaganda

A significant finding from the Otkritie bank survey is that 54% of respondents named "public talk shows" as their least favorite television programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. This signals an "alarming signal for the Russian [[impact_of_political_propaganda_in_russia | propaganda]] system," indicating that people are becoming increasingly "sick of this [[impact_of_propaganda_on_russian_society | propaganda]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. This disgust could evolve into hatred and a complete rejection of these sources of propaganda, along with aggression towards those who promote such views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

## Economic Hardship and Societal Implications

The social situation in Russia is further exacerbated by economic hardship. According to Ramir research, expenses on food and everyday goods for the average Russian household reached almost 48% of their budget in October, a 6.5% increase from a year ago and a record high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This means nearly half of an average family's income is spent just on "existing" or "surviving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. This leaves significantly less for entertainment, medical treatment, or self-investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

This economic reality contributes to a "slave state" where a significant portion of the population works merely to eat and pay off a mortgage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] The "Slogan"
> "Live as a slave and die for the Russian president" is presented as the underlying, unpronounced slogan guiding Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

## A Call to Face the Truth

The current state is described as "monstrous," with many people either not understanding or being afraid to admit what is happening, as it would lead to a "terrible admission" and a "devaluation of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. The speaker urges people to "face the truth" sooner or later to avoid a collective march towards an undesirable fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.

The political future of [[lukashenko_and_early_presidential_elections_in_belarus | Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko]] is closely tied to the [[future_of_russias_political_landscape | political dynamics in Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Current Support and Russian Relations

Nikolai Patrushev, as of the recording, is noted to have a "bad irritation and disbelief" towards Alexander Lukashenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. Despite this personal sentiment, Patrushev is not currently prepared to quarrel with Lukashenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Patrushev's immediate focus is on consolidating power on "external tracks," and he does not intend to quarrel with the few remaining allies, which includes Lukashenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This indicates that despite underlying tensions, Russia's current strategic priorities dictate a continued, albeit perhaps reluctant, support for Lukashenko. This complex relationship is a key aspect of the [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | political situation in Belarus and its relationship with Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

## Impact of Political Change in Russia

It is predicted that if a "radical change of power" occurs in Russia, rather than just a transfer of power within the existing regime, Lukashenko would not remain long at the head of Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. The speaker expresses uncertainty about whether Lukashenko would have the opportunity to flee, for instance, to Beijing, suggesting he might not have enough time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This highlights the significant influence of [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Russian political dynamics and influence in Belarus]] on Lukashenko's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

It is important to note that the forecast about Lukashenko's fate is contingent on a fundamental shift in [[possible_future_political_changes_in_russia | Russia's political system]], not merely a change in leadership within the existing framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

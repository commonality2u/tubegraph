Valery Solovey introduced the 48th episode of his program, "What's Happening," on Monday, January 16, focusing on the "demobilization chord of General Gerasimov" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Context of the Military Situation

The current military situation in relations between Russia and Ukraine is described as "getting worse and worse every day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Despite what was termed a "spectacular victory" of the Russian armed forces in the capture of Salidar, the assault for which began in August, the situation on the fronts is "not so good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. It is noted that Berlin was taken "much faster" than Salidar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Vladimir Putin understands that the situation is unfavorable and that the "special war, an operation, it is time to somehow end it" victoriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## General Gerasimov's New Role

### Appointment and Qualifications
General Gerasimov was appointed as the Chief of the General Staff and commander of a group of Russian troops in the special military operation zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. He is considered the "best Russian General" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, an "excellent planner," a "person with strategic thinking," and an author or co-author of the concept of hybrid warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Putin has reportedly "endowed him with special emergency powers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. In return for these powers, Putin "demanded one to ensure victory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The meaning of "victory" is an "open question," possibly referring to "honorable conditions of peace personally of President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The ability of General Gerasimov to achieve this desired victory remains to be seen in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Reasons for Appointment
There are two main reasons for Gerasimov's appointment:
1.  **Purely Military**: The challenging situation on the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
2.  **Military-Political**: The excessive strengthening of Yevgeny Prigozhin, Putin's protégé <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Prigozhin has amassed "a whole galaxy of influential ill-wishers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, who have voiced concerns to the president about his growing influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Gerasimov is described as one of Prigozhin's opponents and antagonists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Prigozhin's Wagner fighters suffered significant losses during the assault on Salidar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
    *   Putin is not interested in Prigozhin being "removed from circulation" as he is a "reliable" and "effective tool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
    *   However, Prigozhin himself is preparing for Putin's future, forming a resource base, controlling finances, media resources, and enjoying political weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. His attempts to form a military resource led to "unexpected refurbishment" from the president and parts of the elite who viewed his excessive strengthening as "useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Upcoming Military Dynamics

Both sides are preparing for offensives in the spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   **Russian Strategy**: Could involve a combination of strategic defense against a Ukrainian offensive, followed by a transition to a counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Ukrainian Strategy**: Could be the opposite, allowing Russian troops to go on the offensive, become exhausted, and then launch a counterattack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Ukraine is expected to receive tanks, which are considered a "breakthrough weapon," and is also preparing for an offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

These events in the steppes of Ukraine are anticipated to be the "most significant military battle of the 21st century" and will "predetermine the outcome of the armed confrontation" between the Russian Federation and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The outcome and fate of associations like the CSTO will largely depend on these military dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. If Russia suffers a defeat (crushing or moderate), the CSTO would lose its meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## Related Military and Economic Considerations

### Mobilization
A "new stage of mobilization" is being prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Despite denials from officials like Dmitry Peskov, who dismiss rumors of mobilization as "sabotage and provocations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, contradictory information emerges. For example, deferments for fathers of many children were canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The upper limit of conscription for military service is expected to increase to 30 years from 21 in the spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, which is described as a "hidden form of mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. The issue of increasing military service length to two years is also being discussed and is likely to be resolved positively by the fall draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

The Times, citing MI6, reported that Russia is preparing for a second stage of mobilization, potentially stretched into several parts, with the first wave mobilizing up to half a million people and a total of up to 2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This extensive mobilization and preparations for an offensive and increased military service length suggest that Russia anticipates a "long confrontation with Ukraine or with the whole world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Russia is leveraging its demographic resource, being three to three and a half times larger than Ukraine's population, to "resettle Ukraine more in the army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Economic Resources
The duration of the operation raises questions about economic resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. Russia's main foreign exchange supplier is oil and gas exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. Russian Urals oil, accounting for two-thirds of its oil exports, fell below $40 per barrel (to $38.7) around 10 days prior, a record low since summer 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This decline will lead to "serious problems" for the budget and decreasing export revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. With a price ceiling introduced from February 5, Russia could lose between $100 billion and $180 billion in foreign exchange earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. These budget losses will likely be compensated "at our expense" (the public's expense), as armed forces and security services (Russian Guard, police, FSB, Federal Protective Service) will be financed to the maximum, while social expenses and economic development spending will be cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. This is likened to the mid-20th century concept of "guns instead of oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. To compensate for losses, Russia is attempting to increase oil exports, with January exports sharply increasing by one and a half times compared to December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

### Strange Deaths in Defense Industry
A series of "strange deaths" in Russia's defense industry occurred over three weeks:
*   **January 9**: Pavel Kamenev, scientific director of Almaz Antey and developer of "Caliber" missiles, died at 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **December 28**: Vladimir Nesterov, general director of the Khrunichev center and leader of the heavy missile project, died at 73 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **December 24**: Alexander Buzakov, general director of the Admiralty shipyards and manufacturer of "Caliber" missiles, died at 66 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

These three deaths of individuals involved in defense industry design work are seen as more than a coincidence, similar to "suicides or strange deaths of SL employees last year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

### Putin's Alleged Use of Doubles
There are "evil but very knowledgeable tongues" reporting that the Russian president's alleged trip to Ufa to say goodbye to the first Bashkir president, Murtaza Rakhimov, was actually undertaken by "one of his doubles," specifically the "first main double of the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. This double reportedly "very successfully coped with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. This situation is compared to Akira Kurosawa's film *Kagemusha* (Shadow Warrior), where a double replaces a killed feudal prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. The speaker notes that such a practice of using doubles existed in medieval Japan and "a number of countries," not only "the modern Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>.

The speaker concludes by stating that 2023 "can become very" significant, and it will be the year when a chance will open up "to decisively influence our destiny, the destiny of our people and our country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>, expressing confidence that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

[[potential_involvement_of_nato_in_the_conflict | NATO]] is reportedly preparing for a hybrid war with the Russian Federation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>

## Russian Strategy
The Russian military-political leadership, particularly a segment of it, is thought to be considering changing the strategic context of the conflict with Ukraine. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> The aim is to distract the attention of the West and [[potential_involvement_of_nato_in_the_conflict | NATO]] to another theater of military operations, similar to what occurred with the Middle East. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a> They believe a new field of tension can be created in Europe, specifically in the Baltic countries of Latvia and Estonia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a> These countries were chosen due to their significant proportion of non-native, or Russian-speaking, populations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>

## Hybrid Operation Characteristics
A hybrid operation, as conceived by Russia, is not a full-fledged military operation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a> The military component is intended to be introduced only at the final stage and should not be significant. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a> The initial stages involve creating chaos. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>

### Tools for Hybrid Warfare
One of the most effective tools in a hybrid operation is cyberattacks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a> These attacks target:
*   Websites of banking institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>
*   Logistics systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>
*   Websites of state and municipal institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>

The Russian Federation has recently been testing its ability to disable these sites and damage navigation systems in the Baltic Sea area. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a> The process is staged, designed to deepen chaos. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a> If [[potential_involvement_of_nato_in_the_conflict | NATO]] does not offer decisive resistance, the operation progresses through stages, eventually incorporating a military component. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>

## [[potential_involvement_of_nato_in_the_conflict | NATO]]'s Response and Concerns
[[potential_involvement_of_nato_in_the_conflict | NATO]] Secretary General Stoltenberg stated in an interview that [[potential_involvement_of_nato_in_the_conflict | NATO]] could invoke Article 5 (collective defense) in the event of a serious cyberattack on a member country. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a> He indicated that Moscow would be warned, and [[potential_involvement_of_nato_in_the_conflict | NATO]] could respond not only in cyberspace but also "in other areas" to protect allies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a> Article 5 of [[potential_involvement_of_nato_in_the_conflict | NATO]] treats an armed attack on one member as an attack on the alliance as a whole. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a> This applies to a response to a hybrid operation, even at its initial stage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>

### Potential for Escalation
Despite [[potential_involvement_of_nato_in_the_conflict | NATO]]'s statements, there is skepticism about its willingness to provide a tough response. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a> [[potential_involvement_of_nato_in_the_conflict | NATO]] may initially react with "deep concern" and calls for restraint. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a> The fear is that if [[potential_involvement_of_nato_in_the_conflict | NATO]] responds to cyberattacks by inflicting its own cyberattacks on Russian sites or by responding in other areas, Russia could declare such actions a threat. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a> This could lead Russia to consider itself entitled to use [[potential_use_of_nuclear_weapons | nuclear weapons]], specifically tactical [[potential_use_of_nuclear_weapons | nuclear weapons]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>

While the current Russian leadership may not be a supporter of using [[potential_use_of_nuclear_weapons | nuclear weapons]], it does utilize [[russias_nuclear_rhetoric_and_natos_cyber_defenses | nuclear rhetoric]] and blackmail. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a> The parties are currently exchanging threats, with Russia testing [[potential_involvement_of_nato_in_the_conflict | NATO]]'s ability to repel a hybrid operation, and [[potential_involvement_of_nato_in_the_conflict | NATO]] affirming its readiness to respond symmetrically and asymmetrically. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>

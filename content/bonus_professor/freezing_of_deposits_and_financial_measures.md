Valery Solovey discusses the internal [[economic_challenges_in_russia | socio-economic problems]] currently facing Russian society and the state, describing them as having taken on an "insoluble nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>. The episode focuses on how authorities intend to deal with this "threatening catastrophe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>.

## Introduction of Social Food Cards

For several months, the introduction of food cards in Russia has been discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:56">[01:56:56]</a>. Initially met with indignation and laughter, these "food social cards" are now becoming common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:02">[02:02:02]</a>. They are set to be introduced in the Kaliningrad region after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:28">[02:38:28]</a>. Aksakov, head of the State Duma for financial markets, proposed extending food cards across all of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:45">[02:45:45]</a>. They are already partially introduced for some items in other cities, notably Kamchatka, where cards for fish are being introduced despite it being a fish-rich region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

Social food cards are theoretically for socially disadvantaged populations, such as pensioners whose income is below the subsistence minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:30">[03:16:30]</a>. However, these cards do not allow recipients to get food for free; instead, they enable purchasing products at "social prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

The introduction of these cards is attributed to serious harvest shortages in the Russian Federation, the most severe in over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. The most acute shortage of provisions is expected in the Trans-Urals and Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

Concerns exist regarding the quality of products obtainable with these cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Reports from Kamchatka indicate that discounted fish available through the cards is of "awful" quality, with meat falling off the bones upon defrosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. It is suggested that these cards will provide "illiquid goods" that need to be offloaded by food chains or manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

Blockquote from the speaker comparing Russian food cards to US food stamps:
> They will immediately tell you. In the United States, 41.5 million people receive these food stamps, food cards, on a regular basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. Yes, dear friends, but they receive provisions on these cards free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. And according to our cards we will need to buy provisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. This is one difference from America, not in our favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. The second difference is the quality of provisions. The provisions that are received according to food cards in the United States are of normal quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.

The speaker expects the card system to be extended nationwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a> due to the difficult situation with provisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. The quality of products for the general population is anticipated to be poor, while the Russian nomenklatura will continue to access high-quality goods through special distribution channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. The core issue is not a complete lack of provisions, but that high-quality provisions will become very expensive, forcing people to buy low-quality ones to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

## Housing Market Challenges

The housing market, typically an indicator of economic health, is in a "pre-catastrophic" state and is expected to become "catastrophic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. The construction industry faces the highest debt growth among industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. This is exacerbated by the Central Bank's key rate increase, which was expected to rise by two points to 23% and then immediately by 10-12 points at the beginning of next year, targeting 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.

Construction companies cannot repay loans and struggle to sell built housing, with approximately 60% of new apartments remaining unsold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. This situation makes the collapse of the construction market and bankruptcies "inevitable," primarily affecting small and medium-sized companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. Large developers may survive by reducing their workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>. For example, one owner of "Airplane," a major Moscow developer, is urgently trying to sell their share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>.

The collapse will impact related industries and those working within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>. There is concern for people who bought apartments at the excavation stage, facing the prospect of unfinished housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. While housing prices might initially decrease as developers try to sell off inventory, inflation is expected to cause prices to rise later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>.

### Inflation Forecasts

Inflation forecasts are severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. For 2022, unofficial inflation data suggest prices almost doubled, compared to official data of 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[14:24:00]</a>. For the next year, an inflation growth of 100% to 200% is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>. The speaker predicts that the current currency exchange rates (108 rubles per dollar, 115-116 per euro) will seem low in a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>.

## Freezing of Deposits

A significant aspect of the impending [[economic_crisis_and_currency_valuation_in_russia | crisis]] is the discussion of various scenarios for [[freezing_of_deposits_and_financial_challenges | freezing deposits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>. The "Cypriot scenario" is the most intensively discussed and closest to implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>.

### Cypriot Scenario for Deposits
*   **Insurance Amount**: The current insurance amount in Russia is 1,400,000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>. The average deposit in Russia is around 560,000-580,000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. Even if money is spread across multiple banks, the total deposit per person will be considered for the 1,400,000 ruble limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>.
*   **Conversion to Shares**: Everything exceeding 1,400,000 rubles will be converted into bank shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. However, these shares will be frozen, meaning depositors will not be able to dispose of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>.
*   **Impact and State Expectation**: As of 2022, 98.3% of depositors had funds entirely below 1,400,000 rubles; this figure is now slightly less than 97.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>. The state anticipates a neutral reaction from society, even approval, as the majority of people would not be significantly affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>. Those with deposits over 10 million rubles account for almost a third of total deposits, and those from 3 million to 10 million account for 15.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.
*   **Restrictions**: Even for the insured amount, there will likely be restrictions on cash withdrawals and non-cash payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:26:00">[18:26:00]</a>.

This measure is seen as absolutely necessary by the elite, and its implementation is believed to be the only alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>. The timing depends on the pace of the [[economic_crisis_and_currency_valuation_in_russia | economic catastrophe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: Coping with Crisis
The current Russian authorities intend to cope with the impending [[economic_challenges_in_russia | economic catastrophe]] using "Old Soviet," even "Bolshevik patterns," which include deficits, food cards, special distributors, and "taking money from the population" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:11]</a>. The strategy is to escape the crisis at the expense of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>.

### Advice for [[economic_challenges_faced_by_russian_households | Russian Households]]
The speaker suggests creating local networks of mutual aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>. People might need to take turns waiting in lines for social products, reminiscent of the Soviet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>. A specific call is made to middle and younger generations to assist elderly parents and relatives, as they will be most affected by the crisis, especially the food crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>. This assistance can start with regular phone calls or visits to check on their well-being and needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:46:00">[22:46:00]</a>. These actions are presented as preparations that can be made without significant material costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:15:00">[23:15:00]</a>.

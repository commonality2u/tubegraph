Predictions indicate Russia is on the verge of a significant [[political_changes_in_russia_post_putin | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This [[political_transition_in_r2 | political transition]] is expected to bring about profound changes in its social and political landscape.

## Economic and Social Impacts of the Impending Crisis
During the unfolding of the anticipated [[political_transition_in_russia | political crisis]], people are likely to shift towards defensive assets like currency or gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Currencies are predicted to rise in value, while real estate prices in Moscow are expected to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The duration of this crisis will determine the long-term trends; if it's relatively short-lived, real estate might see a rebound upon exiting the crisis, while currency values could stabilize or decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For those considering leaving Russia, selling real estate now might be advisable, given declining demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. However, holding real estate for a couple of years could prove to be a winning strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Pension Reform and Social Support
A new government in Russia will need to address the pension system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Key measures include:
*   Canceling the increased retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   Providing compensation for those who lost benefits due to the retirement age increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   Increasing pensions by reducing "non-productive expenses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
While pensions can be made more "decent," a radical increase (2-3 times) is unlikely in the near future without a comprehensive pension system reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The previous "reform" was merely an increase in the retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## [[Potential changes in Russias political landscape | Political Changes and Governance]]
The current regime in Russia is expected to change, with a subsequent shift in the regime in Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.
Key aspects of [[political_changes_in_russia_post_putin | post-Putin Russia]] include:
*   **Legal Reforms**: All laws and by-laws that violated fundamental human rights will be cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
*   **Accountability**: Those responsible for developing, initiating, and inspiring these oppressive laws will face legal punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>.
*   **Restoration of Rights**: A dedicated service, possibly within the Ministry of Internal Affairs or as a separate entity, will be established to protect citizens' rights and restore constitutional legality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.
*   **Compensation**: Individuals whose rights suffered will receive compensation, a process that will be systematic and long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.
*   **Nature of Transition**: The future of Russia could involve a "political crisis" which might lead to either a revolution or evolutionary process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. Peaceful transformations equivalent to revolutions are possible, similar to the great reforms of Alexander II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.

## Sociocultural Landscape and Public Attitudes
The [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | socio-cultural landscape]] of Russia, including for its elite, has changed significantly over the past 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. The establishment desires to enjoy the world and not live in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

### Risk of "North Korea" Scenario
The speaker considers the scenario of Russia turning into a "plague Barack" (North Korea-like state) as "extremely unlikely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Even within the ruling elite and Chekists, there is no widespread desire for such a path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. While a group, possibly influenced by Nikolai Patrushev, encourages this option, they are not the sole decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

### Informing and Societal Climate
The speaker believes that the current encouragement of informing (denunciations) is a state-driven policy, and as soon as the state ceases to encourage such a climate and administrative-police pressure, the need for denunciations will disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

### Future of Russian Society
After the major events conclude, society will likely continue to coexist, with veterans and "Putinists" forming their own unions and political parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Narratives of betrayal and near-victory will persist for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. Russia will ultimately become a democratic republican state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:51">[01:07:51]</a>.

## External Influence on Russia's Future
Russians living abroad have limited opportunities to influence the future of Russia at present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. Their primary roles are financial assistance to worthy causes (people, organizations, initiatives) and protecting the interests of Russian political prisoners through protests and solidarity events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. However, when the situation in Russia changes radically, both politically and economically, their knowledge, technologies (including management), experience, and money will be invaluable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. Russia will become a country with "very high margin," offering significant earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>.

## Key Predictions and Outlook
*   **Political Crisis**: A serious [[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | political crisis]] is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Military Events**: Decisive military events in favor of Ukraine are expected from March to summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Weapons**: The possibility of Russia using tactical nuclear weapons could move to a "practical plane" if Russian armed forces suffer a crushing defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:5:20">[01:5:20]</a>. However, there's a growing probability that people from Putin's entourage might try to prevent this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>.
*   **Succession**: The current leader is "mending," and some, like Nikolai and Dmitry Patrushev, are keenly awaiting a potential announcement of a successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>.
*   **Future of Transnistria**: There is a high chance of a change in Transnistria's current status within the next five years, linked to the crisis in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>.
*   **Chinese Influence**: If Russia critically weakens, the possibility of China filling demographic voids in sparsely populated parts of Russia is not ruled out, comparing it to "water" filling emptiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.
*   **Year of Decision**: The year 2023 has a strong chance of being a decisive year, offering an opportunity to influence the country's destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>.

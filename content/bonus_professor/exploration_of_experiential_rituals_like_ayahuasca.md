Experiential rituals, particularly those involving substances like Ayahuasca, are presented as a complex practice with both authentic traditions and modern, commercialized interpretations. Andrey Kosmach, a specialist in [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_Russia | occultism and magical practices]], discusses these rituals, noting their growing popularity, especially among the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Ayahuasca: Mythological Concepts and Components

According to mythological concepts, Ayahuasca is considered a "gift from the gods to people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>. This divine gift is intended only for specific individuals, and revealing its secret to outsiders is believed to anger the gods, potentially leading to punishment for the entire tribe with diseases and difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:33">[00:55:33]</a>. Individual sanctions may also be introduced against convention violators by tribal elders or shamans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:58">[00:55:58]</a>.

An authentic "drink of the gods" (Ayahuasca) consists of only two components:
*   **Liana *Banisteriopsis caapi***: Contains harmine and related alkaloids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>.
*   ***Psychotria viridis***: Contains dimethyltryptamine (DMT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.

The preparation of this drink takes many hours, exclusively during daylight, and is consumed after sunset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.

## Authentic vs. Pseudo-Rituals

Authentic Ayahuasca rituals are performed exclusively in special ceremonies that do not happen very often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>. Most of the time, even tribes use a "variation method of preparation" which can include over 30 different components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>. The true essence of the ritual lies not in the alkaloids or components, but in the strict sequence of the ritual itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>.

### Stages of the Authentic Ritual
The ritual sequence, which is carefully guarded, consists of three main stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:07">[00:58:07]</a>:
1.  **Preparation (Pre-ceremony)**: Participants are given "entheogens" (plant-based products influencing the psyche) to "reset consciousness" and prepare for a full-fledged trance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>. This alkaloid helps prevent a psychodynamic or abstract experience, known as "walking through the evening fog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a>.
2.  **Transpersonal Trip (During ceremony)**: After exiting the "allegorical fog" state, Ayahuasca is consumed, initiating a "full-fledged transpersonal trip" where "the boundaries of space and time disappear" and the journey within oneself or into the universe begins, lasting 4-6 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>.
3.  **Return (Post-ceremony)**: Upon completion, another entheogen is given to allow the "eternal spirit to return to its body" and avoid getting lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.

Modern "pseudo-elite" participants are generally unaware of these fundamental stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.

### Commercialization and "Pseudo-Ayahuasca"
The temptation of money has led many Amazonian tribes to commercialize these rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>. Instead of authentic hallucinogens, wealthy "pilgrims" are offered complex decoctions that only simulate the effects of true Ayahuasca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>.

#### The "Tourist" Experience
A typical journey for rich "compatriots" seeking healing and other benefits is described:
1.  **Arrival**: Private helicopter flights to a designated platform, followed by a boat journey to an "ethnographic village" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>. This village is specifically built for such events and is usually uninhabited, brought to "imitation of life" only for these occasions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.
2.  **Ceremony**: Pilgrims are greeted by villagers to the sounds of ritual drums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:20">[01:02:20]</a>. In the evening, amid songs and dances, they drink the offered Ayahuasca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>.
3.  **Outcome**: Participants experience "high-quality hallucinosis" generated by their own brains, receiving "answers to all exclusively questions that interest them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>. The next morning, they return "tired satisfied" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>.

These sessions are essentially a "commercial project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>, with "shamans" acting as charlatans who will travel anywhere (e.g., Moscow, Toronto) and tell clients what they want to hear, often through a translator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:43">[01:05:43]</a>. This is described as a form of "psychotherapy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>.

#### Cost and Motivation
The price tag for these "respectable shamans for respectable gentlemen" starts from half a million dollars, potentially reaching several million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>. These high fees are justified by the fact that clients often arrive via private jets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>. Participants are described as "thirsty but very rich fools" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:36">[01:05:36]</a>.

The motivation for engaging in such practices by high-ranking Russian officials, including the president, is discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>. One official stated that "Satanism for me as a tool justification of the present and the prospect of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>, viewing it as a necessity, much like attending a party meeting in Soviet times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[01:05:07]</a>. This indicates a desire for reassurance and a "placebo effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.

## Advanced Trance Methods

Some members of the Russian "pseudo-elite" consider Amazonian Ayahuasca rituals "atavism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:39">[01:03:39]</a> and opt for "advanced" trance methods involving other hallucinogens for "reptiloid flights to Nibiru" or connecting with "Sirius" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>. These include:
*   Colorado toad (*Bufo alvarius*) toxin (bufotenin mixed with DMT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:16">[01:04:16]</a>.
*   Lysergic acid derivatives (e.g., from ergot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.
*   Psilocybin mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:44">[01:04:44]</a>.

These practices, similar to the [[occult_practices_in_Russian_politics | occult practices in Russian politics]] and [[shamanic_rituals_related_to_the_kremlin | shamanic rituals related to the Kremlin]], are largely for self-deception and group psychotherapy, aiming to legitimize power claims by asserting support from "higher powers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. They provide temporary calming but no lasting change or actual influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.

The Russian political and economic system has shown surprising resilience despite sanctions imposed nearly three years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This survivability is attributed to several factors:

*   **Gradual Sanction Implementation** Sanctions were not imposed immediately but gradually, allowing the [[Economic and Financial Challenges in Russia | Russian economy]] and political system to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This is likened to slowly cooking a frog, which manages to adapt until it begins to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Economic Safety Margin** The Russian economy possessed a higher-than-expected safety margin due to unaccounted resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Patience of the People** The endurance and patience of the Russian Federation's people have repeatedly allowed authorities to navigate problems and survive crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. However, this patience is now described as "on the verge of exhaustion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Impending Financial Measures

There is an expectation that the [[Freezing of deposits and financial measures | freezing of deposits and accounts]] is an "uncontested" and "only alternative" measure for the Russian financial and banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. This is considered necessary regardless of who is in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The financial and banking system is currently in a "catastrophic state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

It is anticipated that freezing deposits will lead to a collapse of consumption and create a desperate situation for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. The purpose of such a decision is to "fill the economic vessels with money blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

#### Details on Freezing Deposits

*   **Timing:** The freezing of deposits is expected around spring and summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. If a new government comes to power before summer, a "vegetarian option" (softer scenario) for freezing deposits will likely be chosen, which would not significantly harm the majority of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>. However, a tough or "cruel" scenario would impact many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>.
*   **Brokerage Accounts and Shares:** Brokerage accounts are expected to be frozen, at least temporarily, to prevent money transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. The stock market and shares would experience significant shocks during such events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
*   **Pensions and Salaries:** Pensions and salaries paid to cards will still be received, but their withdrawal and use will be subject to new limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. There is a real possibility of cash shortages for purposes like pension issuance at post offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>, potentially worse than the 1990s when payments were overdue for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:23">[00:46:23]</a>.
*   **Foreign Currency Deposits:** Dollars in bank deposits will not be exempt from freezing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>. Automatic conversion to rubles at the Central Bank rate is not excluded, depending on the chosen freezing option and the severity of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>.
*   **Denomination:** Denomination of the ruble is not expected simultaneously with the freezing of deposits, but potentially several months or even a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. There is no immediate reason to exchange large denomination banknotes for smaller ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   **Loans and Mortgages:** Citizens will not have the right to withhold mortgage payments if deposits are frozen; banks will demand payment with greater force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. The real estate and banking systems are expected to face a "very serious crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>. The real estate market will experience stagnation, but authorities do not want a complete collapse and will allow bank transfers for housing purchases, albeit with potential restrictions for non-cash payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. The general socio-economic situation, not just deposit freezes, will negatively impact the real estate market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.
*   **Foreigners' Accounts:** Restrictions for foreigners are assumed not to interfere with business, but the actual outcome is uncertain as several models are being discussed, ranging from soft to extremely tough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.

#### Economic Adaptation to Sanctions
The Russian economy has demonstrated a capacity to adapt to sanctions, which were imposed gradually rather than immediately, giving the system time to adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The gradual nature of sanctions allowed the economy to acclimatize, much like a frog gradually adapting to warming water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. However, it is now reaching a point where the "frog begins to die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Impact of Potential Sanction Lifting

The lifting of sanctions, or at least the non-introduction of new ones, would have a positive effect on the [[Economic challenges in Russia | economic situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. The expectation of sanctions being lifted would also be positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>. If sanctions were lifted, the need to freeze deposits would naturally disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>.

However, a quick recovery is not expected. Even if a truce is reached by early next year, sanctions will not be lifted instantly. The process of lifting sanctions, currently under discussion, will take "months at least" and some aspects "in years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. It's compared to squeezing toothpaste from a tube, which is easy, but putting it back is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>.

### Broader Socio-Economic Outlook

While political changes, such as a change of power and the release of political prisoners, might bring a feeling of being able to "breathe more freely," tangible [[Social and economic challenges in Russia | socio-economic improvement]] will take time due to the "colossal inertia" of dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.

*   The first signs of improvement might be noticeable around the turn of the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.
*   To largely overcome the crisis, Russia will need at least two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

The overall period ahead is described as "the most turbulent and probably the most threatening times in the last 30 years of Russian history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.

On March 6, 2023, a raid by a group described as the "so-called Russian volunteer corps" occurred in the Bryansk region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The speaker expressed skepticism about the organization's existence, noting that no one knew of it before this event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Symbolic Nature of the Event

The purpose of the raid was described as "to show the flag" and "to demonstrate its own existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The information surrounding the raid was contradictory and mutually exclusive, leading to many versions of what happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Initially, some liberal-minded experts suggested it was a "cunningly conceived" operation by the [[general_svr_and_its_significance_in_russian_politics | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. However, this theory was dismissed; the event was characterized as "symbolic political" rather than primarily military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

The contradictory information even affected the highest levels of government, leading to the postponement of a Security Council meeting from Thursday to Friday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The political objective of this symbolic act was to demonstrate that the armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine could be transferred onto [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | Russian territory]] by [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russian volunteers]] fighting for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Public and Official Reactions

Despite the raid, it was deemed unlikely to gain public support in Russia, especially given reports of people being killed and civilians shelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. The Security Council was not frightened by the incident itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. What truly concerned them was the "presence of the very fact of [[russian_national_pride_and_identity | Russian nationalism]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Impact on Russian Nationalists

An expert, Dmitry Demushkin, suggested that the event would serve as a pretext to purge [[russian_nationalists_and_political_crisis | Russian nationalists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. While formal nationalist organizations don't exist in Russia, there's a subculture and informal groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This purge is anticipated not because nationalists would join Ukraine's side, but due to the expected [[russian_domestic_political_situation | political crisis]] after the armed conflict concludes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Security officers, anticipating this crisis, are beginning to target groups that could become a "tip of the spear" for [[russian_nationalists_and_political_crisis | Russian nationalists]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Vulnerability of Border Regions

The Bryansk region events highlighted the defenselessness of border populations against sabotage groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. However, the [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russian leadership]] appears unconcerned with protecting these territories, leaving it to local governors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. President Putin's primary concern is his own security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Broader Symbolic Threats

A mass drone attack on February 28, which Ukraine denied authorship of, saw at least five incidents in one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. One drone fell 100 km from Moscow, demonstrating that [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | Russian territory]] and protected objects are "touchable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This perception of vulnerability plays a significant role in decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Another trend is the escalation of rumors and fears around "mythical" private military companies (PMCs), likened to the "Blue Whale" phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. The amplification of these topics aims to create an image of a threat that [[political_address_and_military_mobilization_measures_in_russia | Russian law enforcement]] can valiantly fight against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This also serves to strengthen control over students and young people and exert pressure on parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

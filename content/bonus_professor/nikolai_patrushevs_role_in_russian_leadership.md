Since approximately October 26, the role of the de facto ruler of Russia is being performed by [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Nikolai Patrushev]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. He heads his own group and is in the process of forming a broad coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## The New Reality in Russia
The main topic concerning Russia's current reality is the alleged death of Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, which reportedly occurred on October 26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This is presented as an "irrefutable fundamental medical and anthropological fact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The body of the deceased president is said to be in a frozen state at his Valdai residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Temporary Replacement and Power Dynamics
The Russian president will be temporarily replaced by a physical double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This temporary period is expected to last a couple of months, not a year or a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

[[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Nikolai Patrushev]] is currently the actual ruler of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. The replacement of the former president by a double constitutes a state crime under Article 357 of the Criminal Code, specifically pertaining to conspiracy, purpose of capture or retention of power, and seizure or retention of power by unconstitutional means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. All individuals involved in forming this new government and redistributing portfolios, who are aware of these developments, are considered state criminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### Political Implications and Demonstrations of Strength
The new [[russian_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | political reality]] manifests in several ways:

*   **Internal Stability Threats**: Certain members of the coalition seeking preferences from Patrushev are demonstrating their strength, which includes actions like the events in Chechnya and Makhachkala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The granting of heavy weapons to Ramzan Kadyrov in Chechnya, along with the formation of new battalions (including one called Sheikh Mansur), serves as a demonstration of strength and a potential threat to stability in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. These actions, such as the riot in Makhachkala two days after Putin's death, are seen as groups joining the coalition under Patrushev's leadership showcasing their power and indicating boundaries not to be crossed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. The new government does not desire instability as it is still crystallizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

*   **Foreign Policy Shifts**: Russia has withdrawn from supporting the Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This shift resulted from behind-the-scenes negotiations with the current Russian leadership following a telephone call from Netanyahu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. The Israeli side sought to minimize Russia's assistance to the Palestinians and international terrorist networks, particularly while Israel conducts military operations in the Gaza Strip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This was achieved through a subtle hint, or blunt blackmail, concerning the revelation of the Russian president's health status and location when he was alive but unwell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

*   **Government Appointments**: Upcoming government appointments will reflect the new balance of power and the crystallization of a new government and configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. These events are expected to confirm the message that Putin is no longer alive, even for skeptics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

### Public Awareness and Participation
The information regarding Putin's death has spread widely across Russia and the world within two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The discussion of this topic, regardless of belief, contributes to the formation of a new psychological reality, where people consider that "something is still wrong here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. There has been an emergence of jokes and caricatures, such as referring to the "late president" as "the man from the refrigerator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. A notable observation is the absence of human sympathy for Putin in public comments or discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

There is a medical report on Putin's death, which is available and will be presented at the appropriate time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. It is asserted that many facts and confirmations, including human testimonies, will emerge to convince everyone that a fundamental reality has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

Citizens are encouraged to participate in shaping this new reality by reposting information, liking content, and providing material support, which is seen as helping to build their own future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

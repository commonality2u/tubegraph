To counter the Kremlin's goals, including the destruction of Ukraine's energy sector and attempts to bring the country to its knees, Ukraine can implement several strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Leveraging International Support
Ukraine should use the attacks on its energy sector to pressure Western countries that are providing aid. The goal is to encourage these allies to supply more modern, long-range weapons and extended-range missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This is seen as a way to enhance [[ukraines_military_strategy_and_international_support | Ukraine's military strategy and international support]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Military Actions
*   **Successful Offensive Operations:** A key counterstrategy is to carry out a successful offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This would contribute to the [[strategic_outcomes_of_the_ukrainian_offensive | strategic outcomes of the Ukrainian offensive]].
*   **Strikes on Russian Infrastructure:** Upon receiving sufficient long-range ammunition and missiles, Ukraine could strike at Russian infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
    *   Strikes are already being carried out on infrastructure in the border regions of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
    *   With more long-range capabilities, the affected area for these strikes could expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Preparing for Potential Escalation
Concerns exist regarding Moscow and other Russian cities preparing bomb shelters, suggesting a preparation for possible shelling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This is seen not just as preparation for nuclear war, but for the possibility that some cities in the European part of Russia could fall within the range of weapons provided to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. This highlights the potential for an escalation of the [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | international relations and military actions concerning Ukraine]].

### Response to Nuclear Threats
While the probability of the Kremlin using nuclear weapons is not zero, the speaker cannot predict if or when such an order would be given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. The West has indicated it would respond to the use of tactical nuclear weapons with conventional weapons, a plan that has been under consideration for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. While Europeans may not be fully ready for this escalation, the Americans and Britain are perceived as ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Despite [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin's strategy and plans regarding Ukraine]] that they will retreat, these countries are not expected to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

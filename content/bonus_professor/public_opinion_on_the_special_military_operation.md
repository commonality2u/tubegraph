Public opinion in Russia regarding the "special military operation" has been a topic of analysis, with data referencing closed surveys providing insights into varying perspectives among the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## Overall Sentiment
According to closed surveys, approximately one-third (slightly less than 30%) of Russians believe the special military operation should be stopped immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Demographics and Perspectives

### Age Groups
Support for immediate termination of the operation varies significantly by age group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>:
*   **Young people (18-24 years old)**: 56% are in favor of stopping the operation, while only 19% support its continuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This demographic includes potential conscripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Ages 25-34**: 43% favor continuing the operation, compared to 41% who want to stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   **Over 60 years old**: The majority (72%) insists on continuing the "denazification" of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This group is generally not threatened by mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

### Media Consumption
The primary source of information influences public opinion on the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>:
*   **Internet users**: Among those who primarily use the Internet for news, 47% are in favor of stopping the special operation, while 35% support continuing hostilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.
*   **TV viewers**: For those relying on television as their main source, the situation is "exactly the opposite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## Government Response to Public Opinion
The Russian government has introduced repressive measures to ensure apparent support for the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. This is seen as a way to "back up" support with "bayonets" or legislative amendments, as there is "no confidence in mass nationwide support" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

### Repressive Laws
Amendments to the criminal code, signed by the President, include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>:
*   **Public calls to action against Russia's security**: Up to 7 years in prison and a fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Repeated propaganda or public demonstration of Nazi symbols or extremist organizations**: Up to 4 years in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. This includes using logos of platforms like Facebook and Instagram, which are recognized as extremist organizations in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   **Confidential cooperation with foreign countries**: 2 to 8 years in prison with a fine of up to one million rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. This could apply to conversations with foreign friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[influence_of_media_and_public_perception_during_conflict | The Russian state]] intervenes to support television narratives, augmenting them with "the power of repressive policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

## Elite Opinions and Strategic Dilemmas
The hesitation of the President of the Russian Federation reflects the "not most successful move" of the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, as well as the mood within the ruling elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Two main viewpoints have emerged regarding the operation's successful ending or intermediate conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>:

1.  **Majority View (including military)**: Be content with current territorial acquisitions and begin negotiations with Ukraine for an agreement or truce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This "moderate majority" is persistent but not as influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
2.  **Radical Minority View**: Continue to a victorious end, aiming to take control of Kharkiv, Dnipro, the entire Black Sea coast (including Mykolaiv and Odesa regions), and even entering Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This "radical minority" is relatively influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

The first option (negotiating a peace treaty) is unacceptable to Ukraine and its active Western supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. The second option (fighting to the end) is deemed unlikely to be implemented from a military standpoint, based on the last five months of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Potential Future Developments
An increase in political turbulence is anticipated in August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. This is due to the likelihood of the armed confrontation entering a new phase and the potential for important decisions within politics related to the transit of supreme power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. The idea of mass mobilization, full or partial, remains a possibility, especially if Ukraine launches a successful counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.# Public Opinion on the Special Military Operation

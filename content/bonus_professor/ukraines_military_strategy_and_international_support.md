### Military Operations and Strategic Goals

In the past week, [[Ukrainian military tactics in Ukraine | Ukrainian troops]] successfully conducted a [[Ukraines potential offensive and its implications | counteroffensive]], pushing [[Russian military tactics in Ukraine | Russian forces]] away from Kharkiv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Fierce battles are ongoing on the Seversky Donets river, which are not expected to be successful for the Russian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

[[Ukraines potential offensive and its implications | Ukraine]] is aiming for a strategic turning point on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This goal is based on achieving technological military superiority, which is expected to result from the influx of international military assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Ukraine plans to mobilize a significant additional contingent and launch a [[Ukraines potential offensive and its implications | counteroffensive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This counteroffensive is anticipated to occur by the end of summer or early autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Ukraine's long-term objectives include restoring the territorial status quo to at least February 24 (the start of the full-scale invasion) and potentially regaining control of Donbass and even Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The prospect of Ukraine crossing the Russian border is considered a potential disaster for Russia, as it would effectively reset all of Russia's territorial gains, including potentially Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### International Support and Diplomatic Pressure

Ukraine's resolve to achieve a military advantage on the battlefield is strongly supported by the "Anglo-Saxon duo" â€“ Great Britain and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Poland, the Baltic countries, and some other European nations also provide significant support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

In contrast, some European leaders like former Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi (a personal friend of [[Putins strategy and plans regarding Ukraine | Putin]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, and implicitly French and German politicians, are advocating for Ukraine to accept Russia's conditions for negotiations, which would involve legalizing the current territorial status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This includes recognizing Crimea as Russian, Donbass as independent, and Russia's control over the Kherson region and parts of Zaporizhzhya, forming a land bridge to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

There are several reasons cited for these calls for peace:
*   **Russian Influence:** Russia maintains leverage and influence over some European politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Fear of Escalation:** European leaders fear an escalation of the conflict, which could lead to an increased refugee crisis. Approximately six million refugees are already outside Ukraine, placing a large financial and social burden on EU countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Global Famine Threat:** The ongoing conflict limits Ukraine's ability to export grain, raising concerns about a global famine due to disrupted logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Russian propaganda actively exploits this threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

The United States has reportedly pressured German Chancellor Scholz and French President Macron to adhere to Euro-Atlantic solidarity and the NATO-developed course of unconditional support for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This policy dictates waging war to a victorious end for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

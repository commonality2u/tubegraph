From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Valery Solovey addressed questions regarding the proposed lustration of the judicial system in Russia, outlining who would be affected and the rationale behind the policy. This plan is part of broader [[reforms_and_rehabilitation_in_russian_governance | reforms]] envisioned by a new political force in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Scope of Lustration

Initially, it was stated that "absolutely all employees of the judicial system" would be subject to lustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. However, this statement was clarified to avoid causing a complete collapse of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

The core principle remains the "lustration of the entire judicial corps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### Who Will Be Lustrated?

*   **All judges**: This includes judges of the Supreme and Constitutional Courts, with "no exceptions at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **High-level officials within the judicial system apparatus**: This would include, for example, heads of departments in the Supreme Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Who Will Not Be Lustrated?

*   **General apparatus employees**: Solovey explained that lustration of all apparatus employees, including court apparatuses, would lead to "chaos" and "emptiness" as "no one understands that this will not just be chaos, it will be emptiness, it will be nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Clerks and case manufacturers**: These individuals typically made no decisions and could not influence anything, regardless of their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Approach and Rationale

The approach to lustration will be "flexibly and realistically" applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The speaker acknowledged that the "ways and methods" of lustration can vary and change over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

The judicial system is seen as needing [[russian_legal_and_penal_system_reforms | humanization]], not further tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. The speaker also mentioned becoming an opponent of the death penalty, citing concerns about judicial errors if courts are not consistently "effective, professionally and honestly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

A special department or division within one of the existing departments may be created, named the "Department of Management or the Service for the Restoration of Constitutional Legality," to address issues like unjust property seizures and compensation for those who suffered under current laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

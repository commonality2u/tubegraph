The question of whether [[russian_political_regime_after_putin | Putinism]] can exist without Vladimir Putin is a key topic for discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Elite and Bureaucracy Perspective

It is considered common knowledge among Moscow officials and high-echelon bureaucracy that Putin will have to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. This sentiment extends to the middle layer of the federal bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. The understanding that "the boss is leaving" means that the system, regime, and mechanism built by Putin will change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This includes changes in disposition, the appearance of new bosses, and likely shifts in policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

### Consequences for the Administrative Apparatus

This uncertainty is leading to disorganization within the administrative apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Officials are questioning whether it is worth taking risky or even slightly risky steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. This situation is reminiscent of the period in 1990-1991 when Soviet offices began to function worse due to the uncertainty of the horizon, a misunderstanding of what lay ahead, and a feeling of growing risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

The approaching transitional moment and turning point mean that individuals within the system are increasingly focused on their personal and group objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. There is a sense that the time for a "last grab" has arrived, as they are unsure if they will retain their positions, influence, or access to budgetary resources after the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

## Impact on the System

According to the speaker, if Putin leaves, "almost everything" will change, though not immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. The [[russian_political_regime_after_putin | Putin system]] is understood to have Putin as its core; if this core disappears, the system will begin to fall apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This process is not expected to take decades or even years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

The State Council, currently being formed with personnel selected by Putin, is envisioned as a "terrarium of like-minded people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. While Putin could reconcile these individuals and maintain their loyalty and stability, it is doubted that they will remain united or friendly if the president weakens and attempts to govern from behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. The speaker expresses strong doubts that the system can be preserved without Putin, stating, "without Putin the [[russian_political_regime_after_putin | Putin system]] is impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

## Prospects for [[prospects_for_democracy_in_russia | Democracy]]

The speaker does not predict that life will automatically improve or that liberties and freedoms will necessarily follow Putin's departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. Achieving freedom and liberties will depend on the actions of the people themselves in the evolving situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. The current political climate makes it difficult to predict future political developments, including whether scheduled elections will take place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

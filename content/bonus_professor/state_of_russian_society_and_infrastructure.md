Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, in episode 42 of "What's Happening" recorded on December 8th, comments on the Russian president's speech to the council on human rights and civil society development [00:00:26]. Solovyov states that the speech offers insight into the president's "mental state and mental style," which helps understand his motivation, words, and actions [00:01:33]. A significant distance exists between the president's words and actions, a distance that is constantly increasing [00:01:50].

## Pre-approved Discourse
The Human Rights Council is described as a "specially selected body" from which "troublemakers" were removed in November [00:01:57]. The list of questions posed to the president was pre-formed, approved by the administration, and personally approved by the president, ensuring no "uncomfortable and disturbing" topics were raised [00:02:13].

## Current Conditions and Challenges
Solovyov summarizes the president's speech with the phrase, "What do you want from a sick mind?" [00:03:07]. This "sick person" is not a metaphor, but a literal description [00:03:14].

### Human Rights and State Sovereignty
The international doctrine of human rights, which includes free elections, separation of powers, freedom of movement, and inviolability of personal property, is claimed by the president to be used to destroy state sovereignty [00:03:22]. Solovyov argues that these freedoms threaten only a state founded on "the power of criminals, thieves, and bandits," as human rights challenge such foundations [00:03:52].

Regarding the rights of Donbass residents, which the president claims are violated, Solovyov points out a logical inconsistency: if human rights undermine sovereignty, why should the rights of Donbass residents undermine Ukraine's sovereignty? [00:08:18]. He attributes this inconsistency to a "certain type of thinking" characteristic of the president and others with "medical indications" [00:08:40].

### The Reality of Russia's National Interests
Solovyov questions what Russia is defending, contrasting it with Finland's historical efforts to create conditions "worth defending" [00:05:04]. He highlights severe infrastructure and [[social_and_economic_challenges_in_russia | social and economic challenges]] within Russia:
*   Approximately 25% of Russian toilets are located outdoors [00:05:28].
*   The country is described as an "emptying and dying territory" with a thinning population, a process accelerated by the special military operation [00:05:33]. [[economic_and_social_consequences_in_russia | Economic and social consequences in Russia]].
*   Pensioners receive "tiny pensions," making a decent lifestyle "impossible" [00:05:48]. [[social_and_economic_challenges_faced_by_russian_society | Social and economic challenges]].
*   Donbass, which Russia claims to be "thriving," has seen at least 1.5 million, possibly 2 million, people leave since 2014 [00:06:27].

### Military Operation and its Cost
Solovyov challenges the president's narrative that the war was started by Ukraine in 2014, citing Igor Strelkov-Girkin's claim that he started the war in Donbass [00:09:00].

He critiques the president's statement that Russia is the "only guarantor of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine," noting that Russia is annexing Ukrainian territories [00:11:32]. The special military operation, despite its purpose of guaranteeing sovereignty, has led to former Ukrainian territories being "included in Russia," likely not for long [00:11:37].

Concerns about the well-being of mobilized citizens are raised, specifically the lack of equipment and the slow response to the need for rehabilitation for wounded military personnel and civilians [00:12:22]. Nine months into the operation, discussions about establishing modern prosthetics, providing drugs, and creating a rehabilitation system are only just beginning [00:13:31]. This reflects the "promptness of the response of the Russian authorities" to the needs of its military and citizens [00:14:03].

The special military operation absorbs a quarter of Russia's budget, meaning funds for "new hospitals, pension increases, social payments, increases in maternity capital" are diverted to "guns, shells, artillery shots" [00:19:33].

### Financial Mismanagement and State of the Economy
There's a critical mention of significant financial discrepancies: 300 billion in Russian reserves frozen in Europe, but it turned out "there are no 200 billion at all," implying they were "stolen" [00:20:22]. This suggests a widespread issue where the "bins of the Motherland" are empty [00:20:37]. [[state_of_the_russian_economy | State of the Russian Economy]].

### Infrastructure and Living Standards
Solovyov emphasizes that Russia, despite being the largest country by area, is one of the most "unkempt" [00:20:53]. He highlights the need to address basic issues like gasification for millions of people, providing water, and building proper toilets [00:21:25]. He questions the acquisition of "someone else's land" when Russia has so many internal problems [00:21:47].

### Healthcare and Future Mobilization
While the president promised additional payments for primary care doctors starting January, Solovyov notes that a "second stage" of mobilization is expected to include 300,000 women, primarily doctors and medical personnel [00:22:31]. This will lead to those remaining working "for two for three," making the promised increase "insignificant" compared to their increased workload [00:22:55].

## The President's Mindset
Solovyov contends that the president genuinely believes his own statements, despite their illogical nature and inconsistencies [00:23:31]. He reiterates that this "type of thinking" is "classified as medicine" [00:23:53], suggesting a "sick consciousness" is at the helm of Russia [00:24:03]. This situation is seen as a "grief and misfortune" not only for Russia but also for its neighbors [00:24:23].

## Conclusion
Solovyov maintains that "victory will be ours" for his audience [00:28:29]. He implies that his analysis and predictions of [[public_opinion_and_sociology_in_russia | events in Russia]] serve as a guide for understanding the current [[russian_internal_politics_and_economy | political and economic situation]] and future prospects [00:24:52].

This article discusses the potential for a [[prospects_of_political_crisis_and_potential_changes_in_russian_governance | political crisis]] in Russia, including the likelihood of [[social_unrest_and_potential_for_protest_in_russia | unrest]] or a full-scale revolution, and their potential ramifications, drawing on expert analysis.

## Inevitability of a Political Crisis
A [[prospects_of_political_crisis_and_potential_changes_in_russian_governance | political crisis]] in Russia is considered inevitable in the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. While the exact form and consequences of this crisis are open to discussion, depending on its dynamics and public participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, predicting a revolution with certainty is not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The most probable outcome of this crisis is anticipated to be [[social_unrest_and_potential_for_protest_in_russia | unrest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### The Concept of Turmoil
The term "turmoil" is described as a collection of various conflicts differing in nature and intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. It can be seen as a substitute for revolution or a combination of revolution and civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This "turmoil" is considered a more likely development of the [[prospects_of_political_crisis_and_potential_changes_in_russian_governance | political crisis]] in the Russian Federation, which is deemed inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

## Security Forces and Potential Dissent
In the event of widespread [[social_unrest_and_potential_for_protest_in_russia | unrest]], an order to open fire to kill by security forces is expected to be given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. However, there is a high probability that this order will be blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. It is suggested that security forces will not defect to the side of the protesters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. In the best-case scenario for the people, they are expected to remain neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. There might be a few "brave romantics" or "renegades" who choose to join the protesters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Potential Restrictions on Movement
The database of individuals prohibited from crossing Russian borders currently includes 8 million people due to debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. These individuals are expected to be among the first to receive summonses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. This database is anticipated to expand to include conscripts of various categories (A, B, and V), potentially reaching 7-8 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. In total, the number of people prohibited from leaving the Russian Federation could increase to 15, or even up to 20 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, representing approximately every seventh citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. As of January 10, an additional 4 million Russians reportedly faced a border crossing ban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

A student card and academic deferment currently serve as a basis for exemption from [[possibility_of_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. However, there is no guarantee that students will not be added to the database of those prohibited from leaving the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Introduction of Martial Law and General Mobilization
The introduction of [[possibility_of_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] is expected to coincide with an open [[possibility_of_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Initially, this may be termed an "additional modulation set" rather than an open mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Around the anniversary of the special military operation's start, a concept of "people's war" or "total war" is expected to be announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, leading to the official declaration of general [[possibility_of_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] and [[possibility_of_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. While students are likely to remain exempt from direct [[possibility_of_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]], a ban on leaving the Russian Federation is a significant possibility for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Economic Outlook
The likelihood of an [[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_russia | economic crisis]] in Russia is assessed as quite high, with political reasons being a primary driver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. While a complete "collapse" where the economy ceases to function is not expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>, significant problems are anticipated, including:
*   Mass impoverishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>
*   Logistics disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>
*   Volatility in the national currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>
*   High inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>

Despite these challenges, it is believed that the population has endured similar difficulties before and will survive again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

## Outlook for Political Change
The year 2023 is seen as having every chance to be the year when Russia can decisively [[possibility_of_political_change_in_russia | change its own fate]], the fate of its people, and the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>. The speaker expresses conviction that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.

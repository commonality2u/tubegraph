On April 14th, 2021, a stream was held with SVR General Viktor Mikhalych discussing [[discussion_on_russian__ukrainian_relations_and_conflict_resolution | Russian-Ukrainian relations]] and the prospect of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Military Build-up and Escalation Scenarios
The concentration of troops, "rattling of weapons," and preparation of scenarios along the border is not a bluff but "unambiguous preparation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. As of the discussion, the concentration of Russian troops, equipment, and aircraft continues, with no changes to existing plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. While the troop deployment is a form of coercion, it does not definitively mean the scenario will lead to military action, but it is preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

The Russian leadership is currently considering U.S. President Biden's proposals within the context of preparing for further escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. No clear decisions have been made, and Russia is demanding specifics from the U.S. regarding timelines and agreement details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Reasons for Potential Escalation
Several factors are cited as reasons for the current military preparations:
*   **Crimean Water Supply** The worsening water situation in Crimea annually threatens the tourist season and could lead to a humanitarian catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Resolving the water supply to Crimea is considered a primary reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Domestic Political Successes** A lack of successes on the domestic political front creates a need for external political achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Putin's Approach** President Putin is known for solving multiple issues simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Potential Military Goals
If military actions were to begin, beyond securing water access for Crimea, other goals could include:
*   **"Assistance to Donbass Residents"**: The official narrative would likely be to assist residents of Donbass (DPR/LPR) against a potential Ukrainian attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. However, this alone would not explain the large number of amassed troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Exploiting Ukrainian Weakness**: Russian military preparations acknowledge that Ukrainian President Zelensky is considered militarily inexperienced and incapable of planning military operations, which could be exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Provocations as a Pretext**:
    *   **"Terrorist Attack" in Crimea**: Nikolai Patrushev's statements about Ukraine preparing a terrorist attack in Crimea could serve as a pretext <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Such provocations, if they occur, would be orchestrated by internal Russian forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
    *   **Odessa Provocation**: A project involving pro-Russian forces is being prepared for May 1-2 in Odessa, possibly involving armed individuals, to create a pretext for "saving Odessa residents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
    *   **Death of "Russian Patriots"**: Plans exist for the death of Russian "combat writers" or figures who fought in Donbass, to be attributed to the Ukrainian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

### Prospects of an Invasion
A breakthrough by Russian forces in Ukraine is considered "quite possible," with a 90% chance of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. However, this would likely lead to desperate resistance and a protracted partisan war or civil conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:17">[01:07:17]</a>. Putin does not have plans to conquer all of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>. Military actions would be accompanied by partial mobilization and the declaration of martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>.

## International Relations and Potential Consequences
*   **Biden-Putin Call**: The recent call between Biden and Putin did not result in a "win" for Putin; he gained only temporary moral satisfaction and propaganda value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The U.S. is not prepared to fight for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. A [[russia_and_ukraine_conflict_dynamics | conflict with Ukraine]] is not beneficial to the U.S. or the European Union financially or in terms of image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Biden's proposal for a meeting is seen as a "very good move," offering talks while simultaneously maintaining leverage for potential sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Sanctions**: Putin and his inner circle are not afraid of sanctions; they do not personally concern him or affect their mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>. The belief that Putin would not start a war due to lack of funds is dismissed, as "all the money in the country is his money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>.
*   **Drug Trafficking as a Lever**: The Security Council of Russia, under Patrushev's supervision and Putin's leadership, controls a significant portion of drug trafficking to Europe, estimated at 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:04">[00:35:04]</a>. This is a serious lever of pressure on Europe; sudden cessation or flooding of the market can severely impact political situations, crime rates, and public health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>. This represents an element of hybrid warfare that can be activated as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.
*   **Nagorno-Karabakh Hostages**: Russian military personnel in Nagorno-Karabakh are effectively hostages to Turkey and Azerbaijan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>. A war in Donbass would undoubtedly impact their situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.
*   **Western Policy**: Western governments, including the U.S. and [[uk_and_russian_relations | UK]], are aware of Putin's health condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. Biden's recent actions indicate an attempt to "delay time" and "win time," suggesting a strategy to wait for a "natural end" to Putin's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>. Putin, conversely, is in a hurry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics and Outlook
*   **Putin's Health**: Putin's health is not very good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. His "life horizon" is predicted by doctors to be "quite close" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. His extreme isolation and fear of going out are seen as indicators of serious illness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. He has experienced episodes of "raving" and "inadequate" behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. He has recently undergone another serious medical examination, confirming that "not everything is in order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.
*   **Impact of Health on Political Decisions**: Putin's deteriorating health means he will "have to choose someone" to take his place soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>.
*   **Parliamentary Elections**: The Kremlin fears unrest associated with the upcoming parliamentary elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>. A military conflict is considered as a possible way to indefinitely postpone elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>.
*   **Fear of Uprising**: Putin is not afraid of conspiracies among his inner circle, who are considered loyal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. However, he was "very afraid" during the January protests and left Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>. He only understands the "power of force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.
*   **War and System Collapse**: A war would be the "guaranteed collapse of the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>. Paradoxically, the beginning of military actions could be beneficial to the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>.
*   **Lukashenko and Belarus**: Lukashenko is under serious pressure from Russia regarding troop deployment to borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>. He is seen as more cunning than the Russian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. The Belarusian revolution, in a paradoxical way, helped Lukashenko stay in power, as it prevented Putin from absorbing Belarus directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. Putin's focus is currently on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>.

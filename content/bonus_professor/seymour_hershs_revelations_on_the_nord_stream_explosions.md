## Background and Allegations
In February 2023, journalist Seymour Hersh, a Pulitzer Prize winner from 1970, released an "exposure" detailing who was allegedly behind the explosion of the Nord Stream pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. This topic was highlighted as a key point for discussion due to its implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Assessment of the Revelations
According to commentary on February 19, 2023, the information presented by Hersh regarding the Nord Stream explosions has "absolutely no relation" to reality, not even "one hundredth of a percent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

The speaker questioned the true origin of the information Hersh utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. It was noted that there is a "certain trace" to the information, but this trace is explicitly *not* Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. When Hersh's "alleged investigation" was published, Russian propaganda was "completely bewildered" because it was a surprise to them, indicating the source was "another non-Russian" entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

It was suggested that Hersh was "played blind" by others, potentially taking advantage of his "dementia state and the tendency to conspiracy theories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. The speaker categorized this as an instance where a "once honored bison-American journalism" figure was manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

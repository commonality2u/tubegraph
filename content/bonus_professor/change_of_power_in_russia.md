The prospect of [[change_in_the_political_landscape_in_russia | change in the political landscape in Russia]] and the departure of the current leadership is a recurring topic of discussion. While immediate [[future_political_changes_in_Russia | political changes]] are considered unlikely in the short term, long-term shifts are anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Predictions for Political Transition

The chances of a change of power occurring this year are described as "small" and "tiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. However, it is suggested that certain events, even if "not very noticeable or even invisible to the general public," could take place in December and potentially stimulate a change of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. A more probable timeframe for a change of power is "next year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Regarding specific predictions about Vladimir Putin's departure from Russian politics in 2022, the speaker affirms these predictions have not been abandoned, but the likelihood of them happening is decreasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The "horizon" and "term of his legal capacity" are said to be "extremely limited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, a fact known by Putin himself and his entourage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. His entourage may "speed up this process," especially as military action escalates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Forecasts by Andrey Valerievich Kosmos concerning Putin's departure are noted to align with other independent sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Driving Forces of Change

The primary driving force behind a "Russian coup" is expected to be the "elites," rather than the opposition or Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. This process is anticipated to initially develop as an "elite conflict," with factions potentially seeking support from society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Consequences of Power Change

A change of power is expected to lead to a period where conditions in Russia "will get worse," though this period is projected to be "not for long," possibly "a few months" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

Despite this, there is an optimistic outlook that Russia "will be a free, truly democratic side" within the current lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. However, achieving a truly democratic state with functioning institutions and procedures is estimated to take "at least 10 to 15 years and maybe more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Approaching Turmoil and National Revival

A period of "turmoil" is described as "inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. However, this will not result in "the collapse and death of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Russia is expected to undergo "very serious upheavals," potentially a crisis "more dangerous, acute than the crisis of 1993," but the country and society are predicted to "cope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

### External Threats Post-Change

Following a [[new_power_configuration_in_russia | new power configuration in Russia]], external threats are predicted not to disappear entirely but to be "significantly minimized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Specifically, there will be "no external threats in the western direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The main challenge and danger are identified as being "in the east" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

### Belarus and Russia

The future of Belarus, particularly its potential relationship with Russia, is said to depend "exclusively on the dynamics of the political situation in Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. When the crisis begins in Russia, it is deemed "absolutely certain" that Lukashenko will have to "suddenly leave his post" and "Belarus will distance itself from Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

### Medvedev as a Successor

Dmitry Medvedev is not considered a viable candidate for Putin's successor because he is perceived by all, including Putin, as a "clown" and is not trusted by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

### End of the Tunnel

Despite the "gloomy prospects" presented for the near future, there is an assertion that "at the end of this tunnel the light awaits us, the sun of a new Russia awaits us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This future is seen as achievable, with the conviction that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.

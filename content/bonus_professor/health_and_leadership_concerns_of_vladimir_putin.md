Discussions surrounding the [[health_and_public_appearances_of_vladimir_putin | health and public appearances of Vladimir Putin]] and his leadership style frequently arise, particularly concerning their impact on domestic and foreign policy decisions.

## Putin's Health and Public Appearances

Sources suggest that President Biden and U.S. intelligence agencies are "perfectly well" aware of the state of [[health_and_public_appearances_of_president_putin | President Putin's health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. There is an assertion that a direct, in-person meeting with Putin within the next six months to a year might be theoretically impossible due to his condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The question is raised as to why Putin has been "sitting in a bunker for a year," "afraid to go out," and limiting access to himself, suggesting underlying health issues beyond fears of coronavirus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

It is stated that Putin "really does not feel very well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. While no specific date for his death is given, "doctors predict a life horizon" that is described as "quite close" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. Despite this, he is not portrayed as requiring stretchers or constant revival before public appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

More recently, Putin reportedly underwent "a serious medical examination with the involvement of specialists," revealing that "not everything is in order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. His health condition is believed to be "getting worse," which will "willy-nilly" force him to choose a successor "soon enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.

Unusual behaviors attributed to Putin, which have been confirmed, include "extremely inadequate" behavior, "raving" for 15-20 minutes, and starting to "rave about him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:52:52]</a>. These episodes are infrequent but do occur and may be a consequence of "very potent drugs with unpredictable consequences for the cognitive sphere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.

## Unconventional Beliefs and Practices

Putin reportedly engages in unconventional practices, such as consulting shamans. This behavior, seen as "complete nonsense" by some, is considered "quite normal" from his and his inner circle's perspective, akin to visiting a church for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:50">[00:45:50]</a>.

It is stated that Putin's oncology, which "came back to him," connects to his belief in "magicians" for healing in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:20">[00:45:20]</a>. Furthermore, it is claimed that "for a month now, the president of Russia, Vladimir Putin, is against Thorin's therapy," which is described as "drinking urine," a shocking but "absolutely serious" claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:23">[00:46:23]</a>.

There is also a rumor within "shamanic" or "occult" circles that Putin's participation in a ritual involving "sipping sacrificial blood of black dogs" has tied him to Shoigu, implying that Shoigu can exert "excessive influence on him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:28">[00:49:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>.

The resignation of the former head of Tuva was reportedly linked to a "leak of information" about Putin and Shoigu's visit to the republic and a "shamanic ritual" performed by the former head's brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:48">[00:47:48]</a>.

## Putin's Leadership and Control

Putin is characterized as an "autocrat" where "everything depends on his opinion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. He reportedly believes that "everything that is in Russia is all his" and that citizens' lives and freedoms are "on rent" from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:37">[00:42:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. This extends to the judicial system and law enforcement agencies, which are described as "his guards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.

### Decision-Making and Strategy
Putin is described as a leader who "solves several issues at once in one fell swoop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This includes military preparations, which are seen as a form of "coercion" to achieve political goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

It is asserted that Putin "understands only the power of only forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. He demonstrates strength externally and domestically, and when faced with weakness, he "understands that it is possible to press, press endlessly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.

### Internal [[russian_internal_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Political Dynamics and Leadership Issues]]
The Russian leadership, including Putin, is currently considering Biden's proposals while continuing preparations for escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. They are demanding specifics from American leadership regarding "deadlines" and "what exactly we will agree on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

Putin is reportedly "afraid of mass protests" and "unrest associated with the elections" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. However, he is not afraid of a "conspiracy as such" from his inner circle, as they are "devoted to him" and "have a colossal influence on him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. This group, including Yuri Kovalchuk, the Rotenbergs, and Timchenko, is seen as unlikely to stage a "palace coup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>.

### Succession and the System's Future
The idea that the system would "fall apart" if Putin dies is dismissed as "complete nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. It's argued that "another person will come who is deep" and the system will remain the same unless it is actively destroyed, along with those who created it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. A younger, healthier leader might even strengthen the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

If military actions were to begin, "the soul" of the current leadership would "definitely come out on top" without prospects for other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. In the event of a military conflict, the "system is guaranteed" to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:34">[01:04:34]</a>.

### External Perceptions and Strategies
Foreign governments, including the U.S., UK, and several European countries, are aware of Putin's [[putins_control_and_health_speculations | health and political future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. Biden's recent moves are interpreted as an attempt to "delay time" and "win time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>. Conversely, Putin is perceived as being "in a hurry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>.

Regarding sanctions, it is stated that Putin is "not afraid" of them personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a>. The argument that he "does not have a day for it" to start a war due to financial concerns is dismissed as "stupid opinion," as "all the money in the country is his money" and "all the reserves" are at his disposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>. Sanctions are said not to affect the mood of the military-politically inclined circle around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.

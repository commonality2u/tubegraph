## The Shrinking Media Landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

As of March 4th, 2022, an "information iron curtain" is descending in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Alternative media outlets have "practically ceased to exist," with bloggers being a notable exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Many media organizations, such as the "Ural building sign" and "Silver Rain," have been forced to close or stop producing politically or socially significant news due to the impossibility of speaking freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This situation is painfully reminiscent of the Soviet Union, which had limited television channels and newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Threats to Remaining Platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>

YouTube, a highly popular video hosting platform in Russia, is under threat of closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. While many users are not politically interested and primarily use YouTube for entertainment or practical content, and a considerable number rely on it for income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, its monetization for content creators in the Russian Federation has been sharply reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The authorities might be delaying YouTube's closure due to its large, non-politicized audience, fearing their potential politicization if the platform is shut down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Legal and Societal Challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>

A new law adopted on Friday (March 4th, 2022) by the State Duma makes it unclear how to discuss events in Ukraine, as any phrase could be regarded as propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Amendments to the administrative code are also being prepared, potentially prohibiting terms like "anti-war movement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

> "Therefore we will live with you will use some cubism my like a peace movement or a peace-loving part of the public that you are now hearing from me please remember" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>

Censorship has effectively been introduced, functioning as a de facto element of martial law without formal legal justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

## The Role of Information and Public Opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>

The Kremlin relies on sociological data from pro-government agencies like FLOM and VTsIOM, which claim high levels of support (70%) for the Kremlin's operation in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. However, the speaker expresses doubt about the accuracy of these figures, believing the situation is "far from being so rosy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This highlights the [[media_manipulation_and_lies_in_russian_politics | challenges of Russian society and propaganda]] and the [[the_influence_of_media_and_public_opinion_in_russian_politics | influence of media and public opinion in Russian politics]].

Propaganda employs tactics such as the "spiral of silence" to manage public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Despite these efforts, "life is better than any explanations" and can change even the most "stubborn, deluded and stubborn" individuals, as life is not propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. This emphasizes the organic nature of [[public perception and potential triggers for sociopolitical change in Russia | public perception and potential triggers for sociopolitical change in Russia]] and [[public opinion and political shifts in Russia | public opinion and political shifts in Russia]].

## Importance of Independent Voices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>

In this environment, it is crucial to support those who "convey to society not a loud but clear voice of common sense, human dignity and moral sobriety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. The speaker urges individuals to strengthen "horizontal connections" and help each other, stating that "you can't get out of hell alone and modern Russia is of course glad and there is more and more opportunity to be convinced because yes you can only get out together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. This highlights the importance of fostering an [[impact_of_media_on_russian_society | impact of media on Russian society]] that promotes common sense and moral clarity.

The financial viability of independent content creators is severely impacted, with earning money from advertising on platforms like YouTube becoming impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. Despite this, the speaker continues to share information, believing that while the present is difficult, and the future promises "even harder times," victory will ultimately be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. This underlines the ongoing struggle for the [[future of Russian media and freedom of speech | future of Russian media and freedom of speech]].

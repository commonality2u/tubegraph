Patriotism, from the speaker's perspective, is defined as a deep affection for one's country and its people, not the deification of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. This contrasts with what is often portrayed in Russia as state deification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Defining Patriotism
True patriotism, according to the speaker, involves:
*   Love for one's native land and nation, regardless of how the nation is named <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   The aspiration to enhance life, making it freer, wealthier, and more peaceful, while ensuring protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

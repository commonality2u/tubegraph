The Kremlin's foreign policy and decision-making are characterized by a struggle between various internal viewpoints, a reliance on aggressive tactics like blackmail, and an attempt to prepare for prolonged confrontation. These dynamics shape its approach to the ongoing "special military operation" (SMO) and its relations with the West.

## Military Strategy and Internal Divisions

The past week did not see significant events but rather "the expectation of the next meeting of the State Duma" on July 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:49">[01:21:49]</a>. This meeting, which was expected to announce "cardinal" measures such as martial law in border regions with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:15">[02:17:15]</a>, ultimately yielded little beyond the appointment of Denis Manturov as vice-premier for import substitution and the adoption of several laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:16">[01:46:16]</a>. The Russian President "did not dare to give a move precisely to the cardinal option" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:44">[02:28:44]</a>, reflecting current hesitations that stem from the "not most successful move of the special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:05">[03:07:05]</a>. The "trouble is that this plan was never made public and is unknown to anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:54">[03:17:54]</a>.

The president's hesitations are also influenced by the "mood of the ruling elites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:46">[03:35:46]</a>, where two main viewpoints have crystallized regarding the SMO's conclusion:
*   **Majority View**: Including the military, this group believes Russia "must be content with the status quo, that is, the achieved territorial acquisitions," and then begin negotiating with Ukraine for an agreement or truce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:07">[03:53:07]</a>. This option is considered "unacceptable for Ukraine and... that part of the West that actively supports Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:10">[05:28:10]</a>.
*   **Radical Minority View**: This group argues for going "to the end to a victorious end," which involves taking control of Kharkiv, Dnipro (formerly Dnepropetrovsk), the entire Black Sea coast (including Mykolaiv and Odesa regions), and even entering and taking control of Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:35">[04:25:35]</a>. This radical option is seen as "unlikely to be implemented from a military point of view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:40">[05:41:40]</a>, given the events of the past five months on the Ukrainian front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:05">[05:52:05]</a>.

The Kremlin finds itself in a difficult position, caught between options that are either unacceptable to external parties or militarily unfeasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:09">[05:59:09]</a>.

## Diplomatic and Coercive Strategies

To navigate this situation, the Kremlin is attempting to "put pressure on Europe so that Europe puts pressure on Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:51">[06:11:51]</a> to agree to Russian terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:30">[06:26:30]</a>. This pressure manifests in two primary forms:

*   **Economic Blackmail**: Described as "gas blackmail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:10">[06:34:10]</a>, this strategy aims to exacerbate "economic problems" in Europe, leading to "domestic political crises" in various European countries, such as the crisis seen in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:24">[06:40:24]</a>.
*   **Forceful Blackmail**: This involves hinting at military possibilities that "have not yet been used" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:37">[08:37:37]</a>. An operational meeting of the Security Council on July 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:25">[07:34:25]</a>, which had a closed part, resulted in "leaks directed just at the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:07">[08:07:07]</a>. These leaks allegedly discussed "extremely unpleasant and simply unpleasant for sensitive and dangerous measures of influence on Europe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:20">[08:22:20]</a>. The intention is for Europe to "increase pressure on Kyiv so that Kyiv would measure came down to reconciliation with Russia on Russian conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:25">[08:41:25]</a>. These leaks also serve to "warn Ukraine against a counteroffensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:02">[09:31:02]</a>, particularly given the "real" threat of losing the Kherson region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:07">[10:05:07]</a>.

## Long-Term Vision: Technological Sovereignty and Isolation

While engaging in blackmail, the Kremlin is also "preparing for a long confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:15">[10:17:15]</a>, embracing the idea of a "besieged fortress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:04">[10:22:04]</a>. This is reflected in Denis Manturov's statement about needing to move "from a market economy strategy... to a strategy of technological sovereignty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:15">[10:38:15]</a>. This "poetics of isolationism" aims to create "one's own base for the production of high-tech products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:19">[10:54:19]</a>. However, the speaker notes that the only countries to have achieved "technological sovereignty" in the modern interdependent world are [[north_korea_and_iran | North Korea]] and [[north_korea_and_iran | Iran]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:05">[11:11:05]</a>, with [[north_korea_and_iran | North Korea's]] technological development compared to the USSR of the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:09">[11:23:09]</a>. This ideal is considered "unattainable" for Russia due to "extremely serious limitations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:07">[11:42:07]</a>.

Past efforts at "import substitution" under Manturov have shown significant collapses in industrial output in May 2022, including:
*   Car production: 97% collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:42">[12:11:42]</a>
*   Passenger buses: 77% collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:48">[12:14:48]</a>
*   Diesel locomotives: 63% collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:51">[12:17:51]</a>
*   Washing machines: 59% collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:40">[12:21:40]</a>
*   Refrigerators: 58% collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:50">[12:24:50]</a>
*   Freight cars: 52% collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:28">[12:25:28]</a>
*   Passenger cars: 40% collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:43">[12:29:43]</a>

It is anticipated that "with technological sovereignty it will be approximately the same as with import substitution: money will be spent immeasurably but they will... collapse into the abyss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:02">[12:34:02]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Repressive Measures

Despite official narratives, closed surveys suggest a significant portion of Russian society desires an end to the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:21">[13:01:21]</a>:
*   Less than 30% of Russians believe the SMO "must be stopped immediately" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:07">[13:09:07]</a>.
*   Among 18-24 year olds, 56% are in favor of stopping, while only 19% support continuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:09">[13:38:09]</a>.
*   Among 25-34 year olds, 43% favor continuation, and 41% oppose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:27">[13:46:27]</a>.
*   The majority (72%) insisting on continuing the "denazification of Ukraine" are respondents over 60 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:06">[13:56:06]</a>.
*   Internet users, for whom the internet is the main source of information, largely favor stopping the operation (47% for stopping, 35% for continuing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:09">[14:28:09]</a>. In contrast, TV viewers show the opposite trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:08">[14:43:08]</a>.

Recognizing this lack of "mass nationwide support" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:03">[17:24:03]</a>, the Kremlin is using "repressive policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:11">[15:07:11]</a>. Recent amendments to the criminal code, signed by the President, include:
*   "Public calls to action against the security of Russia": up to 7 years in prison and a fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:10">[15:35:10]</a>.
*   "Repeated propaganda or public demonstration of Nazi symbols, an extremist organization": up to 4 years in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:07">[15:42:07]</a>. This specifically applies to displaying logos of organizations recognized as extremist in Russia, such as Facebook and Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:03">[16:03:03]</a>.
*   "Confidential cooperation with foreign countries": from 2 to 8 years in prison with a fine of up to a million rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:17">[16:30:17]</a>.

These amendments are seen as a way to back up "apparent support... with bayonets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:52">[17:30:52]</a>, or in this case, "legislative amendments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:08">[17:43:08]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The speaker anticipates an "increase in turbulence in August" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:19">[18:36:19]</a> for two reasons:
1.  The "armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine will enter a new phase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:04">[18:47:04]</a>.
2.  "Important decisions may be made within politics related to the transit of supreme power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:19">[19:04:19]</a>, potentially including the appearance of "a new prime minister" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:00">[19:13:00]</a>.

The possibility of mass mobilization, either full or partial, remains open, especially if Ukraine launches a successful counteroffensive in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:13">[18:11:13]</a>. These escalating risks mean that engaging in "political commentary" is becoming "increasingly dangerous to speak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>, with "risks sharply increasing for anyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:11">[20:02:11]</a> making "independent commentary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:12">[21:09:12]</a>.

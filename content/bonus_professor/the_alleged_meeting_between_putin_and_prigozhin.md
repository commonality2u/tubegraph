On July 10th, 2023, Russian Presidential Secretary Peskov made a statement claiming that a meeting took place on June 29th between [[yevgeny_prigozhins_return_to_russia | Yevgeny Prigozhin]], commanders of the [[the_role_of_prigozhin_and_wagner_postputin | Wagner private military company]], and President Putin in the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Peskov stated this meeting lasted three hours, occurred in a "good positive atmosphere," and "ended on a positive note" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Dispelling the Claim

The speaker strongly refutes Peskov's statement, calling it "elementary brazen lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. According to the speaker, no meeting with [[yevgeny_prigozhins_return_to_russia | Prigozhin]] or the [[the_role_of_prigozhin_and_wagner_postputin | Wagner private military company]] occurred on June 29th or at any time thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The maximum possible interaction, which is still doubted by "more substantial" sources, would have been a telephone conversation between Putin and [[yevgeny_prigozhins_return_to_russia | Prigozhin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. A personal meeting is "absolutely excluded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Reasons for the Fabricated Meeting

The alleged meeting was fabricated by the Russian leadership, including [[role_of_peskov_and_russian_elite_in_spreading_misinformation | Peskov]], for several key reasons:

### 1. To Bolster Putin's Reputation
The primary reason is to show that Putin "is afloat" and is a "wise Leader" in complete control of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This is intended to support the Russian president's reputation, which "suffered catastrophically" after the Wagner mutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The narrative implies that the mutiny was part of "Putin's multi-move" or a "cleverly conceived game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### 2. To Assert Putin's Control and Health
The lie aims to demonstrate that Putin is "in control of the situation," "capable," and "healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This is part of a broader campaign of "pure hoaxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, such as the alleged president's appearance in Derbent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. The speaker asserts that the real president "physically cannot meet with anyone and appear anywhere" and is "constantly replaced by a double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

*   **Evidence of Doubles**:
    *   The speaker claims there are two main doubles used, one of whom is "very close to the president" for speaking engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   The existence of a double is widely accepted within the Russian elite and by "self-respecting intelligence service[s] of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
    *   An examination conducted in a G7 country, involving phonoscopic (voice) and anthropological analysis by multiple independent experts, concluded that "three different people" are seen under the general name of the President of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
    *   The speaker notes that conversations about doubles are occurring "at the highest level" and contribute to the "delegitimization of the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Putin's Physical Condition**:
    *   The speaker claims Putin is in a "worse physical condition" and is "actually blind already in his left eye," consistent with developing metastasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
    *   Future trips to regions or abroad would involve a double, an "inactive president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

### 3. To Mask International Humiliation
The lie also serves to cover up the "humiliation of the president in the international arena" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

*   **Turkey's Actions**: Turkey transferred Azov fighters to Ukraine, supported Ukraine's NATO accession, and promised intensive military aid, including the construction of Bayraktar drone factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. Russia's Kremlin and Putin were forced to remain silent due to Russia's critical dependence on parallel imports passing through Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Macron's Refusal**: The Kremlin has been trying to secure a telephone conversation between Macron and Putin, but the French president is refusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. This is a reversal of past situations where Macron would seek conversations with Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

## Failed Attempts to Compromise Prigozhin

Following the mutiny, official Russian media attempted to "compromise [[yevgeny_prigozhins_return_to_russia | Prigozhin]]" by publishing information about his "luxurious lifestyle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. However, this campaign was ineffective for several reasons:
*   **"No Negative PR"**: Any attention, even negative, keeps a figure like [[yevgeny_prigozhins_return_to_russia | Prigozhin]] "afloat" and "forming your fame" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
*   **Societal Immunity to Exposure**: Russian society has largely become "immune to exposure," partly due to the repeated publication of expos√©s (e.g., by Navalny's team) that do not lead to political change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This has led to a perception that such lavish lifestyles are the "norm" for those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
*   **Information Source**: The politically active part of society does not get its information from central television channels but from alternative sources like Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. The mutiny was the first major political event whose information and calls were primarily distributed via Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

## The Future of Russia

The speaker suggests that [[yevgeny_prigozhins_return_to_russia | Prigozhin]] will "most likely... turn out to be the icebreaker that split the ice surrounding Putin's regime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. This has opened up a "free space" that "other people" and "several groups or several networks" with aspirations for power will enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

This crisis situation presents a "unique opportunity" for ordinary citizens to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. It is crucial for citizens with a "civic temperament and a sense of conscience" to maintain "operational communication," primarily through Telegram, to receive necessary information about future actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>.

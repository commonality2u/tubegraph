## Humiliation of Foreign Minister Lavrov at the G20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>
Sergei Lavrov, the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, experienced public humiliation during the G20 Foreign Ministers' meeting on the island of Bali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. His colleagues refused to participate in meetings with him, take pictures, or have dinner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Journalists showed no interest in the minister of a country claiming superpower status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This event is considered a humiliation not only for the Russian Foreign Ministry but also for the [[Kremlins international relations and policies | Kremlin]], Russian power, and all of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Such treatment of Russia's Foreign Minister is reportedly unprecedented, even in Soviet times or the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This demonstrative humiliation can be seen as an "achievement" of [[Foreign policy and relations with Ukraine | Russian foreign policy]] and diplomacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## [[UK and Russian relations | UK and Russian Relations]]
The resignation of Boris Johnson as Prime Minister of Great Britain has direct bearing on Russia's affairs related to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Great Britain is considered the main protagonist of the anti-[[Kremlins international relations and policies | Kremlin]] coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. While the continuity of Britain's [[Foreign policy and relations with Ukraine | foreign policy]] course is expected, the [[Kremlins international relations and policies | Kremlin]] reportedly gloats over the events in Great Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

President Putin's personal dislike for the British is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This stems from his corporate affiliation as a Soviet KGB officer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The KGB traditionally fostered hostility towards the British, viewing them as the main competitors of Soviet intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This ingrained hostility towards British special services has been extrapolated to the British political class and British politics as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Britain is perceived by Russia as one of the orchestrators of serious intrigues against the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## [[European politics and relations with Russia | European Politics and Relations with Russia]]
In contrast to Britain, Germany is not seen as being in a hurry to help Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Chancellor Olaf Scholz, for instance, has allegedly blocked the allocation of a 9 billion euro aid package from the European Union for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. German authorities are believed to be acting in their own national interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

## Prospects for [[International relations and cooperation | Diplomacy]] in the [[Geopolitical tensions and Russias international relationships | Ukrainian Conflict]]
The conflict in Ukraine has dragged on with an unclear outcome, showing no strategic breakthrough in favor of either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This prolonged conflict is expected to bring serious problems, especially to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Reports suggest that Washington and key European allies are secretly discussing diplomatic ways to resolve the Ukrainian conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The aim is to minimize or abandon force and find a solution to the Russian-Ukrainian contradictions through dialogue and negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. However, a peaceful solution is deemed difficult until a turning point occurs or the parties are exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Ukraine's reaction to such diplomatic discussions is a planned counter-offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. The Minister of Defense of Ukraine, Oleksii Reznikov, stated that he received instructions to develop a counter-offensive to regain control of southern regions (Kherson and parts of Zaporizhia) from the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. A million-strong army is reportedly being prepared for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk urged Ukrainians in the Kherson region to leave, even through Crimea, anticipating it as the main battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

## Economic Measures and Internal Repressions
To mobilize resources for the long conflict, the Russian government has introduced a bill allowing the sale of jewelry abroad from state repositories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. This is likened to the early Soviet era when confiscated royal and aristocratic jewelry, and later Hermitage paintings, were sold abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

The government is also resorting to repressions, described as a "wave of repressions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. This includes actions against people wishing to participate in municipal deputy elections in Moscow and other regions, with strong candidates facing charges to prevent their registration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Aleksey Gorinov received a seven-year sentence for using a word prohibited in the Russian Federation (referring to the conflict as "war" instead of "special military operation") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. This is the first sentence for "discrediting the Russian army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>. Andrey Pivovarov, former director of Open Russia, faces a shorter term of five years for "carrying out activities of an undesirable organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

The government's actions against hockey players, such as Ivan Fedotov being sent to the North for military service and others accused of illegally acquiring military tickets, are interpreted as "information, moral, and psychological preparation" for mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. These "exemplary floggings" aim to show that everyone, regardless of fame, will be equal before mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. However, the government is reportedly unsure of a positive societal reaction to mass mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

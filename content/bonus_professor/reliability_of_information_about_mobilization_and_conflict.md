From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

This article addresses questions regarding the reliability of information about a potential second stage of mobilization and the broader armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine, as discussed by Valery Solovyov. It also delves into the psychological and practical [[consequences_and_impact_of_mobilization | implications]] for individuals and society. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

## Viewer Reactions to Mobilization News

Many viewers expressed distress and fear upon hearing about the possibility of a second stage of [[possibility_of_mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]], describing the news as a "nightmare" that caused sleeplessness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a> The speaker notes that most of his audience are men, over 35 years old, and citizens of the Russian Federation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:38">[01:38:38]</a> He emphasizes that [[psychological_reactions_to_mobilization_news | such reactions]] suggest an "infantile" mindset, akin to teenagers, who shield themselves from unpleasant truths. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:36">[02:36:36]</a> He contrasts this with "social maturity," which involves looking at events sensibly and impartially, accepting reality, and taking responsibility for one's actions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:04">[02:04:04]</a>

## Veracity of Information

The speaker asserts the high reliability of his information, drawing parallels to his past predictions:
*   **Armed Confrontation with Ukraine:** He claims to have discussed the inevitability of an armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine months before February 24, 2022, even naming the date with week-level accuracy in a conversation recorded on December 31. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:57">[03:57:57]</a>
*   **Mobilization and Martial Law:** Starting in spring, he stated that a decision to mobilize had been made, anticipating it would occur in the fall, albeit belatedly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:52">[04:52:52]</a> He also predicted the introduction of martial law. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:19">[05:19:19]</a> These predictions came to pass with the declaration of [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | partial mobilization]] on September 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:33">[05:33:33]</a> and martial law on October 20. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:38">[05:38:38]</a>

While acknowledging that only death and taxes are truly "inevitable," he stresses that his information indicates a "high, high probability" of a second stage of mobilization. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:05">[06:05:05]</a>

## Purpose of Information Dissemination

The speaker explains that he repeatedly shares this information for two main reasons:
1.  **Influence Decision-Making:** The wider the information spreads, the greater the chance that the "Supreme Authority" will hesitate before making harsh decisions or will implement them with less cruelty and on a smaller scale than initially conceived. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:21">[06:21:21]</a> He believes that disseminating information about upcoming decisions can either cancel or influence their adoption. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>
2.  **Preparation:** Informing the public allows people to prepare. "Whoever is forewarned is forearmed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:50">[07:50:50]</a> Spreading this information benefits individuals and compatriots. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:09">[08:09:09]</a>

## Mobilization as a National Test

The speaker views the attitude towards [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | mobilization]] as a "general national test" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:24">[08:24:24]</a> of intelligence, the ability to build cause-and-effect relationships, and the presence of a "will to live" (not merely a will to fight or power). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:29">[08:29:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:53">[12:53:53]</a>

He criticizes the narrative that citizens must fight to defend a "mighty, vast homeland" or natural resources, noting that these resources belong to a small group around the president, not the general populace. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:47">[08:47:47]</a> He challenges those who believe such rhetoric to actively participate themselves, rather than expecting others to sacrifice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:42">[09:42:42]</a>

He condemns those who expect to improve their financial situation or pay off debts through others' sacrifices in war. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:18">[10:18:18]</a> He warns that families will likely receive no compensation for lost breadwinners, stating that history shows such promises are often unfulfilled. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:44">[10:44:44]</a>

Receiving a summons and passively accepting it is seen as a sign of a "weakened survival instinct" and a "lack of will to live." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:48">[11:48:48]</a>

## Technical Aspects of Mobilization

### Scale and Composition
The speaker addresses the question of how 2 million people could be mobilized, explaining that Ukraine mobilized 1 million, and Russia traditionally relies on "throwing bodies" to achieve at least a draw. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:28">[13:28:28]</a>
This figure includes not only combatants but also:
*   **Support personnel:** This includes women (doctors, medical personnel), drivers of large transport, signalmen, and cooks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:24">[14:24:24]</a>
*   **Engineering and technical staff:** These individuals will be attracted to build fortifications on the front line under shelling, possibly paid a couple of thousand rubles a day and with the promise of double work experience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:57">[14:57:57]</a>

### Logistics and Equipment
Regarding who will provide uniforms and bulletproof vests, the speaker suggests it will be similar to the first stage, where families go into debt to equip their loved ones, noting this is a "colossal savings" for the state. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:53">[15:53:53]</a> He mentions that North Korea will provide machine guns and Iran will supply uniforms. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:36">[16:36:36]</a>

### Future [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | Mobilization Process]]
Authorities are expected to learn from past mistakes. Instead of distributing summonses at apartments, they will use integrated databases (pension fund, state services, traffic police) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:09">[00:00:00]</a> and face recognition systems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:22">[18:22:22]</a> Employers were obligated to provide information on military-liable employees by November 1. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:32">[18:32:32]</a> When martial law applies to regions or most of the Russian Federation, legal restrictions will be lifted, allowing authorities to stand at checkpoints of plants and offices to immediately send people to mobilization points. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:36:36">[17:36:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:53">[17:53:53]</a>

## Advice for Individuals

The speaker offers strategic advice to individuals:
*   **Use Intelligence and Will to Live:** If one possesses intelligence and a will to survive, they should use it to make decisions and fight for their single life, as there will be no second chances or compensation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:49:49">[19:49:49]</a>
*   **Financial Preparation:** It is advisable to have cash on hand, as the Russian banking and financial system is expected to collapse, though the timing is uncertain. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:09">[20:09:09]</a> Currency (dollar, euro) will remain valuable, even if banned, leading to a large black market. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:08">[21:08:08]</a> There will not be shortages of food or vodka. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:54:54">[20:54:54]</a>

### Call to Action
He encourages viewers to spread the information to benefit themselves and their compatriots, as "the more people will know and see, the better." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:28">[22:28:28]</a>

> [!NOTE] Social Maturity
> "Socially mature people look at life sensibly and prepare for what it brings; they try to hide their face in their mother's skirt." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:39">[21:39:39]</a> He hopes to address those with intellect and a "drop of will to live." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:53">[21:53:53]</a>

## Outlook
The speaker concludes with the unfortunate observation that there are few doubts about the coming events. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:15:15">[25:15:15]</a> He promises to continue supporting his audience and assures them that despite current difficulties, "victory will be ours." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:36:36">[25:36:36]</a>

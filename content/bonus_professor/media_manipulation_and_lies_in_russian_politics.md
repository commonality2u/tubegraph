The Secretary of the Russian President, Peskov, made a statement on July 10th, 2023, claiming that a meeting took place on June 29th between Yevgeny Prigozhin and the commanders of the Wagner private military company in the Kremlin with President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. According to Peskov, this meeting lasted three hours and ended positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. However, this statement is characterized as an "elementary brazen lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. No such meeting occurred on June 29th or afterwards, either collectively or individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The most that might have happened, and even this is doubted by more substantial sources, was a telephone conversation between Putin and Prigozhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Reasons for the Lies and [[russian_state_propaganda_and_its_influence | Propaganda]]

The leadership of Russia, including Peskov, needs to lie "shamelessly and brazenly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. There are several reasons for this [[the_influence_of_media_and_public_opinion_in_russian_politics | media manipulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### To Support Putin's Reputation

The primary reason is to bolster President Putin's reputation, showing him as a "wise Leader" who is "in complete control of the situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Despite Putin previously labeling Wagner fighters and Prigozhin as "vile rebels" who were "stabbing the country in the back," the reported meeting aimed to present the entire situation as a "cleverly conceived game" or "Putin's multi-move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This is necessary because Putin's reputation "suffered catastrophically" after the Wagner mutiny, particularly among the elite, the deep state, and partially society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### To Portray Putin as Physically Capable

The second reason for the lies is to project an image of Putin being in control and physically healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This is in contrast to the reality, where the "alleged president" appearing in public, such as in Derbent or in various public speeches, is described as "pure hoaxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The speaker claims that Putin "physically cannot meet with anyone and appear anywhere" and is "constantly replaced by a [[the_role_of_doubles_and_misinformation_in_russian_politics | double]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

There are reportedly two such doubles, one of whom is used for speaking engagements and is "very close to the president," though "not identical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The existence of these doubles is reportedly not doubted by any representative of the Russian elite or any "self-respecting intelligence service of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Skepticism remains primarily among the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

An examination conducted in a G7 country, involving phonoscopic (voice) and anthropological analysis by several independent experts, concluded that what is seen under the general name of the "President of Russia" are "three different people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

This campaign aims to present an "omnipresent president" around whom society is consolidating, who is "healthy, strong as never before," and "leads the country from success to success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The speaker asserts that Putin is in a "worse physical condition" and is "actually blind already in his left eye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

The widespread conversations about Putin's doubles, even if expressing skepticism, contribute to the "delegitimization of the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:10:30]</a>. This process is wide-ranging and involves more layers of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

### To Conceal International Humiliation

The third reason for the lies is to cover up Putin's "humiliation in the international arena" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

One example given is Turkish President Erdogan's actions, including transferring Azov fighters (banned in Russia) to Ukraine, supporting Ukraine's NATO accession, and promising intensive military aid and Bayraktar drone factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The Kremlin and Putin remained silent on these actions because Russia is "critically dependent" on parallel imports passing through Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Erdogan, referred to as "Raja or Sultan" by Putin, holds leverage, allowing him to "twist his northern vis-a-vis as he wants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

Another "invisible humiliation" involves the Kremlin's recent attempts to secure a telephone conversation with French President Macron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. Previously, Macron was the one seeking conversations with Putin, with over 100 hours spent on the phone in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Now, Putin wishes to speak with Macron, but the French president is refusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The Kremlin's servants are trying to reach Macron indirectly to convince him to talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

## [[Perceptions and narratives in Russian media | Official Media Narratives]] and Public Reaction

The Russian official media, particularly main TV channels, engaged in efforts to compromise Prigozhin by publishing information about his "luxurious lifestyle" and wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. This campaign is considered ineffective because "there is no negative PR" other than an obituary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Any exposure attracts attention and maintains fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.

Russian society has also developed an immunity to exposures, largely due to Navalny's team previously revealing high-level corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. When repeated exposures lead to no political action, the "novelty effect is exhausted," and a significant part of society begins to view such behavior as the norm, asking, "Well, why wouldn't you live like that?" or "Well, what if they have power they act like that this is the norm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

## The Role of Alternative Media

The politically active and civically engaged part of Russian society primarily draws information from sources other than central television channels, such as Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. The Prigozhin uprising was notably a political event where information and calls were distributed primarily through Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. The speaker emphasizes the importance of Telegram for operational communication during the ongoing crisis and future events, such as a potential coup d'état <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

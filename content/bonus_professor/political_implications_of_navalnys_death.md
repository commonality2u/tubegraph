The death of [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Alexei Navalny]] on February 16, 2024, after 7:00 PM, prompted an emergency discussion regarding its implications for Russian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The speaker expressed condolences to [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny's]] family, friends, and collaborators, acknowledging his inclusion on Russia's list of terrorists and extremists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny]] was recognized for his "amazing quality" and "commitment to the goals and objectives" he set, a distinctive trait of his as a politician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Natural Death or Political Murder?

The central question raised is whether [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny's]] death was natural or a political murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The speaker is "inclined in favor of the second version" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. An international etiological investigation would be necessary to convince the speaker that [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny's]] death was natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Even if the death were deemed natural, the speaker asserts that the Kremlin had been "creating all sorts of impossible conditions for the past few years" to "freeze Alexei," including nearly a year in a punishment cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. These conditions were "precisely intended to have a critical impact on his health, on his psyche," though [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny]] "coped with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Indirect signs supporting the political murder theory include:
*   A "very quick, unanimous reaction of the Russian official media" reporting the news "on command" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   An "unusually quick reaction" from Peskov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   At least two or three assassination attempts on "dangerous and important opponents" of the current elite group in Russia over the past month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Kremlin's Narrative and Motivation

The speaker anticipates a wave of "cynical lies and real nonsense," or "phantasmagoria," regarding the circumstances of [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny's]] death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Predicted narratives include:
*   [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Alexei Navalny]] being "actually alive and well and is abroad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   The West having "sacrificed him" to compromise upcoming "presidential elections" or "to blur the effect of the so-called interview" of Putin with Carlson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

This tactic is described as "blurring" in PR jargon, designed to "distract people's attention from the essence of what is happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

A common argument that [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny's]] death was "categorically unprofitable for the Kremlin" is refuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This argument was previously used for events like the murder of Nemtsov, [[Navalnys poisoning and its implications for Russian politics | Navalny's poisoning]], and the start of the "Russian military operation against Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Instead, the speaker argues that [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny's]] death is "profitable," "logical," and "consistent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The rationale is that the same people who orchestrated [[Navalnys poisoning and its implications for Russian politics | Navalny's poisoning]] have now "completed this operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The primary motivation is to "remove any risks, remove any threats on the eve of the so-called presidential elections" and, "most importantly, on the eve of the transfer of power" to an elite group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This involves "squeeze[ing] out all the grass, cement[ing] all the fields where this grass may appear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. The death also allows for "blam[ing] on the quiet path," implying external attribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Call for Transparency and Future Outlook

To refute "slander" and prove natural causes, the speaker challenges the authorities to:
*   Invite "international experts from Western experts" to conduct an "international public examination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   Release [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny's]] body to his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

[[Death of Alexei Navalny | Alexei Navalny]] possessed "colossal political potential" that he had not yet fully utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. The speaker emphasizes a crucial lesson: the tendency to "only know how to love the dead but not the living" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. He calls for love and support for living oppositionists, both inside and outside Russia, as "Russian oppositionists are under threat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

The year 2024 is predicted to be "very difficult," not just dramatic but likely "tragic," potentially "the hardest year in our entire life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Despite this grim forecast, the speaker concludes with a message of "confidence" and "hope," believing that "everything will change for the better" in 2024 and that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

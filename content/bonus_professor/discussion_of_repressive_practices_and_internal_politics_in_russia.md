This article summarizes the discussion of Russia's [[internal_political_developments_in_russia | internal political developments]], focusing on its shift in strategy, new propaganda narratives, and the intensification of [[repressive_laws_and_political_commentary_in_russia | repressive practices]] within the country. It also touches on [[kremlin_internal_political_dynamics | Kremlin internal political dynamics]] and international relations impacting Russia's [[current_state_of_political_and_social_issues_in_Russia | current state of political and social issues]].

## International Context and Western Relations

The granting of EU candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova is viewed as a symbolic gesture emphasizing the West's readiness to support Ukraine, despite the long path to full membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. This decision signifies Ukraine's and Ukrainian society's shift in their civilizational vector towards Europe, a change notably influenced by the actions of the Russian Federation and President Putin, who "literally pushed Ukraine out of the potential embrace of the Russian world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

### Western Pressure on Ukraine

There is an expectation of increasing behind-the-scenes, and sometimes overt, pressure from Western countries on Ukraine to agree to a peace treaty with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:03">[03:18:03]</a>. This pressure is attributed to the [[internal_political_dynamics_and_challenges_in_russia | internal problems]] faced by countries supporting Ukraine, including issues with gas, the Euro, and potential refugee flows from a food crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:17">[04:14:17]</a>. For example, Germany has publicly discussed nationalizing part of the Nord Stream pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:02">[04:34:02]</a>. The US administration's focus on domestic issues and upcoming midterm elections also contributes to this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:08">[06:04:08]</a>.

### Europe's Diminished Respect for Putin

The attitude of the Western establishment, particularly in key European countries, towards Putin has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:38">[14:51:38]</a>. This shift to "disrespect" began not with the start of the "special military operation" on February 24, but because Putin "could not and cannot quickly lead this operation to success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:15">[15:17:15]</a>. This reflects a view that he "was able to start but cannot deepen or finish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:38">[15:48:38]</a>. While fear may still exist, it's increasingly replaced by "contempt and mockery" for the Russian president and the perceived power of the Russian Armed Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:15">[16:04:15]</a>.

## Potential Second Fronts

### Lithuania and Kaliningrad Transit

A new conflict field has emerged due to Lithuania banning a significant part of transit to the Kaliningrad region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:46">[06:30:46]</a>. This decision was likely intended to demonstrate Lithuania's "independent sovereign status" rather than being a provocation orchestrated by Brussels, which is interested in improving relations with the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:13">[07:11:13]</a>. Russia is preparing to demonstrate force capabilities, engaging in "force blackmail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:19">[07:54:19]</a>.

### Belarus Involvement

To exert pressure on Lithuania, Russia considers involving Belarus in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:40">[08:14:40]</a>. Intensive negotiations between Putin and Lukashenko have taken place, with Putin pushing for a "real union" and involving Belarus in a network of force blackmail against Lithuania, as well as a military confrontation with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:06">[08:36:06]</a>. Lukashenko reportedly gave consent under duress but is expected to try and avoid full involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:12">[09:36:12]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Potential Economic Blackmail
> The European Union might resort to economic blackmail against Lithuania, threatening to withhold subsidies and transfers if Lithuania doesn't make concessions on the Kaliningrad transit issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:12">[10:52:12]</a>. This could prevent the opening of a "second front" in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:29">[11:25:29]</a>.

### Southern Front (Taliban/Tajikistan)

A potential second front could open in the South, near Russia's borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:04">[11:30:04]</a>. The Taliban, previously designated an extremist organization in Russia, are reported to have received $5 billion in compensation (cash, oil, equipment) from the Kremlin to prevent them from invading Tajikistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:03">[11:44:03]</a>. This is critical for Russia, as it has concentrated its efforts on Ukraine, and an aggression against CSTO member Tajikistan would require Russia to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:03">[12:11:03]</a>. However, negotiations are underway to encourage the Taliban to strike Tajikistan in August, potentially opening a southern front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:19">[12:54:19]</a>. This aligns with a statement from the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Budanov, who predicted "turning points" in August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:48">[13:31:48]</a>.

## [[Russias Internal Political Dynamics and Changes | Russia's Internal Political Dynamics and Changes]]

Russia has shifted its strategy from a failed "Blitzkrieg" to preparing for a "long confrontation," transitioning to a "besieged fortress" regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:42">[16:14:42]</a>.

### Propaganda Shift: "New Normal"

A decision has been made to "slow down, lower the temperature" of mobilization ideology and move towards a "new normal" propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:07">[17:22:07]</a>. Starting around autumn, Russian propaganda will convey that "it is good," that Russia has "never lived" without confrontation with the West, and people should "get used to this" and "seek pleasure in what we have now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:09">[17:38:09]</a>. This aims to inject a "new positivity" and "optimism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:29">[18:18:29]</a>.

### Intensification of [[Repression and political climate in Russia | Repressive Practices]]

The "besieged fortress" regime prioritizes control over society through administrative and police measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:18">[18:27:18]</a>. These [[cultural_and_political_repression_in_russia | cultural and political repression]] practices include:

*   **Expansion of "Foreign Agent" Law**: The law on "foreign agents" has been extended to include individuals under "Western influence," which can be vaguely defined as having studied a foreign language, traveled abroad, or corresponded with foreigners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:37:37">[18:37:37]</a>. This mirrors Soviet-era suspicions of being a "cheat" or exposed to "Western influence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:04">[18:55:04]</a>.
*   **Amendments to "State Treason" Law**: Amendments concerning "state treason" imply that "unauthorized contact" with a foreigner could be considered near-treason, punishable by up to eight years fine or a fine of one million rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:18">[19:08:18]</a>. These are described as "exactly exactly Stalinist practices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:16">[19:30:16]</a>. The goal is not mass imprisonment but using isolated cases to create a multiplier effect through modern media, intimidating a wider segment of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:20">[19:36:20]</a>.
*   **Selective Introduction of Exit Visas**: There's a "selective introduction of exit visas," preventing certain individuals from leaving Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:28">[21:10:28]</a>. An example is the denial of travel to renowned director Sakurov for a conference in Milan, based on "direct instructions of the Moscow leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:48">[20:44:48]</a>. This serves as a punishment, forcing individuals to "stay in your homeland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:29">[21:21:29]</a>. These trends are expected to intensify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:44">[21:35:44]</a>.

### Use of Magical Rituals

The authorities do not appear confident in their success or victory, as evidenced by their turn to "dubious things like magical rituals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:57">[21:51:57]</a>. On June 22, the summer solstice, a black magic ritual was held at 4 AM (mirroring the time of the war's announcement) involving high-ranking Russian Federation officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:21">[22:06:21]</a>. The purpose of this ritual was to grant victory to the Russian army and strengthen Putin's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:04">[22:41:04]</a>.

### [[Kremlin internal political dynamics | Internal Kremlin Political Dynamics]]

A coalition of oligarchs (including Deripaska, Abramovich, Potanin, and Chubais) is beginning to form an "anti-patrol" alliance against the security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:34">[23:35:34]</a>. Oleg Deripaska's "hasty reaction" and "rude sarcastic rebuke" in his Telegram channel against claims of conspiracy involvement suggests these messages have touched a nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:31">[24:08:31]</a>.

Valery Solovey, a Russian political scientist, provided insights into [[current_political_climate_and_leadership_in_russia | Russia's political climate]] and the state of [[Putins political challenges and potential leadership changes | Putin's leadership]] during a challenging period. Solovey noted that public perception and internal dynamics indicate a shift in [[russian_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Putin's political influence]] [00:41:40].

## Decision-Making and Responsibility
Despite speculation, Vladimir Putin remains in control of the levers of power and there is no indication of his removal from power this year [01:39:00]. However, he has shown an unwillingness to appear in public with bad news or bear responsibility for difficult decisions, often shifting them to Moscow Mayor Sobyanin and regional governors [01:47:00]. While demanding action, Putin has not provided the necessary resources to support these demands [02:07:00].

The current legal status in Russia is undefined, referred to as "my charge" rather than a state of emergency, because the government does not want to bear financial and legal responsibility to society [02:17:00]. This contrasts with how Western countries and the United States have acted [02:36:00].

## Economic Challenges and Dependence
Russia's economic power is not comparable to that of Western countries like Germany, Great Britain, or France [02:43:00]. Despite official figures suggesting sufficient gold and foreign exchange reserves and a National Welfare Fund, Russia is critically dependent on oil prices [02:54:00]. According to government estimates, if the status quo is maintained, resources may only last until October or November [03:21:00]. This financial strain leads to practical steps like limiting expenses and the consideration of lowering the ruble exchange rate to 100 per dollar, a move Putin has resisted but has been persistently offered [03:33:00].

## [[public_perception_of_putins_health_and_leadership | Public Perception and Disappointment]]
A significant factor affecting [[Putins leadership and political influence | Putin's political influence]] is his apparent lack of confidence in his own actions [03:58:00]. Historically, Putin was considered a factor of stability [04:05:00], but for the first time in 20 years, he has become a factor of destabilization [04:10:00].

This inability to take responsibility has led to massive disappointment among the public [04:50:00]. Putin's traditional electorate—people who were never interested in politics, always voted for him, and believed he had no alternative—have seen their sympathy turn to hatred [05:01:00]. This intense hatred was evident after a recent speech where he failed to announce a broad program of assistance and support, instead placing the burden on governors who lack resources [05:51:00]. The public response, as seen in letters and phone calls, has been characterized by unprecedented despair combined with hatred [06:06:00]. While an immediate mass uprising is not expected, a qualitative change in political behavior is anticipated by the fall [06:30:00].

## International Relations and Oil Diplomacy
Putin personally made the decision to withdraw from the OPEC+ deal, a move that was deeply offensive to Saudi Arabia and other OPEC participants, particularly the Saudis [01:11:30]. This decision created a strong personal conflict between Putin and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, who has repeatedly refused to speak with Putin by phone [01:37:00].

Beyond the OPEC deal, the Saudis received information that the Kremlin was involved in leaking information related to the Khashoggi scandal [01:14:00]. The alleged motivation was to isolate Saudi Arabia through sanctions and hostile European attitudes, thereby pushing them into Russia's arms [01:51:00]. This revelation, possibly delivered through Turkish channels, further strained relations [01:41:00].

In response to the personal conflict, Russia appealed to Trump to mediate with the Saudi Crown Prince [01:39:00]. As a condition for his intervention, Trump reportedly secured a promise from Russia to leave Venezuela and cease supporting Maduro [01:53:00]. This deal, which involved a transfer of Rosneft assets to the Russian state, was seen as a way for Russia to secure some Venezuelan assets while yielding to U.S. demands in their "backyard" [01:56:00].

Despite these developments, the future of oil prices remains uncertain. Global economic growth is needed for high prices, and widespread economic decline is anticipated [01:19:19]. Even if prices rise, Russia considers $40 per barrel acceptable, but it's not guaranteed they will reach that level, and prices are expected to remain in a low range through much of next year [01:35:00].

## Constitutional Changes and [[putins_political_challenges_and_potential_leadership_changes | Political Instability]]
Putin initiated constitutional changes that are seen as undermining the very foundations of the regime's activity and legal tradition [03:35:00]. His idea of resetting presidential terms, though he may not have intended to fully utilize it, caused strong irritation [03:47:00]. The entire procedure for these changes is considered illegitimate, making the resulting constitution potentially invalid from a legal standpoint [03:51:00].

The current [[russian_political_climate_and_leadership | Russian political climate]] is characterized by increasing governmental stress and a perceived decline in Putin's "luck" [02:11:00]. Once known for his good fortune, members of his inner circle now whisper that luck has abandoned him [02:19:00]. The confluence of the epidemic, falling oil prices, and the constitutional crisis contributes to a sense that "every day plays against Putin and against the government" [03:59:00]. The mood is becoming increasingly negative [04:06:00].

## Future Outlook and [[impact_of_leadership_changes_on_russian_political_climate | Leadership Changes]]
Russia is facing significant changes, with the political and state structure known for the last 20 years beginning to collapse rapidly [03:36:00]. This process could take on an "avalanche-like character," leading the authorities to focus on "survival and confrontation with domestic political image" rather than sanction relief [03:57:00].

Speculation about potential successors is ongoing, with Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin currently being discussed [03:49:00]. Sobyanin was reportedly promised the head of the State Council post for successfully managing Moscow's self-isolation, but he faces opposition from security forces [03:57:00].

The situation is unpredictable, but Solovey expressed confidence that new people will emerge in [[internal_politics_and_power_dynamics_in_russian_leadership | Russia's political leadership]] [04:27:00]. Some within the ruling elite are already discussing how to preserve their assets and positions [04:36:00].

Regarding Ukraine, Russia's intentions remain unchanged [02:41:00]. While the immediate goal of bringing Ukraine to the negotiating table has been hampered by natural reasons, the Kremlin expects Ukraine to seek help and is conducting preparatory work with Ukrainian officials [02:46:00]. There is a possibility of Russia sending medical assistance, including "military virologists," to Ukraine [02:14:00].

Putin is highly interested in the results of the US elections and would like Trump to win [04:42:00]. Russia will attempt to help Trump, possibly by providing information on the Biden family's interests in Ukraine [04:49:00].

The crisis is expected to significantly reduce Russia's interest in the Donbas region by late autumn or winter [04:45:00]. While Russia may not fully abandon its emotional presence, it will likely cease active engagement [04:59:00]. The scale of the internal crisis in Russia will determine the extent of this shift [04:11:00]. However, Russia has been actively issuing Russian passports in Donbas, aiming to reach one million holders, effectively creating an important and manageable electoral resource for internal Russian plebiscites [04:43:00].

An offensive in Donbas is possible if Russia deems it necessary to pressure Ukrainian leadership or distract its own society from domestic problems [05:13:00]. This moment, when the internal crisis unfolds, presents a significant threat of war [05:24:00].

Valery Solovyov discusses the current [[Militarypolitical situation in Russia and Ukraine | military-political situation in Russia and Ukraine]], including future projections for mobilization, martial law, and broader societal impacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This is the third episode of his "Answers to Hot Questions" program, recorded on Friday, November 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Escalation of Military Action and Mobilization

The speaker states that Russian President Vladimir Putin has abandoned the idea of peace negotiations and a peace agreement with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. As a result, an escalation of military action is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This escalation will manifest in several ways:
*   A second stage of mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   The introduction of martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Restrictions on the remaining civil liberties and rights for Russian Federation citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Second Stage of Mobilization

A second stage of mobilization is highly probable, though not 100% certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. It is expected to be announced after the New Year holidays, likely in mid-January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This stage will be more comprehensive than the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. It might not even be called "mobilization" but rather fall under the concept of "people's war" proposed by Kiriyenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This second stage will include categories of people not covered in the initial mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

From the authorities' perspective, the first stage of mobilization was successful, with people generally complying despite reluctance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. The Kremlin believes those mobilized have "nowhere to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Expansion of Martial Law

Currently, martial law applies only to the "new territories" within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. However, it is anticipated to expand to other territories, including the capital and large cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The timing will depend on the situation's dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

Martial law imposes several restrictions:
*   Limitations on travel outside the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   Potential restrictions on movement between regions within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   The right to travel abroad will likely be limited for those in the "mobilized base," estimated at about seven million people, including women with military registration specialties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   Any person can be detained or interned for up to 30 days without charges, with potential extensions for an unlimited period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   Military-civilian authorities will gain the right to requisition premises, transport, and similar necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   Authorities can impose curfews and restrictions on cultural, educational, and entertainment establishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

These measures are expected to be implemented after the New Year as part of the "popular wave of war" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Potential for Change of Power in Russia

The chances of a change of power in Russia in the current year are small, though not zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Significant but perhaps "invisible" events in December could stimulate a change of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. However, it is more likely to happen next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The speaker warns that a change from the current power structure to the most likely successor could result in a worse, albeit temporary (a few months), situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Russia is expected to become a free, democratic country within the speaker's lifetime, but not soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. It might take 10 to 15 years, or more, for democratic institutions and procedures to function effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

The main driving force for a potential "Russian coup" will be the elites, not the opposition or society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. It will initially develop as an elite conflict, with some factions seeking societal support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The recent "Warsaw Congress of people's deputies" is seen as primarily a PR exercise with negligible practical results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

Predictions about Putin's departure from Russian politics in 2022 are not being abandoned, but the likelihood is decreasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. The "horizon is approaching," and his legal capacity term is "extremely limited" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. His entourage is aware of this and may accelerate the process, especially as [[Military and political dynamics between Russia and Ukraine | military action escalates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Forecasts by Andrey Valerievich Kosmos align with other sources regarding Putin's departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### External Threats and Russia's Future

If Russia were to have different leadership, external threats would be significantly minimized, particularly from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The main challenge and danger for Russia would then lie in the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

Despite approaching "turmoil" which is deemed inevitable, the speaker is optimistic that it will not lead to the collapse or death of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. While Russia will face serious upheavals, potentially more dangerous and acute than the 1993 crisis, the country and society will cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Ukraine's Stance on Israel

Ukraine systematically votes against Israel in the UN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This position is politically motivated, stemming from Israel's perceived lack of assistance to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The speaker considers this stance erroneous and counterproductive for the Ukrainian authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

## Nature of Cruelty in Conflict

Regarding the reported cruelty of Russian soldiers, the speaker advises against generalization, noting that "facts of cruelty are observed on both sides" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. However, the observed trend of Russian soldiers' behavior is depressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

Two main reasons for this attitude are proposed:
1.  **Destructive dehumanizing propaganda:** Constant portrayal of opponents as "Nazis, scoundrels, mercenaries of the West" leads to ceasing to perceive them as human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This is common in intense military conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
2.  **Cruelty inherent in Russian social relations:** Russian society is described as very cruel, with this cruelty being absorbed daily through socialization, starting from family and kindergarten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. The speaker views this as a "colossal defect" rather than an advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

The speaker expresses deep compassion and sympathy for those who have died, been wounded, or maimed in the [[Ukraine Russia conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.

## Belarus's Future

Belarus's future depends entirely on the dynamics of the political situation in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. If a crisis begins in Russia, Lukashenko will likely have to leave his post, and Belarus will naturally distance itself from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

## Ukrainian Armed Forces Entering Russian Territory

The possibility of Ukrainian armed forces entering Russian territory, particularly towards Moscow, is not expected to involve a deep penetration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. While this possibility is considered by Russia's military leadership, leading to the creation of defensive barriers in border areas and Crimea, it is assumed that Ukrainian forces will not go beyond these border zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

## Advice for Citizens Amidst Conflict

Citizens are advised to form a survival strategy based on their personal situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.
*   If you or family members are of draft age and subject to mobilization, consider if you want to end up in the trenches and act accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   If resources allow, leave Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
*   If moving within Russia is an option, consider it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   The fundamental question is whether one values their life and the lives of loved ones over inconvenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

### Practical Recommendations for Survival

*   Legally acquire weapons if possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.
*   Coordinate with neighbors (in the entrance, stairwell, house, yard) on forms of interaction, as this will be necessary next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

### Advice for Minors and Young Families

*   School students are strongly recommended to go to study, verifying state accreditation to ensure deferment from conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
*   If studying is not possible, find a place to "sit out a few very difficult months" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.
*   If able to go abroad and sustain oneself, leave now, especially before the second stage of mobilization makes it impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
*   The main advice is to act in accordance with one's values, prioritizing life and freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.
*   Young, mobile families are also advised to make an existential choice based on valuing life and freedom over the threat of death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

## Putin's Health and Doubles

The speaker recommends watching a program with American doctor Victor Serebryany from Johns Hopkins University, who evaluates Putin's medical diagnoses from a psychoneurological and professional perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

Intriguing circumstances mentioned regarding Putin's health:
1.  When watching videos or looking at photographs, it's uncertain if it's Vladimir Putin or a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. A double is not necessarily sick with the same conditions as the Russian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.
2.  Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin behaves as if the Russian president "no longer actually exists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.
3.  The near future will provide the best answers regarding Putin's health and physiological outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>.

## Linguistic Considerations: "In Ukraine" vs. "On Ukraine"

The speaker explains his use of the preposition "in" when referring to Ukraine (e.g., "in Ukraine" instead of "on Ukraine") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. He follows a tradition of the Russian language, not a norm, when addressing his predominantly Russian audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>. When interacting with Ukrainian audiences, he uses "on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. He asserts there are no imperial ambitions in this choice, but rather respect for the Russian language and an effort to respect the feelings of people on different sides of the confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite gloomy prospects, the speaker believes that "light awaits us," and "the sun of a new Russia" will emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>. He concludes by stating, "No matter how hard it is now, victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

Valery Solovey presented the 132nd episode of "What's Happening" on Monday, July 15, at 1:00 PM Moscow time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. He addressed concerns about his recent silence, explaining it was due to a very busy and intensive trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## International Events and Assassination Attempts

### Attempt on Donald Trump's Life
Solovey noted that an attempt was made on the life of US presidential candidate Donald Trump on Saturday, July 13, during a rally in Pennsylvania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. He refrained from speculating on who was behind the attempt, whether it was a lone wolf, an organization, or a "hit conceived by a game of the Soviet KGB" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Solovey believes that this assassination attempt, during which Trump was "saved literally by a miracle," will likely play a decisive role in his ascent to the presidential chair, making his chances of becoming the new US president prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Alleged Assassination Attempts on Russian and Ukrainian Leaders
Solovey referred to a statement by Budanov, the head of Ukrainian military intelligence (declared an extremist and terrorist in Russia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, who claimed Ukrainian intelligence made several unsuccessful attempts to assassinate "President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Solovey clarified that none of the attempts to assassinate "President Putin" before February 24, 2015, even reached the stage of organizational preparation, remaining at the level of conversations and discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. He stated that "President Putin" was one of the most, if not the most, protected people in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

After February 2022, the idea of assassinating the Russian president certainly came to mind, just as the idea of assassinating the Ukrainian president came to the Russian military-political leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The Russian leadership had counted on [[Russia and Ukraine conflict dynamics | Zelensky]] leaving Ukraine or moving to western Ukraine, and a "hunt began for him," which was unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Later, several missiles were fired at locations where [[Russia and Ukraine conflict dynamics | Zelensky]] was present, and a "purge" in the State Security Service in Ukraine was linked to moles of Russian intelligence in [[Russia and Ukraine conflict dynamics | Zelensky's]] inner circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. These attempts did not succeed due to highly professional security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Solovey doubted that Ukrainian attempts to assassinate the "late Putin" ever reached the organizational stage due to the security of the "person who replaces the late Putin" being "first class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Internal Russian Affairs: Internet Censorship and Political Outlook

### YouTube and WhatsApp Blocking
Solovey highlighted a significant development in Russia: exercises were carried out last week to block YouTube by slowing it down and creating problems for its normal functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. These exercises were ordered by Nikolai Patrushev, who is responsible for this sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The military-political leadership deemed these exercises "relatively successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

As a result, a decision was made to block YouTube nationwide in August-September, not gradually, but "one-time," similar to how Facebook and Instagram were banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. They also intend to block WhatsApp along with YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Solovey advised viewers to:
*   Acquire one or more reliable VPNs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. He acknowledged that the government will block VPNs but described it as an ongoing "fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   Register on Telegram, as authorities are not planning to block it due to past unsuccessful experiences and the belief that it is impossible to block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. He recommended subscribing to Telegram channels connected to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

He explained that the government fears YouTube as a source of information and WhatsApp as a coordinator for protest mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, especially ahead of anticipated problems in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. While the authorities do not expect the blocking itself to cause a mass negative reaction leading to actions, it will be an additional factor of tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. They view the blocking as a necessary risk to avoid "much more serious problems" in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

### [[Political and economic conditions in Russia | Political and Economic Outlook]]
Solovey mentioned that these "serious problems" include [[Potential economic and political crisis in Russia | political and economic problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. He stated that despite appearances of stability, there is an intense latent struggle behind the scenes that will lead to a [[Potential economic and political crisis in Russia | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. The [[Political and economic conditions in Russia | economic situation]], despite "victorious reports," is extremely worrying to the authorities, who consider problems "inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

Conversations about mobilization have returned to the agenda of the military leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Solovey noted that there are very influential people in the Russian leadership who are against mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. He plans to discuss these issues in more detail during an online meeting on July 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Informed sources suggest the situation will become "extremely critical" closer to the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### [[Social unrest and potential for protest in Russia | Public Sentiment and Dissatisfaction]]
Solovey confirmed that the Federal Security Service conducts sociological measurements of mass sentiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. He stated that [[Public dissatisfaction and political implications in Russia | dissatisfaction with the authorities]] is "great" and "extremely" high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. However, this dissatisfaction does not translate into a readiness to oppose the authorities, with people preferring to demonstrate "emphatically loyalist" or opportunistic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

Regarding the question of staying in Russia or leaving, Solovey stated that the decision depends on an individual's psychotype, ambitions, resources, and limitations, as there is no universal answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>.

### Migrant Policy
Following the terrorist attack in Crocus, the government changed its policy on migrants, though these changes may seem insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. Solovey suggested that a "systemic" policy would include introducing a visa regime with Central Asian countries to protect the country's safety, health, and way of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

## Conclusion and Outlook
Solovey expressed confidence that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>, defining it as Russia's "liberation," an "honest and fair life in the country," a focus on internal development rather than aggressive foreign policy, and the happiness of its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. He believes the overwhelming majority of people share this view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. Solovey anticipates that the "critical situation" will arise this fall, possibly closer to the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

## Overview of General SVR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>
General SVR is an anonymous Telegram channel that has gained significant attention in [[Russian political dynamics and power struggles | Russian political dynamics]]. The channel is managed by several high-ranking officers from various special services of the Russian Federation, including both retired and active personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Identity and Credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>
The speaker, a professor, personally knows at least one of the individuals involved in running the channel, specifically the one who participated in a program with Evgenia Albats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This individual is confirmed to be a General, not a Ukrainian lawyer or SMM-shchika <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The speaker has known this person for a long time and has had opportunities to verify the quality and reliability of the information they provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Evgenia Albats also takes the information provided by General SVR quite seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

The channel's rapid growth indicates its impact, having entered the top 100 world Telegram channels by coverage per post within less than five months of its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Initially ranked 99th two days prior to the broadcast, it had risen to 85th place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. These are considered "colossal achievements" for a channel with such a short history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Reactions from Official Figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
The information disseminated by General SVR provoked a sharp reaction from figures such as Aleksey Alekseevich and Aleksey Venediktov, the editor-in-chief of Echo of Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This reaction, including Venediktov's tweet about drinking whiskey with a "real General SVR" (Yuri Kobaladze, who left service in 1999), is seen as an attempt to distance themselves from the anonymous General SVR due to external pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Information Leaks and Their Significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>
Leaks of sensitive information from the Kremlin have "sharply increased" in the two months prior to the broadcast, reaching an "unprecedented" level not seen in over 20 years, potentially comparable to the period after August 1991 in the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. These leaks are attributed not to top officials, but to those "in the shadow" of these officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. Their motivation is a concern for their future after Vladimir Putin's departure, seeking security guarantees from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

The General SVR channel plays a "colossal" role in clarifying the background of events like terrorist attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. Its content is widely read and taken seriously within the Kremlin, by propagandists like "General Vanya," and by all major Western and Eastern intelligence services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.

> [!INFO] Specific Insights from General SVR
> While the speaker notes that information regarding Vladimir Putin's health comes from major world intelligence agencies and not directly from General SVR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, the channel has reportedly provided information about:
> *   The "rite of thirty-three misfortunes" synchronizing with political dates in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This will be the topic of a lecture on February 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
> *   The FSB's alleged involvement in the Magnitogorsk terrorist attack and the Kogalymavia plane explosion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>. The speaker confirms other sources corroborate this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:14]</a>.
> *   A story about Yuri Kovalchuk giving Vladimir Putin a platinum record engraved with "people, you are suckers," which the speaker confirmed as reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>.

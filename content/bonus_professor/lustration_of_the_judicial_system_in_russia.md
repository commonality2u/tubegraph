From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The proposed future government in Russia plans to implement [[lustration_and_future_legal_implications_in_russia | lustration]] within the judicial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This process aims to reform the existing system to ensure justice and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Scope of Lustration

The [[lustration_and_future_legal_implications_in_russia | lustration]] process will specifically target key positions within the judiciary:
*   **Judges** All judges, including those from the Supreme Constitutional Court, will be subject to [[lustration_and_future_legal_implications_in_russia | lustration]] without exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This is considered an "unconditional principle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   **High-Level Officials** Within the judicial apparatus, high-level officials such as heads of departments of the Supreme Court or similar positions in the Constitutional Court will also undergo [[lustration_and_future_legal_implications_in_russia | lustration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Exclusions from Lustration

Lower-level employees of the judicial system, such as case manufacturers and clerks, will generally not be subject to [[lustration_and_future_legal_implications_in_russia | lustration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The reasoning is that these individuals did not make decisions and could not influence outcomes, regardless of their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Lustrating all apparatus employees would lead to "chaos" and "emptiness" in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The approach will be "flexible and realistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Implementation and Future Reforms

The [[lustration_and_future_legal_implications_in_russia | lustration]] of the judicial corps will take some time to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
The broader goal of future [[political_and_social_reforms_in_russia | reforms]] includes:
*   **Repealing harmful laws** All laws and by-laws that worsen living conditions or harm people will be repealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.
*   **Compensation for victims** Individuals who have suffered due to such laws will receive compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.
*   **New department for legality** A special department or service, possibly named the "Department of Management" or "Service for the Restoration of Constitutional Legality," is proposed to oversee these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Humanization of the system** The Russian penal system needs to be humanized, not tightened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>. The speaker, now an opponent of the death penalty, questions severe punishments if the court system is not effective and honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.

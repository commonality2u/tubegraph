Recent developments in the formation of the Russian government highlight the significant [[influence_and_interests_of_foreign_countries_in_russian_politics | influence and interests of foreign countries]] in domestic [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian politics]], particularly that of [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics | China]]. The appointment of the Prime Minister and subsequent government shifts were shaped not only by internal elite struggles but also by external pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Internal Coalitions and Initial Plans

The political landscape leading up to the new government's formation was dominated by two main coalitions: the Chemezov coalition and the Patrushev coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. These two groups remain the primary determinants of [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | domestic Russian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Initially, an agreement was reportedly reached in late November for Dmitry Patrushev to become Prime Minister, with expectations that the government would be radically renewed by 75-80 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. It was also suggested that Dmitry Patrushev would become the heir to "President Putin" (described as a double) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

However, by mid-February, Patrushev's plans encountered "very strong and apparently insurmountable resistance" from the Chemezov coalition, which categorically opposed Dmitry Patrushev's bid for Prime Minister and President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This led to a stalemate, with Dmitry Patrushev being the Patrushev coalition's candidate and Denis Manturov being the Chemezov coalition's candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Compromise options, including Anton Vaina and Alexey Dyumin, were also considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## China's Decisive Intervention

The final decision on the Prime Minister was significantly influenced by [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics | China]]. It became apparent that China was advocating for Mr. Mishustin to become Prime Minister of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

Mishustin reportedly personally appealed to "day Pin" (likely referring to Xi Jinping) because he made a solemn promise to fulfill all obligations towards China that had been assumed by the "late President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. As a direct condition of Mishustin's appointment, Chinese counterparts pledged to approve a visit by the "so-called president" (the double of the late President Putin) to Beijing in mid-May of this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

This direct foreign influence caused strong irritation among the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. The elite recognize Russia's critical dependence on China for both military and economic support, acknowledging that without it, Russia cannot sustain military operations or its economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. However, the "humiliation" of having an external power dictate their will and requiring approval for leadership appointments is a significant source of internal tension within the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

## Compromise and Continued Tensions

The appointment of Mishustin was part of a "rotten compromise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. As part of this, Denis Manturov became First Vice-Premier and Dmitry Patrushev became a Vice-Premier, increasing their "apparatus weight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. While the Chemezov coalition's position improved in the socio-economic part of the government, Patrushev's coalition maintained and even strengthened its position in the security bloc <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

Nikolai Patrushev, despite leaving his post as Secretary of the Security Council, intends to "go into the shadows" while maintaining control over the security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. This is part of the fragile compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Sergei Shoigu, who became Secretary of the Security Council, is considered an "absolute void" as control remains with Patrushev's first deputy, Nurgaliev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

This compromise is not considered long-term by any party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. The internal tension between the two coalitions is expected to intensify and be "discharged" soon, potentially leading to bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>. This ongoing struggle, exacerbated by external influences, is expected to bring about further "turbulence" in [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

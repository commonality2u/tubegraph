This program, recorded on Sunday, June 19, focuses on two main issues: recent negotiations in Kyiv and the shifting political landscape in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Negotiations in Kyiv and Western Support

Recent expectations surrounding the visit of the "big three" (Draghi, Macron, and Scholz) to Kyiv were that they would persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to engage in peace talks with Russia, potentially involving territorial compromises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Behind the scenes, discussions did revolve around this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. It was speculated that Draghi and Macron were the primary persuaders, possibly due to the Kremlin holding compromising information ("dirt") on them, while Scholz was reportedly a less active participant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

However, the public statement issued after the negotiations was directly opposite to these initial intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. It declared unconditional support for Ukraine's position, including its territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. It was also made clear that peace negotiations would not proceed without Ukraine achieving some success on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

The shift in position can be attributed to several factors:
*   President Zelenskyy's firm stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   The resolute position of the United States, Great Britain, and a significant portion of NATO countries, who favor either "war to a victorious end" or establishing conditions for peace negotiations on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   The psycho-emotional impact on the "troika" after visiting Irpin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Following the "big three's" visit, Boris Johnson's trip to Kyiv further confirmed the UK's unconditional solidarity with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The crucial aspect is not just declarations of support, but the provision of real military assistance, both in size and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Such aid should enable Ukraine to achieve at least equality, or even decisive superiority, over the [[russian_military_actions_in_ukraine | Russian Federation]] to create a [[strategic_turning_point_in_ukraine_conflict | strategic turn on the battlefield]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

The United States is seen as the primary nation capable of providing this level of assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. It appears the US is prepared to deliver this aid, regardless of the risk of escalating conflict with the [[russian_military_actions_in_ukraine | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Significant [[us_aid_to_ukraine_and_its_implications | US aid to Ukraine and its implications]], including weapons, is expected to arrive in July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This aid will be accompanied by Ukrainian personnel trained in the US and NATO countries to operate these weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. If this materializes, qualitative changes on the battlefield could be observed by late July or early August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

David Arakhamia, the head of Ukraine's negotiating group with Russia, stated that Ukraine might resume negotiations with Russia at the end of August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This timing is based on his calculation that by then, Kyiv's negotiating position should be strengthened, which implies not only the arrival of new weapons and professionally trained Ukrainian forces but also a serious change on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Potential changes could include the return of Kherson under Ukrainian control and a counteroffensive in Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. However, the prospect of resumed peace talks does not necessarily mean peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

Both Boris Johnson and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg have called on NATO countries to prepare for a long campaign and sustained assistance to Ukraine, potentially lasting several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This assistance would include military aid, support for state infrastructure, and aid for reconstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Kremlin's Strategy and Internal Political Landscape

From the Kremlin's perspective, while it is also preparing for a long special military operation, achieving some result by the end of autumn or early winter would be important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This timeline is driven by internal political dynamics, specifically an anticipated decision regarding the transfer or transit of power, possibly even the gradual replacement of President Putin, which could begin in late autumn or early winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. At that point, the internal political agenda would take precedence, making an extended [[russian_military_operations_in_ukraine | military agenda]] excessive and disruptive to primary political tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

President Putin's speech at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum was noted for its lack of seriousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Attendees, particularly large businessmen, reportedly showed grim expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

A significant development is the formation of a "drain coalition," or "anti-Chekist/anti-Patrushev" coalition, within the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This is described as a realization of previous hypothetical discussions about a split in the elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Members of this coalition include Roman Abramovich, Anatoly Chubais, Vladimir Potanin, and Oleg Deripaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Oleg Deripaska notably refused to applaud Putin upon his entry at the forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This coalition also includes the "Yeltsin family," credited with Putin's rise to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

The coalition opposes Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council, who is reportedly trying to position his son Dmitry, the Minister of Agriculture, as Putin's successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. This proposed succession is meeting strong resistance not only from oligarchs but also from elements within the power structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. A powerful elite coalition has emerged against the continued dominance of the security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This struggle has already begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

Another group within the elite is seen as potential successors, possibly aligning with the anti-Patrushev coalition: Finance Minister Anton Siluanov as president and Central Bank head Elvira Nabiullina as head of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This indicates a clear confrontation between "civilians" and "security forces" within the [[militarypolitical_situation_in_russia_and_ukraine | Russian elite]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

The struggle for "Putin's Russia" intensified in recent weeks, driven by the elite's awareness that Putin will soon have to leave his position or significantly reduce his public political presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This is seen as the beginning of a "hunting season" for those who pose a threat or whose removal would send a signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Recent strange deaths of oil workers and the reported unnatural death of Alexey Agafonov, former head of Uralvagonzavod, are cited as examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

Citizens are encouraged to observe this process, which is just beginning, and prepare for potential opportunities to influence Russia's historical trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. The coming months are expected to be difficult and painful for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

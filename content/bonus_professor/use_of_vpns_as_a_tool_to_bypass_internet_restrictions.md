In Russia, the government is taking measures to restrict access to certain online platforms, making tools like Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) essential for users to maintain access to information and communication.

## Planned Internet Restrictions
Exercises to slow down and block YouTube were carried out last week, based on instructions from Nikolai Patrushev, who is responsible for this sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. These exercises were considered relatively successful from the perspective of the military-political leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Based on the results of these exercises, a decision was made to [[planned_blocking_of_youtube_in_russia_and_its_implications | block YouTube]] on a nationwide scale in August or September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The plan is for a "one-time" block, similar to how Facebook and Instagram were previously banned in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. In addition to YouTube, the government also intends to block the messenger WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

The authorities aim to block these platforms to prevent the coordination of actions and negotiations through services like WhatsApp, effectively limiting opportunities for protest mobilization ahead of anticipated problems in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. While the government anticipates a negative emotional reaction to the blocking, they do not expect it to translate into widespread active opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. From the authorities' viewpoint, this blocking is a necessary risk to avoid much more serious political and economic problems expected in the near future, specifically this fall and early winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## Role of VPNs and User Advice
To counter these restrictions, users are advised to acquire reliable VPNs, possibly more than one, to ensure a reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The government will attempt to block VPNs, but this is viewed as an ongoing battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

YouTube is expected to lose part of its audience due to the block, similar to what happened with Instagram and Facebook, as some users will be afraid or technically unable to use VPNs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Government Countermeasures
The Russian authorities have made a decision to block any information that informs or advertises how to use VPNs, including technical instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Such public instructions and advertising are prohibited by law in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This contributes to the broader [[information_iron_curtain_and_media_restrictions_in_russia | information iron curtain and media restrictions in Russia]] and [[media_censorship_and_freedom_of_information_in_russia | media censorship and freedom of information]].

### Recommendations for Users
Despite these [[restrictions_and_measures_taken_by_the_government | restrictions and measures taken by the government]], it is recommended that users:
*   **Obtain VPNs:** Seek help from friends or acquaintances who use VPNs to find and install reliable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Register on Telegram:** Create an account on Telegram, as authorities do not plan to block it due to previous unsuccessful attempts and a belief that it is impossible to block in principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Telegram channels are recommended for receiving operational information during a critical situation, particularly in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

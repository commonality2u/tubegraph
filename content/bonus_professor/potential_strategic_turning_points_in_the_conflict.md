The conflict has entered a positional phase, characterized by skirmishes and stubborn battles for populated areas with little advancement, rather than large-scale operations seen in 1943 [00:00:39].

## Intentions and Resources for a Turning Point

Both the Russian and Ukrainian sides retain the intention of achieving a [[strategic_turning_point_in_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]] [00:01:17]. For Ukraine, this intention is actively supported by its Western allies [00:01:25].

A turning point fundamentally depends on resources, both [[strategic_military_resources_and_international_negotiations | military]] and moral/psychological [00:01:31].

### Ukraine's Position
Ukraine is largely assured of military and technical resources through an uninterrupted supply line [00:01:36]. The challenge for Ukraine is also its moral and psychological resources, and the society's capacity to endure the conflict's burdens while its armed forces skillfully resist and, if necessary, launch a counteroffensive [00:01:50].

Russian [[Military Strategy and Developments | military policy]] aimed to exhaust Ukraine's resources and demoralize its society to force a peace treaty on Russian terms [00:02:12]. However, resources continue to flow into Ukraine faster than Russia can deplete them, and the goal of demoralizing Ukrainian society has not been achieved [00:02:21]. The [[strategic_turning_point_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]] remains as distant as it was at the outset of the special military operation in late February [00:02:44].

### Russia's Position
Unlike Ukraine, Russia has limited [[strategic_military_resources_and_international_negotiations | military resources]] and receives no external assistance in this regard [00:03:02]. Questions exist regarding the moral-political and moral-psychological state of the Russian armed forces and society [00:03:12].

The stated goals of Russia's operation have been rewritten multiple times [00:03:24]. Initially, it aimed for "denazification" and "demilitarization," implying complete political control and regime change in Ukraine [00:03:38]. Currently, the more modest tasks include complete control of Donbas, the Azov coast, and potentially the Black Sea coast [00:03:49]. While control of the Azov coast is largely achieved, the Black Sea coast objective has not yet begun [00:04:00].

A [[strategic_turning_point_in_russianukrainian_war | strategic turning point]] will not be achieved by the Russian Federation [00:04:15]. Some high-ranking Russian military leaders, including General Staff generals, doubt that even the limited military goals of the operation's second stage can be met [00:04:19].

## Tools for Achieving a Turning Point (from Russia's Perspective)

Two primary tools are being considered by Russia to achieve a [[strategic_turning_point_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]]:
1.  **Mass Mobilization** [00:04:41]: Crushing Ukrainian armed forces with "human mass" [00:04:49].
2.  **Tactical Nuclear Strikes** [00:04:53]: Inflicting tactical nuclear strikes on Ukraine.

### Mobilization in the Russian Federation

The topic of mobilization has become central due to the conflict entering a positional phase [00:00:31]. A decision regarding mobilization has been made by the President of the Russian Federation [00:09:39]. Preparation for mobilization has been ongoing since the first day of the special military operation, with the Security Council, under Nikolai Patrushev, reporting to Putin that everything is organizationally and technically ready [00:05:14]. They also believe mass mobilization would not lead to negative political consequences [00:05:36].

However, the implementation of this decision is not guaranteed, and the timing remains uncertain [00:09:48]. It is planned to mobilize approximately half a million people in 3-4 stages, depending on the public reaction [00:10:10].

Methods of enforcement for mobilization being discussed include [00:10:24]:
*   Military registration and enlistment office employees, possibly accompanied by police, visiting homes. Anyone with a military ID aged 17-50 is theoretically subject to mobilization [00:10:30].
*   Blocking bank cards of those subject to mobilization [00:10:47].
*   Closing borders for those subject to mobilization [00:10:56].

### Justification for Mobilization and Escalation

For a public declaration of mobilization, events are needed to justify it from a propaganda perspective [00:11:35]. These events would need to demonstrate that Ukraine poses an "existential threat" to the Russian Federation [00:11:51]. Potential events include:
*   Chemical attacks [00:12:06].
*   Terrorist attacks in large Russian cities, including the capital and St. Petersburg [00:12:06].

Such events would elevate the conflict's status from a "special military operation" to a "full-fledged and large-scale war" [00:12:36]. This would also legitimize the possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons, framing it as necessary to destroy an existential threat posed by "Ukrainian Nazis and Banderites" [00:12:48].

### The Role of Vladimir Putin's Logic

Arguments against mobilization based on technical infeasibility or political unprofitability for Putin are dismissed as similar reasoning was used before February 24th to argue against a conflict with Ukraine [00:06:47]. The logic guiding Vladimir Putin is described as fundamentally different from that of experts, operating within his own worldview and premises that may seem strange to others [00:07:15]. His views on history significantly influence his political decision-making [00:08:27].

## Broader Implications

The possibility of nuclear strikes, even with tactical warheads, is presented as something that "should not be" but, like the events of February 24th, could still happen given "other forms of thinking" with "colossal power" in decision-making [00:15:00]. There is a sense that those close to power either cannot or are afraid to stop these processes [00:15:50].

A psychological symptom of despair and anger is observed within the Russian Federation, both at the "bottom" and "top," characterized by hysterical statements from prominent figures [00:16:19].

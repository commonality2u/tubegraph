This article summarizes the military and political situation of the past week, focusing on [[Russias foreign policy strategy with Europe | Russia's foreign policy strategy with Europe]] and the role of [[european_leaders_influence_on_ukraine_peace_talks | European political influence]] in potential [[peace_negotiations_and_kremlins_perspective | peace negotiations]] with Ukraine. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>

## Russia's Shifting Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>

While the surrender of Azovstal fighters was a military and symbolic success for Russia, it did not constitute a strategic turning point in the conflict with Ukraine. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> Ukrainian troops successfully counter-offended near Kharkiv, and fierce battles on the Seversky Donets are unlikely to favor Russia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>

For at least two weeks, both sides have been in a "clinch" with a positional fight. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a> However, signs emerged last week that the Russian Federation is increasingly counting on consolidating the current territorial status quo rather than achieving a [[strategic_military_resources_and_international_negotiations | strategic military]] turning point. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> The aim is to enter [[peace_negotiations_and_kremlins_perspective | negotiations]] with Ukraine to legalize the territorial gains of the past three months. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> This includes the recognition of Crimea as Russian, Donbas as independent, and Russian control over the Kherson region and part of the Zaporizhzhya region (forming a land bridge to Crimea). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>

## Revival of Russian Influence Agents in the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>

A key symptom of Russia's shift in strategy is the revival of [[international_relations_and_the_involvement_of_russian_figures | Russian agents of influence]] within the European Union. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>

*   **Silvio Berlusconi:** Last week, retired Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi, a personal friend of Putin, publicly stated that Europe must convince Ukraine to accept Russia's conditions in [[peace_negotiations_and_kremlins_perspective | negotiations]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>
*   **Italian Foreign Ministry:** Almost simultaneously with Berlusconi's statement, the Italian Foreign Ministry sent proposals to end the conflict, which, while not as pro-Russian as Berlusconi's, could be quite profitable for Russia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>
*   **French and German Politicians:** It is also noticeable that French and German politicians are explicitly or implicitly offering to make peace with Ukraine "here and now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>

### Reasons for European Leaders' Stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>

There are several reasons why some European leaders are cautiously pushing for peace:

1.  **Russian Leverage:** Russia has leverage and influence over certain European politicians, specifically mentioning French President Macron and German Chancellor Schulz. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>
2.  **Fear of Escalation:** European leaders are generally afraid of conflict escalation, which could involve non-conventional weapons and an increase in refugees. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> The current six million refugees outside Ukraine represent a significant financial and social burden on EU countries, which they do not wish to increase. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>
3.  **Global Famine Threat:** The continuation of the conflict limits Ukraine's ability to export grain, leading to growing concerns about global famine due to interrupted logistics. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a> Russian propaganda and officials are also playing up this threat. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>

## Ukraine's Position and International Support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>

Ukrainian President Zelensky maintains that the outcome of the conflict will be achieved on the battlefield. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> He states that [[peace_negotiations_and_kremlins_perspective | peace negotiations]] will only begin once one side (meaning Ukraine) achieves a military advantage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>

Ukraine's intention is supported primarily by the "Anglo-Saxon duo" (Great Britain and the United States), as well as Poland and the Baltic countries. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>

### US Counter-Influence on European Leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>

According to sources from the United States, the US has "in an unflattering manner" made it clear to Chancellor Schulz (and Macron) that "dirt" exists on them in the US, not just in the Russian Federation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a> The US has conveyed that it would be more correct for these leaders to adhere to the principles of Euro-Atlantic solidarity and the NATO-developed course of unconditional support for Ukraine. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> This course implies "waging war to a victorious end" on the part of Ukraine. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>

## Contrasting Approaches and Future Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>

Russia is consistently trying to "crawl out of the conflict" by moving towards [[peace_negotiations_and_kremlins_perspective | peace negotiations]] on its own terms. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a> In contrast, Ukraine continues to count on a strategic turning point, aiming for technological military superiority. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a> A Ukrainian counteroffensive is likely by the end of summer or early autumn. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>

Ukraine's far-reaching plans include restoring the territorial status quo to at least February 24, and potentially reclaiming Donbas and even Crimea. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a> This intention causes tension on the Russian side, evident in propaganda statements about Ukraine crossing the Russian border being a "disaster." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a> The Russian General Staff's realistic perspective suggests that if Ukraine crosses the border, all of Russia's territorial achievements, potentially even in Donbas, could be reset. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>

Russia is already constructing defensive fortifications in newly acquired territories, indicating preparations for defense. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a> Despite official statements claiming territories like Kherson are "forever with Russia," [[historical_understanding_and_its_influence_on_politics | historical understanding]] suggests such permanence is uncertain, drawing parallels to the unexpected collapse of the Soviet Union. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>

### Internal Russian Discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>

Discontent is rising within Russia, particularly among the "KGB lobby," regarding the failure of the import substitution program over the past 14 years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a> Despite colossal budget allocations and reports of success, the program is seen as having failed, with issues of "Chineseization" and serving personal and group interests rather than national ones. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a> This discontent among security officers indicates that the system, which revolves around Putin, is beginning to "vibrate" and disintegrate as the "key element" (Putin) shows signs of weakening, including serious health problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>

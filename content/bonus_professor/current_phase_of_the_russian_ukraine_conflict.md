The central topic of discussion on May 6th concerns the possibility of mobilization in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, as the special military operation has entered a positional phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This means there are no large-scale operations like tank breakthroughs or envelopments reminiscent of 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, but rather a positional skirmish with minimal advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> and stubborn battles for populated areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Strategic Intentions and Resources

Both sides retain the intention of achieving a [[strategic_turning_point_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Ukraine's Position
The Ukrainian side's intention for a [[strategic_turning_point_in_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]] has emerged and is actively supported by Ukraine's Western allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Ukraine is not expected to face a shortage of military and technical resources, as an uninterrupted supply line is largely provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Key resources for Ukraine include moral and psychological fortitude, society's ability to bear the conflict's burdens, and the armed forces' capacity to resist skillfully and potentially launch a counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Russia's Position
Russian military policy towards Ukraine aimed to deplete Ukraine's resources and demoralize Ukrainian society to force a peace treaty on Russian terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. However, resources continue to flow into Ukraine faster than Russia can neutralize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, and Russia's goal of demoralizing Ukrainian society has not been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The [[strategic_turning_point_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]] remains as distant as it was at the conflict's outset in late February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Unlike Ukraine, Russia has limited military resources and receives no external assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. There are significant questions regarding the moral-political and moral-psychological state of the Russian armed forces and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Shifting Russian Goals
The actual goals of the operation have been rewritten multiple times over two and a half months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>:
*   **Initial Goals:** "Denazification" and "demilitarization" of Ukraine, implying complete political control and regime change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Revised Goals:** Complete control of Donbass and apparently control of the Azov and Black Sea coasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. While control of the Azov coast is largely achieved, implementation for the Black Sea coast has not yet begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

Some high-ranking Russian military leaders, including General Staff Generals, doubt that even the limited goals of the second stage of the special operation can be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Therefore, a [[strategic_turning_point_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]] will not be achieved by the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Potential Escalation: Mobilization and Nuclear Strikes

To achieve a [[strategic_turning_point_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]], two tools are being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>:
1.  Crushing Ukraine's armed forces with human mass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, which implies mobilization of human resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
2.  Inflicting tactical nuclear strikes on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Mobilization Plans
Mobilization has been discussed and prepared for since the first day of the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The Security Council, under Nikolai Patrushev, reports that from an organizational and technical perspective, everything is ready for mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, and it is believed there will be no negative political consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

A decision regarding mobilization has been made by the President of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, although the timing for its implementation is not yet designated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The plan is to mobilize about half a million people in several stages (3-4 stages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Tools to motivate people to mobilize may include military registration and enlistment office employees visiting homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, blocking bank cards of those subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, and closing travel abroad for those subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Anyone with a military ID between 17 and 50 is theoretically subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. The previously discussed date of May 9th was merely one of the options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

Mobilization must be preceded by events that, from a propaganda perspective, justify its necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. These justifying actions would aim to show that Ukraine poses an existential threat to the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Such events could include a chemical attack or terrorist attacks in large Russian cities, including the capitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. These events would serve as a pretext to publicly declare that the homeland is in danger, transitioning the conflict from a special military operation to a full-fledged, large-scale war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

### [[potential_escalation_of_military_conflict_between_russia_and_ukraine | Potential Use of Tactical Nuclear Weapons]]
This shift in status would also legitimize the possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The logic presented is that if Ukraine poses an existential threat, it must be destroyed, and the world would supposedly be grateful for its removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

## Analysis of Decision-Making and Public Sentiment

Similar reasoning was heard before February 24th, when experts argued that a [[ukraine_russia_conflict | conflict]] with Ukraine was impossible and unprofitable for Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This perspective failed to account for the fact that Vladimir Putin's logic is fundamentally different from that of external experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. His rationality operates within his specific worldview and relies on premises that may appear strange to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, influenced by his views on history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

The possibility of preventing these developments is considered slim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. While theoretical chances exist if public sentiment against mobilization is critically discussed and reported to Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>, individual strategies for self-preservation are also a consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. The argument that weapons of mass destruction or tactical nuclear strikes seem implausible is dismissed, referencing the unexpected start of the conflict on February 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. It is highlighted that there are "other forms of thinking" with "colossal power" that are difficult to comprehend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## [[militarypolitical_situation_in_ukraine_and_russia | Current Atmosphere in the Russian Federation]]
Psychological symptoms indicate that things are not going well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Hysterical statements from public figures and media, characterized by cynicism and baseness, suggest that these individuals are not in their best mental shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Despair and anger are prevalent in the atmosphere of the Russian Federation, not only among the populace but also at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

This article is based on answers to "hot questions" from viewers, broadcast on Thursday, November 2, at 1 p.m. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30">[00:30]</a>.

## Clarifications and Corrections
The speaker corrected an error regarding the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation. Article 357, previously cited as concerning violent seizure and retention of power, actually pertains to genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12">[01:12]</a>. The correct article for violent seizure and retention of power is 278 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18">[01:18]</a>.

## Internal Political Dynamics

### FSO Exercises and Putin's Death
The Federal Protective Service (FSO) conducted exercises from November 1-3, which are stated to be regular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32">[01:32]</a>. However, the speaker suggests connecting these exercises, particularly the emphasis on the possible use of armored vehicles, with the reported death of the president on the evening of October 26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53">[01:53]</a>.

### Political Persecution: The Case of Nikolai Korolev
Nikolai Korolev, a former police officer known for refusing unconstitutional orders, faced legal persecution after requesting an investigation into propagandist Simonyan's alleged statement about a nuclear strike over Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57">[02:57]</a>. Despite the quote being widely distributed and media outlets citing it, only Korolev faced legal action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56">[03:56]</a>. The speaker views the case against Korolev as an act of [[political_crisis_and_economic_implications_in_russia | political persecution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52">[03:52]</a>.

### Social Networks and Surveillance
Surveillance on social networks in Russia is expected to strengthen, not weaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58">[07:58]</a>. This is attributed to Nikolai Patrushev's team, who are described as the current supreme rulers of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00">[08:00]</a>. This tightening of controls is anticipated ahead of a planned transfer of power, as a double cannot lead Russia indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12">[08:12]</a>.

### Patrushev's Role and Oligarchs
Nikolai Patrushev is described as someone who "hates the oligarchs" and "hates Putin's entourage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:12">[20:12]</a>. He is characterized as a "man of the old formation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17">[20:17]</a>.

### Shoigu's Ambitions
Despite his desire, Shoigu is deemed unable to seize power, as he lacks support from elite groups, who generally hold a "skeptical and hostile attitude towards him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12">[24:12]</a>.

### The Return of Prigozhin
The speaker believes Prigozhin will return after Putin's death, choosing the "most suitable moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15">[04:15]</a>. This moment is anticipated to be when "internecine struggle for power begins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30">[04:30]</a>.

## Economic Overview

### Ruble Exchange Rate
After a period of strengthening, the ruble exchange rate is predicted to fall again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36">[02:36]</a>. This decline is seen as "generally inevitable" given the current state of the [[economic_challenges_in_russia | Russian economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38">[02:38]</a>.

### Demographics and Debt
A viewer expressed concern that Russians, especially in Moscow, are heavily burdened by loans, debts, and mortgages, making it difficult to raise children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41">[11:41]</a>. Demographic trends are described as deeply ingrained and cannot be reversed quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00">[12:00]</a>. Even with serious efforts starting now, any positive effect on the birth rate among the indigenous population might only be seen in 10-15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08">[12:08]</a>. The speaker's team has a program aimed at increasing the birth rate among Russia's indigenous peoples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36">[12:36]</a>.

## The Situation with Putin's Doubles and His Death

### Confirmation of Doubles
A study, partly published by The Moscow Times (republished from the Daily Mail/Sun), indicates the presence of Putin's doubles based on anthropological examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35">[05:35]</a>. More reliably, a phonoscopic examination conducted by Japanese researchers also confirmed the presence of doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05">[06:05]</a>. The speaker affirms there are at least two doubles: "Vasilich," who replaced the deceased president, and a "technical double" used for public appearances where speaking is not required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29">[24:29]</a>. The FSO naturally controls these doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50">[24:50]</a>.

### International Awareness of Putin's Death
The speaker confirms that the West, China, and Israel are aware of Putin's death and are reportedly satisfied with the current state of affairs, interested in maintaining the existing regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47">[12:47]</a>. The Ukrainian side, however, has not made any public statements, possibly due to fear of making a mistake or because their intelligence is not strong in "strategic political intelligence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15">[13:15]</a>. Additionally, the Ukrainian leadership might be afraid that confirmation of Putin's death would shift the dynamics of peace negotiations, removing a key obstacle they had officially cited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40">[13:40]</a>.

### Plans for Burial
The speaker states that Putin will not remain unburied indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42">[16:42]</a>. The main question remains regarding "what cause of death will be announced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45">[16:45]</a>.

## Foreign Relations and Conflicts

### Russia-Ukraine Conflict

#### Prospects for Peace
There is a predominant desire within the Russian elite to conclude a peace agreement with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17">[11:17]</a>. The speaker hopes that peace will be concluded by a "new government of the new Russia," rather than the current one, which is seen as a continuation or even a more severe modification of Putin's government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26">[11:26]</a>.

#### Ukrainian Leadership's Stance
The speaker questions what peace formula the Ukrainian leadership, specifically Zelensky, is ready to accept, particularly after recent publications in the American press suggest some of their stated demands are not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11">[14:11]</a>.

#### Current Military Strategy
Russia intends to launch an offensive on Avdiivka, despite colossal losses, believing that taking it will increase the chances of the West forcing Ukraine into peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55">[22:55]</a>. Simultaneously, the new Russian leadership, particularly Patrushev, is proposing peace talks through Lukashenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19">[23:19]</a>.

### Threat to Lithuania
In 2019, Putin had plans for a large-scale "hybrid operation" against the Baltic countries, which was General Gerasimov's idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12">[15:12]</a>. This plan was not implemented due to the start of the pandemic and warnings from American and NATO leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38">[15:38]</a>. Currently, Russia has no plans regarding Lithuania or the Baltics, as it has no time or ambition for such actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50">[15:50]</a>.

### Developments in Chechnya and the Caucasus
The transfer of heavy weapons to Chechnya is interpreted as Ramzan Kadyrov's awareness of what transpired in the Kremlin, including the approximate day of Putin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00">[21:00]</a>. Kadyrov is creating two new battalions and receiving heavy weapons from the Wagner private military company for his own purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37">[21:37]</a>. Kadyrov is expected to play his own game, "first of all, against the current Russian government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49">[21:49]</a>. Regarding the events in Dagestan and the likelihood of a third Chechen war, the speaker notes that hostility and weapons are accumulating in the Caucasus, and "interested parties" like Patrushev will ensure that Chechnya does not go "free floating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31">[23:31]</a>.

### Abkhazia's Future
The speaker does not know any Abkhazians who wish to return to Georgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00">[22:00]</a>. While acknowledging Georgia's "colossal losses," the speaker suggests that "a bad peace is better than a good quarrel" in this long-standing and painful conflict, indicating no easy solution acceptable to both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26">[22:26]</a>.

### Russian Intelligence Abroad
The speaker suggests that some Russian intelligence networks abroad, which have been "simply stuffed" with agents, are likely to be deemed meaningless and recalled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48">[19:48]</a>.

## Calls for Public Action and Support

### Mass Movement for Change
To transition to a democratic European reality, people need to participate in a "mass movement" when the opportunity arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10">[02:10]</a>. The path is "only one way," requiring perseverance until victory without turning back once having taken to the streets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19">[02:19]</a>.

### Supporting Independent Information
The speaker encourages active, even open, participation in politics, though acknowledging the risks involved like solitary pickets or fines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50">[17:50]</a>. Minimally harmful activities include subscribing to the speaker's Telegram channel "Doctor Nightingale" and the "General SVR" Telegram channel, which is recommended for "reliable, high-quality, up-to-date information about [[social_and_political_changes_in_russia | Russian politics]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25">[18:25]</a>. Users can also repost videos and "put likes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51">[18:51]</a>. Financial assistance to the speaker's team is also requested, with emphasis on donating only feasible amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00">[19:00]</a>.

### Future Outlook
The speaker emphasizes the importance of preserving physical and mental health, as "we will finally be able to influence the fate of our long-suffering country" and its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:31">[25:31]</a>. Despite the current difficulties, the speaker concludes with a hopeful message that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56">[25:56]</a>.

Leri Solovey, speaking from Moscow, presents the 75th episode of "What's Happening," which was rewritten due to a significant statement from Russian Presidential Secretary Peskov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Kremlin's "Elementary Brazen Lies"

Peskov stated on July 9th that a three-hour meeting between Yevgeny Prigozhin, commanders of the Wagner private military company, and President Putin took place in the Kremlin on June 29th, ending on a "good positive note" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Solovey asserts that this statement is an "elementary brazen lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. He emphasizes that no such meeting occurred on June 29th or afterward, either collectively or individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The maximum possible interaction, and even this is doubted by more substantial sources, might have been a telephone conversation between Putin and Prigozhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Reasons for the Deception

Solovey outlines several reasons why Russia's leadership and Peskov felt compelled to lie so shamelessly:

*   **To bolster [[Putins leadership and political influence | Putin's reputation]] and image of control:** The primary reason is to portray [[Putins leadership and political influence | Putin]] as a "wise Leader" in "complete control of the situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This narrative aims to suggest that the mutiny was part of a "cleverly conceived game" or "Putin's multi-move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This is critical because [[Putins leadership and political influence | Putin's reputation]] "suffered catastrophically" in the eyes of the elite, the deep state, and society after the Wagner coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **To assert [[putins_health_and_public_perception | Putin's physical capability]] and health:** The second reason, inextricably linked to the first, is to show that [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin is capable and healthy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Solovey claims that all recent public appearances and actions, such as the alleged visit to Derbent or public speeches, are "pure hoaxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. He asserts that the real president "does not appear anywhere" and is "physically unable to do this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **To mask [[Putins political challenges and potential leadership changes | Putin's humiliation]] in the international arena:** The third reason for the lies is to conceal the "humiliation of the president in the international arena" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## [[putins_health_and_its_influence_on_russian_politics | Rumors of Putin's Doubles and Health Decline]]

Solovey alleges that the president is "constantly replaced by a double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. He states that two doubles are most often used, with one being "very close to the president" for speaking engagements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. He asserts that the existence of a double is not doubted by "any representative of the Russian elite" or "any self-respecting intelligence service of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

### Evidence for Multiple "Putins"

Solovey cites an examination conducted in a G7 country, which included "phonoscopic examination" (by voice) and "anthropological examination" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Several independent experts involved in this examination unanimously concluded that "under the general name of the President of Russia," they observe "three different people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Current Physical State

According to reports from a "very reliable source" via the Egam channel, [[putins_health_and_its_influence_on_russian_politics | Putin]] is in a "worse physical condition" and is "actually blind already in his left eye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This is considered "completely natural" given how metastasis is developing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Solovey describes [[putins_health_and_its_influence_on_russian_politics | Putin]] as a "lame duck" and a "dying nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, incapable of making decisions publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Any trips to regions or abroad are undertaken by a "double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

### Impact on Public Perception

The ongoing conversations about doubles contribute to the "delegitimization of the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This process is widespread and involves increasing layers of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Even discussions, regardless of belief in the hypothesis, shape the discourse and contribute to the "formation of such a global agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This strategy aims to create the impression of a "omnipresent president" around whom society consolidates, who is "healthy [and] strong as never before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## International Humiliation

Solovey highlights specific instances of [[Putins political challenges and potential leadership changes | Putin's international humiliation]]:

*   **Erdogan's actions:** Erdogan transferred Azov fighters to Ukraine, supported Ukraine's NATO accession, and promised intensive military aid, including Bayraktar drone factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The Kremlin and [[Putins leadership and political influence | Putin]] "have to keep quiet" because Russia is "critically dependent on the so-called parallel import that passes through Turkey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This allows Erdogan to "twist his say northern vis-a-vis as he wants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **Macron's refusal:** In recent days, the Kremlin has been attempting to secure a telephone conversation between Macron and [[Putins leadership and political influence | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. This is a reversal of previous situations where Macron sought conversations with [[Putins leadership and political influence | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. However, the French president is now "refusing him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Kremlin servants are using "roundabout ways" to convince Macron to speak with [[Putins leadership and political influence | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

## The Unfolding Crisis

The speaker notes that the Russian elite and Western elite understand that [[Putins leadership and political influence | Putin]] is not just a "lame duck," but a "dying nature," incapable of making and publicly announcing decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. The attempted military rebellion by Prigozhin was considered "much more important" by Russian citizens than the ongoing special operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Official Russian media tried to compromise Prigozhin by exposing his luxurious lifestyle, which is seen as an ineffective PR strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Russian society is generally "immune to exposure," partly due to the work of Navalny's team, which has led to a feeling that corruption is the "norm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

The speaker warns that Prigozhin has acted as an "icebreaker that split the ice surrounding Putin's regime," creating a "free space" that other groups, potentially several networks, are preparing to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. This situation represents an ongoing crisis that provides a "unique opportunity" for ordinary citizens to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

The current state of [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | Russia's political situation and leadership]] is characterized by significant concerns regarding the legitimacy of its top officials and legal framework. It is asserted that the individual currently performing the role of [[russian_political_system_and_leadership | President of Russia]] is a double, lacking personal will and effectively under house arrest, both factually and legally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## Presidential Authority and Legality
The long-term performance of presidential duties by a double, referred to as "Vasilyevich," is expected to be publicly announced in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. This revelation is anticipated to be a "world shock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. Despite this, Western governments are believed to be fully aware of the situation but find it convenient, indicating a lack of concern for the truth if it does not harm their interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

The "illegitimate period of rule" resulting from a double performing presidential duties will lead to the sweeping away of all signed agreements, decrees, and amended laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. This is deemed necessary for the establishment of a [[future_leadership_and_governance_in_russia | new Russian Republic]], as the former republic (established 1991-1993) has been irrevocably destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

The current individual acting as president is controlled by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Most politicians are either afraid to speak about the double or are interested in maintaining the myth that "Putin is alive" because they are satisfied with the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Admitting the truth would require a radical change in the coordinate system, which many find difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## Transparency and Accountability
Upon a change of power, there is a commitment to declassify KGB and FSB documents, with the exception of top-secret units, to reveal the truth about past actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. The names of all informers who worked "against Russian society" will be published, as their records are preserved despite any promises made to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. This wave of "extremely unpleasant revelations" aims to ensure that "evil is punishable" and to prevent similar occurrences in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

### Moral Responsibility
While society may attempt to forget or "hush up" the armed conflict and their attitude towards it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>, it is considered unfair to allow this to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. The true history of what has happened to Russia, especially over the last quarter-century, needs to be covered and reported as part of school socialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>.

However, [[moral_and_political_implications_for_russian_leadership | moral responsibility]] is an individual category that cannot be imposed if people are not ready to accept it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>. The goal is to tell the truth, open people's eyes, and make historical and humanitarian education truthful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>. It is hoped that a new societal framework will allow individuals to confront their past and present more honestly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>.

## Judicial and Law Enforcement Reforms
Serious changes are expected in all law enforcement agencies, including the Investigative Committee, by the fall of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. These changes may involve leadership shifts within departments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.

The Dima Yakovlev law is viewed negatively and will be repealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>. Those who initiated it and harmed children in orphanages are subject to "fair punishment" under the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:20:00">[18:20:00]</a>.

The Russian Guard, created for personal use, will be liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:16:00">[18:16:00]</a>, as its practical meaning and logic are not understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:00">[18:22:00]</a>.

The FSB, while necessary for the state, requires "radical, radical reform" â€“ the "most large-scale and profound" transformations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:25:00">[39:25:00]</a>.

## Societal Issues and Future Outlook
Individuals who committed crimes during the armed conflict will be held accountable, while those who did not will bear [[moral_and_political_implications_for_russian_leadership | moral responsibility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:58:00">[29:58:00]</a>. The importance of personal responsibility is emphasized, distinct from collective responsibility, which is rejected as a form of totalitarianism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:43:00">[30:43:00]</a>.

A program will be implemented to address former conflict participants, including registration for those with EPTS (likely PTSD), special medications, and psychiatric/special registration to prevent "constant conflict and violence" in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:52:00">[40:52:00]</a>. This program draws on the experiences of other countries and Russia's own history with wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:20:00">[41:20:00]</a>.

The aim is to "tear Russia out of this cycle" of cyclical repetition of situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:49:00">[36:49:00]</a>. Success depends on the governing group, their action plan, and public support, with necessary components for changing Russia's historical trajectory reportedly in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:05:00">[37:05:00]</a>.

Valery Solovey discusses various aspects of [[reforms_and_future_directions_for_russia | future reforms and directions for Russia]], including legal and political changes, in response to viewer questions.

## Judiciary and Law Reform
The idea of [[lustration_of_the_judicial_system_in_russia | lustration]] in Russia is considered "absolutely necessary" for the future, particularly regarding the judiciary system, which should be fully subjected to lustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:47">[02:11:47]</a>. This process should also be enshrined in law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:02">[02:40:02]</a>. The speaker anticipates an era similar to 1985-1999, but with positive manifestations, not those that typically cause negative associations for many Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:24">[02:51:24]</a>.

### Accountability for Aggressive War
There is a belief that individuals will eventually be convicted under Articles 353 (planning, preparation, or waging an aggressive war) and 354 (public calls for unleashing an aggressive war) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:40">[03:38:40]</a>. Specifically, there are "ready candidates" for convictions under Article 354, whose property abroad is already frozen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:08">[03:43:08]</a>.

## Governance and Constitutional Changes
A constituent assembly or constitutional conference is anticipated to establish a new Russian Republic and adopt a new Russian Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:07">[09:33:07]</a>. This body will also consider changes to the current coat of arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:02">[09:40:02]</a>.

### Reburial of Historical Figures
Under a new government, it is deemed "worthy" to bury Lenin, and all those currently interred in the Kremlin wall should be moved to a single cemetery for statesmen of the Soviet and post-Soviet eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:57">[09:46:57]</a>. This should be done with state honors, as befits civilized people, to "put an end to this story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:04">[10:14:04]</a>.

## Regional Autonomy and Equality
The speaker believes that Russia should become a true federation, rather than just in name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:06">[03:40:06]</a>. This would involve expanding the financial and economic powers of regions, ensuring that all regions, including those predominantly Russian, have the same rights, opportunities, and powers as the republics within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:04">[03:47:04]</a>. No region or republic should have more powers than another; "all animals should be equal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:44">[03:23:44]</a>.

## Separation of Church and State
The speaker and colleagues support a "real separation of church and state" in [[internal_reforms_and_future_of_russian_governance | future Russian governance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:04">[03:57:04]</a>. They anticipate that the serious political perturbations in Russia will inevitably cause significant changes within the Orthodox Church itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:08">[04:16:08]</a>.

## Pension Reform
In a new Russia, a pension reform is considered "absolutely necessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:04">[02:14:04]</a>. This reform would involve returning the retirement age to its previous indicator (before the so-called pension reform) and establishing special pension accounts for each citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:22">[02:18:22]</a>. If a person does not live to retirement age, their pension savings would be transferred to their relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:04">[02:34:04]</a>.

## Scientific and International Cooperation
After the cessation of armed conflict, economic, scientific, and cultural ties between Russia, Europe, North America, and Japan are expected to be restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:04">[03:37:04]</a>. This process will take years, not months, but is not expected to take decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:04">[03:43:04]</a>. The Russian Academy of Sciences is noted as a "degrading system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:04">[03:20:04]</a>, and while a clear idea for its reform is not yet available, an organization with similar functions would be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:04">[03:42:04]</a>.

## Political Landscape and Succession
The speaker is confident that none of the current candidates for the presidency, whether from the government or opposition, will become president after Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:04">[03:00:04]</a>. A "completely different person" is expected to take power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:04">[03:13:04]</a>. The political elite's need to survive after Putin will eventually break loyalties and even long-standing friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:04">[02:51:04]</a>.

> "Victory will be ours it will certainly be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:04">[04:37:04]</a>.

[[future_of_russian_government_legal_reforms_and_political_prisoners | Further political changes]] are anticipated, driven by internal survival instincts within Russia's elite, rather than external factors like the International Criminal Court warrant for Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:04">[02:51:04]</a>. The speaker asserts that Russia will not pursue imperial status again and will focus solely on its own country and people, refraining from interfering with neighbors like Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:04">[01:52:04]</a>. The current military conflict is seen as the "angling exhalation of a country that tried to return to imperial status" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:04">[02:46:04]</a>.

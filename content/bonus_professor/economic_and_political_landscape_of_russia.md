From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The current [[political_situation_in_Russia | political situation in Russia]] and its [[economic_conditions_in_russia | economic conditions]] are subjects of significant discussion, with predictions of major societal shifts and leadership changes in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

## Predictions for the Near Future
A team, of which the speaker is a member, anticipates the initiation of trials against individuals who have committed crimes against humanity, society, their people, and country as early as next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. These "great events" are expected to begin soon, initially imperceptibly, but quickly becoming evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## Putin's Succession and Doubles
The physical death of Putin is anticipated before the end of autumn, possibly even sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. Efforts will likely be made to conceal this death, but such concealment is expected to be short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Once news of the physical death, not political death, reaches society and the elite—including regional leadership—a shift and movement will begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

It is suggested that after Putin's death, there will be a period of short-term stability followed by a plunge into chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. Efforts are planned to make this chaos short-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

### The Role of Doubles
The West and China are reportedly aware that a double is being used to impersonate Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42:00">[20:42:00]</a>, with China even ready to host a double for a visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>. There is an expectation among some that the double could potentially serve as the primary leader for a period, even running in the March presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. However, a significant conflict is noted among elite groups regarding how to implement Putin's rule, a conflict serious enough to lead to inevitable clashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. This internal struggle is expected to lead to the public disclosure of information about Putin's death and the use of doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.

The motivation behind hiding Putin's real birth date is attributed to his fear that those with this information could create a natal chart to predict his death or influence him through magical practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:39:00">[29:39:00]</a>.

The double himself is said to be aware of the danger to his life but hopes to navigate the situation, having been promised freedom and "fabulous" compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:00">[31:13:00]</a>. The Federal Protective Service, specifically the presidential security service, is identified as controlling the "performance" of the double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:32:00">[33:32:00]</a>.

### Post-Putin Scenario
It is believed that many people will regret Putin's departure, fearing instability, which may become the prevailing mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>. However, the authorities are expected to initially try to protect society from this instability by concealing information about his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:00">[25:06:00]</a>.

The period following Putin's death is anticipated to bring changes that will "far exceed" those of the 1990s in scale and consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:00">[29:06:00]</a>.

## Economic Conditions and Corruption
Russia is currently experiencing signs of an [[economic_conditions_in_russia | economic crisis]], including ruble devaluation, inflation, and general economic instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. It is asserted that a colossal amount of money, specifically 4 trillion US dollars, has been withdrawn from Russia as profit from the sale of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. This sum, it is argued, could have transformed the country into an "earthly Paradise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

The support for Putin during his first decade or twelve years in power is attributed to "rational reasons," including generally good and sustainable [[economic_conditions_in_russia | economic growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.

## Key Figures and Groups
### Prigozhin
It is claimed that Prigozhin is alive, well, and at large, currently located in Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. The FBI's order for his arrest has not been cancelled, and intelligence agencies are aware of his status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. Prigozhin reportedly intends to reappear soon after Putin's death and disclose significant information, including details about the Russian president's doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. His future influence is an open question, as he is expected to join an alliance rather than act independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.

### Political Landscape and Elite Power Dynamics
The positions of the Putin family within the elites are said to be weakening, which is considered natural as the head of the family is leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>. A member of his family is reportedly planning to leave Russia for abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>.

Roman Abramovich is noted for his role as an intermediary in negotiations between conflicting parties, associated with influential figures like Chemezov, the head of Rostekhnologii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. However, his intermediary efforts are "categorically unacceptable" to a significant portion of the Russian elite, especially those currently holding the strongest positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.

The "Kiriyenko group" is stated to not exist, thus having no chance to seize power, despite Sergey Kiriyenko being a "brilliant technologist" and "skilled administrator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>. Surkov is also said to have no influence and no longer decides anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:00">[25:56:00]</a>.

After Putin's death, nothing good awaits Shoigu and Peskov, as Shoigu reportedly lacks influence in the armed forces and will be unable to play an independent role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:41:00">[33:41:00]</a>.

## Political System and Governance
The suggestion of completely withdrawing government agencies from the Kremlin and converting it into a museum complex is supported, with the belief that this will eventually be done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

The West is depicted as willing to deal with a double or a new dictator, prioritizing its own interests such as maintaining [[political_and_economic_conditions_in_russia | political stability]] in Russia and control over the nuclear arsenal, rather than concern for Russian citizens' freedom or [[economic_conditions_in_russia | economic conditions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>. For China, the interest lies in maintaining Russia's [[economic_conditions_in_russia | economic dependence]] to secure raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>. This policy is described as "hypocritical and two-faced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>.

In the event of severe crisis after Putin's departure, Russia will have a chance to embark on a path of "correct, free, competitive, and competitive development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:53:00">[21:53:00]</a>.

### Political Views and Values
The speaker identifies as a liberal conservative or conservative liberal, emphasizing moral and cultural values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. These include support for traditional family, traditional human relations, decency, honesty, and the importance of individual liberation for the family's benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. Competition is deemed "necessary and absolutely necessary," contrasting with the lack of competition seen during the last 20 years and over 70 years of Soviet rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>. The speaker also identifies as a populist, stating a strong connection and presence with the Russian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

### Freedom of Speech and Future Constitution
Regarding freedom of speech, a preference for the American model over the European one (with more restrictions) is expressed, though acknowledging that society and those in power will ultimately decide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:00">[26:31:00]</a>. The adoption of a new constitution, possibly through a referendum, is foreseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:00">[26:55:00]</a>.

### Administrative-Territorial Structure
The speaker advocates for transforming Russia from a nominal federation into an actual one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>. The first necessary step in this direction is the granting of increased budgetary independence to the regions of the Russian Federation, which is seen as the foundation for building federalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:22:00">[30:22:00]</a>.

## Other Relevant Issues
### Mobilization
While the threat of mobilization has reportedly weakened, the risk has not disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:38:00">[27:38:00]</a>. Mobilization could be declared for political reasons, serving as a disciplinary measure to control the populace, rather than purely military necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03:00">[28:03:00]</a>.

### International Relations
The Kremlin is accused of "adding fuel to the fire" of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. The recent events in Israel are not expected to escalate into a third world war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>, nor are they expected to directly bring about the end of the special military operation in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:07:00">[33:07:00]</a>.

The concept of a "World government imposing global agendas" is dismissed as non-existent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

### Environmental Issues
A solution to the country's environmental problems is stated to be part of the proposed program, though specific details are not disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:09:00">[26:09:00]</a>.

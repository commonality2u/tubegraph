The current global situation is described as being close to or even repeating the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This assessment stems from a combination of economic warfare and explicit threats involving [[potential_use_of_nuclear_weapons | nuclear weapons]].

## Economic Warfare and Russian Vulnerability

Official Russian figures, including Press Secretary Peskov, have stated that certain economic sanctions would be perceived as a declaration of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. The West has openly acknowledged waging an economic war against the Russian Federation, inflicting severe blows on the Russian economy and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

The Russian ruble's depreciation and the overall state of the Russian economy demonstrate its weakness and dependence on external relations, particularly economic ties with Europe and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. The West has made it clear that it will not stop increasing pressure, even if it incurs economic losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. This escalating pressure, combined with ongoing military operations in Ukraine, poses a dangerous impact on the Russian economy, potentially leading to very serious socio-political consequences, including mass protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

In response to these pressures, the Kremlin reportedly believes that an effective way to halt the economic war is to threaten with [[potential_use_of_nuclear_weapons | nuclear weapons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This could involve demonstrating tactical nuclear weapons on a limited scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. The Kremlin also thinks that [[risks_of_escalation_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction | nuclear blackmail]] could achieve significant concessions, aligning with the ultimatum presented to [[international_relations_and_military_aid_involving_nato_and_iran | NATO]] and Ukraine in December of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

A notable quote from President Putin, "They will all die, and we will go to heaven," suggests a readiness among the ruling Russian elite to engage in such actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. However, the speaker notes that this elite likely possesses first-class shelters, implying they do not intend to "go to heaven" themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

## International Response to Nuclear Threats

American partners are reportedly taking the potential threat of a nuclear exchange "extremely serious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. As a measure to avoid provocation, they have cancelled training firings of intercontinental ballistic missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

Recent intelligence briefings in the US Congress have focused significantly on the mental state of the President of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. These briefings are believed to provide answers to questions regarding the start of the military operation against Ukraine and the [[potential_use_of_nuclear_weapons | possibility of Russia using nuclear weapons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

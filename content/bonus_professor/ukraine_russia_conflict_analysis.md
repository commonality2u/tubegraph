## Current State of the [[ongoing_armed_confrontation_between_russia_and_ukraine | Conflict]]

The [[ongoing_armed_ Confrontation between Russia and Ukraine | special military operation]] has entered a positional phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This phase is characterized by positional skirmishes with little advancement and long, stubborn battles for populated areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It does not resemble large-scale operations like those seen in 1943, such as tank breakthroughs, cauldrons, or envelopments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Both sides retain the intention of achieving a strategic turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Ukraine's intention for a turning point is strongly supported by its Western allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Ukraine is not expected to have a shortage of military and technical resources, with an uninterrupted supply line largely in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The question for Ukraine is also about moral and psychological resources, as well as society's ability to bear the burdens of the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | conflict]] and the armed forces' capacity to resist skillfully and potentially counter-offend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Russian military policy towards Ukraine aimed to knock out Ukraine's resources and demoralize Ukrainian society to force a peace treaty on Russia's terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. However, resources continue to flow into Ukraine faster than Russia can deplete them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The Russian goal has not been achieved, and a strategic turning point remains as distant as it was at the beginning of the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Shifting Russian Objectives and Resource Limitations

Unlike Ukraine, Russia has limited military resources, and no other nation intends to provide it with military assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. There are many questions regarding the moral-political and moral-psychological state of the Russian armed forces and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. A fundamental question is the actual goal of the operation, as these goals have been rewritten multiple times over the past two and a half months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

Initially, the goal was the "denazification" and "demilitarization" of Ukraine, implying complete political control and a change of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Now, a more modest task is set: complete control of Donbas and apparently control of the Azov coast and the Black Sea coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Control of the Azov coast has been more or less achieved, but implementation for the Black Sea coast has not even begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This is considered a maximum task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Some high-ranking Russian military leaders, particularly a General Staff General, doubt that even the limited goals of this second stage of the special operation can be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## The Prospect of Mobilization in Russia

To achieve a strategic turning point, two tools are considered: crushing Ukraine's armed forces with human mass through mobilization, or inflicting tactical nuclear strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

The topic of mobilization has not only entered the agenda but has become key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Discussions and preparations for mobilization have been ongoing practically since the first day of the [[ongoing_armed_confrontation_between_russia_and_ukraine | special military operation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The Security Council, specifically Nikolai Patrushev, has reported to Putin that from an organizational and technical perspective, everything is ready for mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. They also believe that mass mobilization will not entail negative political consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

A decision regarding mobilization has been made by the President of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. However, it is not certain it will be implemented, and the timing is not yet designated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. May 9th was discussed but was only one of several options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

It is planned to mobilize about half a million people in several stages (3-4 stages), though it might end after the first, depending on the mass reaction, including political <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Tools for motivation include military registration and enlistment office employees coming to homes, blocking bank cards of those subject to mobilization, and closing borders for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Anyone with a military ID between 17 and 50 is theoretically subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### Justification for Mobilization

Mobilization must be preceded by events that, from a propaganda perspective, justify its need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. These actions would show that Ukraine poses an existential threat to the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Such events could include a chemical attack or terrorist attacks in large Russian cities, including Moscow and St. Petersburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. These could serve as a pretext to publicly declare that the homeland is in danger, transitioning the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | conflict]] from a special military operation to a full-fledged, large-scale war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## The Possibility of Tactical Nuclear Weapons Use

Such a declaration of war would also legitimize the possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. If Ukraine is presented as an "existential threat" to the Russian Federation, the Kremlin could argue that this threat must be destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. The analyst cautions that events previously deemed "impossible" (like the start of the [[ongoing_armed_confrontation_between_russia_and_ukraine | conflict]] on February 24) did happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

## Mindset of Russian Leadership

The logic guiding Vladimir Putin is fundamentally different from that of external experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Putin is described as very rational within his own worldview and relying on premises that may seem strange to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. His views on history have significantly influenced political decision-making in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

The same people who previously argued that a [[russia_ukraine_conflict | conflict]] with Ukraine was impossible based on its unprofitability for Putin are now arguing against mobilization using similar reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

There are psychological symptoms indicating that things are not going well within the Russian leadership, characterized by "hysterical statements" and an atmosphere of despair and anger at both the top and bottom levels of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. The forms of thinking within the decision-making apparatus are not clear to external observers but possess colossal power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Those close to the decision-makers either do not want to stop them, are afraid, or cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

### Preventing Mobilization

The chances of preventing mobilization are slim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Theoretically, if public sentiment expressed through critical discussion of mobilization's necessity reaches Putin via Federal Security Service reports, he might become aware of negative disposition among people who do not want to mobilize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Failing that, individual strategies for salvation are the realistic alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

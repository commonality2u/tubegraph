The campaign to recruit contract soldiers for the Russian armed forces is reportedly failing, particularly in large cities like Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This failure is significant in light of an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive and potential serious losses on both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. To compensate for these expected losses, the Russian armed forces will likely demand additional personnel, which, if contract soldiers are insufficient, can only be achieved through a mobilization process, even if it's not officially termed "mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Legal Amendments to Facilitate Mobilization

On April 11, significant legal amendments were introduced to formalize the legal status and consequences of mobilization, impacting the unified register of persons liable for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Key Changes to Summons and Reporting

*   **Electronic Summonses:** Electronic summonses are now legally equivalent to paper ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Automatic Receipt:** An electronic summons is considered automatically received the moment it is posted in the personal account of the person liable for military service on public services platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Broad Application:** This rule applies to all persons liable for military service, not just conscripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. While an explanation states this rule does not apply to the spring draft, it *does* apply to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### [[restrictive_measures_for_russian_military_draft_dodgers | Restrictive Measures for Draft Dodgers]]

The new amendments expand [[restrictive_measures_for_russian_military_draft_dodgers | restrictive measures]] for draft dodgers, affecting all individuals liable for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. These penalties are designed to compel individuals to appear for military service if they receive a summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

If a person does not appear voluntarily within two weeks of receiving an electronic summons (which is digitally signed by the military commissar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>), they will face a number of restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>:

*   **Travel Ban:** Restriction on leaving the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Driving Ban:** Prohibition from driving vehicles, effectively canceling their driver's license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Real Estate Restrictions:** Inability to engage in real estate transactions, such as buying or selling an apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Business Restrictions:** Inability to register as an individual entrepreneur and, implicitly, a ban on engaging in economic activity as an individual entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Loan Ban:** Prohibition from taking out loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Bank Account Freezing:** Anticipated blocking of bank accounts, though this point may not be explicitly in the current amendments, it is expected to be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

These measures could potentially affect over 20 million citizens, with some estimates suggesting up to 27 million people could be mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. A database for non-departure already contains over 14 million people, some for reasons unrelated to mobilization, such as unpaid alimony or loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Personal Choices and Preparations

Individuals are presented with a dilemma regarding their perceived duty: either fulfilling a "patriotic duty" by entering a foreign country where they are not invited and risking death or serious injury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, or prioritizing their duty to themselves, their family, and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The speaker cautions against believing promises of financial support for demobilized individuals or care for their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

For those considering ways to mitigate potential negative consequences:

*   **Public Services Account:** Consider closing one's public services account to avoid receiving electronic summonses, as summonses will not be sent if there is no account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This should be done calmly, not feverishly, as there is some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Asset Transfer:** General powers of attorney, which were useful during the last partial mobilization, are unlikely to work now due to the restrictions on personal rights regarding transactions and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Therefore, individuals may need to consider transferring ownership rights of their car or property to very reliable and trusted individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This involves significant risks and should be done only after consulting with experienced lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Contingency Planning:** It is advised to stay calm and prepare multiple contingency plans for a "critical decision" regarding mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. These plans should be discussed with family and friends, and arrangements for mutual assistance should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

Despite these alarming developments, the speaker maintains a hopeful outlook, stating that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

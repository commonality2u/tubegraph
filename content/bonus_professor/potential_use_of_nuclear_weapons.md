The discussion regarding the possibility of [[potential_future_mobilization_and_military_strategies | mobilization]] in the Russian Federation also touches upon the potential use of nuclear weapons. This is presented as a drastic measure considered in the context of the ongoing special military operation in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Rationale for Considering Nuclear Strikes

In a situation where a strategic turning point is not being achieved by the Russian Federation, two primary tools are considered to try and achieve one:
1.  Mass mobilization of human resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
2.  Inflicting tactical nuclear strikes on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

The speaker notes that if mass mobilization does not help, or if Ukraine itself begins to achieve a strategic turning point in its favor, the latter option might be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Legitimizing Nuclear Use

The transfer of the conflict's status from a "special military operation" to a full-fledged and large-scale war would simultaneously legitimize the possibility of using [[risks_of_escalation_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction | tactical nuclear weapons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. The argument for this would be based on the claim that Ukraine or "Ukrainian Nazis and Banderites" pose an "existential threat" to the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. The Kremlin's hypothetical stance is that such a threat "must be destroyed," and the world would "thank us for ridding it of this threat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

## Skepticism and Reality

Despite common perceptions that the use of [[risks_of_escalation_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction | weapons of mass destruction]] seems "implausible" or "cannot be," the speaker draws a parallel to the start of the conflict on February 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. Those who claimed the conflict was impossible, deeming it illogical or unprofitable for Putin, were proven wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The speaker argues that the logic guiding Vladimir Putin is fundamentally different from that of external observers and experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

> "Why do you think that nuclear strikes cannot happen, even with tactical warheads? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a> Accept that there are other forms of thinking next to us. These forms of thinking are not very clear to us. But the most important and saddest thing for us is that these forms of thinking have colossal power. I mean, in terms of decision-making." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>

This perspective suggests that the decision-makers operate within a worldview and based on premises that may seem strange or irrational to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The speaker highlights that those in power, even if they internally disagree, may be afraid or unable to stop decisions, drawing a comparison to World War II generals who continued to carry out orders they considered "mad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

## Broader Context of Russian Policy

The speaker points to "hysterical statements" and "despair and anger" observed within the Russian Federation's atmosphere, not only among the populace but also at the top levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. This emotional state could influence further decision-making. The [[the_implications_of_nuclear_weapons_policy | implications of nuclear weapons policy]] and [[nuclear_threat_and_international_tensions | nuclear threat and international tensions]] are thus framed within a context of perceived political and strategic desperation.

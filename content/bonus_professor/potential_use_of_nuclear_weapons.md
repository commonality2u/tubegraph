The prospect of [[potential_use_of_weapons_of_mass_destruction | nuclear weapons]] being used has become a significant concern in current geopolitical discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. It is suggested that the world may be closer to the possibility of [[discussion_of_nuclear_weapons_usage | using nuclear weapons]] than at any point since the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>.

## Western Stance and Threats
The West's position, as articulated at the Munich Conference, emphasizes that no [[nuclear_threats_and_economic_sanctions | threats from Putin and Russia]], including the [[discussion_of_nuclear_weapons_usage | threat of using nuclear weapons]], will deter them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Even if the perceived threat of using such a weapon is considered low (e.g., two to three percent), this risk is deemed "colossal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.

## Psychological Readiness of Leadership
Sources suggest that Putin is "psychologically morally ready" for the potential use of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. However, there is hope that he might be unable to implement such a decision, even if an order were given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.

## International Warnings
Chinese officials, including at the highest level, have reportedly warned against the use of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. Despite these warnings, the West has made it clear that they are "not afraid" of such a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Decision-Making
A potential military defeat for Russia, particularly one leading to the loss of all territorial acquisitions in [[ukraines_future_concerning_nuclear_weapons | Ukraine]], including the peninsula, could pressure Putin to consider radical actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. It is speculated that some are trying to provoke a harsh reaction from Putin, possibly to incite decisive action from his inner circle to prevent "inadequate actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

This article explores the connection between Russia and the Hamas attack, as well as the anticipated effects of the new war in the Middle East on the [[russianukrainian_relations_and_the_prospect_of_war | Russian-Ukrainian confrontation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Russia's Alleged Involvement in Hamas Actions

Based on indirect data and insider information available by Sunday, October 15, Russia was involved in some capacity in Hamas's actions against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This involvement was likely carried out "under a foreign flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Three aspects of this alleged involvement include:
*   Assistance in providing Hamas with sensitive information and help in planning the operation, though its significance is considered unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   Instructors from the Wagner PMC conducted combat and tactical training for Hamas fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. These were specifically Wagner instructors, not Russian General Staff or army servicemen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   Hamas reportedly received weapons, partly from "Russian Rona," potentially through the Wagner PMC. This was possibly done to imply [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]]'s involvement in the attack through a leak of weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Reasons for Russian Involvement

The Russian Federation's reasons for this involvement are twofold and complementary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>:
1.  **Opening a Second Front**: The primary objective is to divert Western attention away from [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
2.  **Putin's Personal Revenge**: A less obvious reason suggests that Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to take revenge on Israel. This stems from March-April 2023, when Israeli doctors, who had supervised his cancer treatment since 2020 and operated on him in February, declared they would no longer be involved in his treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Impact on [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukrainian-Russian Confrontation]]

The Middle East war has a significant impact on the [[ukraine_russia_conflict_and_strategic_turning_points | Russian-Ukrainian armed confrontation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### Shift in Media Focus
*   [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]] has largely fallen out of the focus of global media attention, particularly since October 6-7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   Major American and Western media outlets have reduced their online coverage of military actions in [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. For example, a BBC news hour on a Saturday in London reportedly made no mention of [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   The principle "where attention is directed, there energy appears" applies to the situation around [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Russian-Ukrainian relations]], implying a reduction in external support or engagement for [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   It is difficult to imagine the conditions under which [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]] will return to the long-term focus of global media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This shift in media attention is crucial as global media shapes the information agenda and determines societal focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Allocation of Aid
*   While the United States has stated it possesses sufficient resources to aid both Israel and [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]] simultaneously, particularly financial resources, the situation regarding weapons and ammunition is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   The supply of weapons and ammunition becomes a matter of choosing priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   It is clear that Israel will be the priority recipient of military aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. The longer the Middle East war lasts, the more acute this problem of choosing priorities for weapon and ammunition supplies will become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Decline in Western Aid to [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]]
*   Western aid to [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]] reached its peak in the summer and early autumn of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   This aid is now expected to decrease for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>:
    1.  The emergence of a new theater of military operations in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
    2.  The [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukrainian]] offensive failed to achieve its strategic goals, despite some positional successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. It is unlikely to achieve these goals this season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

### Stalemate in the [[current_phase_of_the_russian_ukraine_conflict | Russian-Ukrainian Conflict]]
*   The [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukrainian]] autumn offensive is in its final phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   Russian attempts at a counteroffensive in the Avdiivka and Kupyansk directions have also not been impressive and have resulted in significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   The most probable outcome for the summer-autumn campaigns is a transition to mutual strategic defense, characterized by Western experts as a stalemate or dead end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   This strategic dead end appears to be complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. While military actions are unpredictable, the current observation is a stalemate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.
*   A strategic dead end is unlikely to benefit [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]], but the Russian leadership may be satisfied with it, as it preserves the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

### Internal Russian Focus
*   For the Russian military-political leadership, the internal situation has taken precedence, particularly the resolution of the "Supreme Authority" issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This is not about presidential elections, which are merely a formality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   The current president, Vladimir Putin, is described as "living out the last days of his earthly life," being successfully replaced by a double named "Vasilich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   The highest layer of the Russian elite, approximately 50 people, cannot achieve a consensus on power transition without Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Putin's departure would lead to instability and the eventual destruction of the system he created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Russia is entering a period of "highest turbulence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

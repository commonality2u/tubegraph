## Assassination Attempt on Donald Trump

An [[assassination_attempt_on_president_putin | attempt]] was made on the life of US presidential candidate Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This incident occurred on Saturday, July 13, at the time of a rally in Pennsylvania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The speaker refrained from speculating on the perpetrator, noting a lack of information to determine if it was the work of a lone wolf, an organization, or a deliberate hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Despite the lack of immediate information, it is believed with a high probability that this [[assassination_attempt_on_president_putin | assassination attempt]], during which Trump was "saved literally by a miracle," will play a decisive role in his bid for the presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. While theoretically he could still lose, the chances of this are considered small, and the likelihood of him becoming the new president prevails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Assassination Attempts on Vladimir Putin

The head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Budanov, stated that Ukrainian intelligence made several unsuccessful attempts to [[assassination_attempt_on_president_putin | assassinate]] [[president_putins_actions_and_intentsion | President Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Budanov is reportedly declared an extremist and terrorist in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Pre-February 2022 Security

Prior to February 24, 2015, no attempts to [[assassination_attempt_on_president_putin | assassinate]] [[president_putins_actions_and_intentsion | President Putin]] (while he was alive) even reached the stage of organizational preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Discussions about a possible [[assassination_attempt_on_president_putin | assassination attempt]] on [[president_putins_actions_and_intentsion | President Putin]] only occurred at the conversational level until February 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. During this period, [[president_putins_actions_and_intentsion | President Putin]] was considered one of, if not the most, protected person in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Post-February 2022 Landscape

After February 2022, the idea of [[assassination_attempt_on_president_putin | assassinating]] the Russian president naturally arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, just as the Russian military-political leadership considered [[assassination_attempt_on_president_putin | assassinating]] the Ukrainian president, Zelensky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The Russian leadership initially expected Zelensky to leave Ukraine and hide in Poland or western Ukraine, leading to a hunt for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This hunt was unsuccessful, though later in the current year, missiles were fired at locations where Zelensky was present, leading to a purge within Ukraine's State Security Service due to Russian intelligence moles in Zelensky's inner circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. However, these attempts against Zelensky did not succeed, largely due to the highly professional work of Zelensky's security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

Ukrainians believed that if it were possible to eliminate [[president_putins_actions_and_intentsion | Putin]], military actions might cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. However, the speaker expresses no doubt that, even after February 2022, attempts against [[president_putins_actions_and_intentsion | Putin]] (or his alleged replacement, "the late [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death_and_replacement | Putin]]") did not reach the organizational stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

> "Security in this case now the person who replaces the late [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death_and_replacement | Putin]] is being guarded in the same way as the late president that his the importance is very great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>

The [[security_and_risk_concerns_for_putin | security]] for the person who has replaced [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death_and_replacement | the late Putin]] is organized "first class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The speaker implies that this level of [[security_and_risk_concerns_for_putin | security]] makes it unlikely for [[assassination_attempt_on_president_putin | attempts]] to reach an organizational stage even after February 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Speculations on Putin's Status and Successors

The speaker frequently refers to [[president_putins_actions_and_intentsion | Putin]] as "the late [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death_and_replacement | President Putin]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> and mentions "the person who replaces the late [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death_and_replacement | Putin]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This replacement is guarded in the same way as the "late president," indicating significant importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The speaker hints at the concept of "twinning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, possibly referring to [[allegations_of_putins_double | allegations of Putin's double]] or a successor embodying his role. If this "Vasil" (likely a mispronunciation or informal reference to a core figure) were to cease, "the whole structure of the Russian government is flying to the smart and flying with a whistle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

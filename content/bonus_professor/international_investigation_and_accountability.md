From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

On February 16, 2024, an emergency broadcast discussed the news of Alexei Navalny's death, or rather, his suspected killing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The speaker, Valery, expressed condolences to Navalny's family, friends, and sympathizers, acknowledging his inclusion on a list of terrorists and extremists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Navalny was praised for his "amazing quality" of commitment to his goals and objectives as a politician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Suspected Political Murder

The speaker stated an inclination towards the version of Navalny's death being a political murder rather than a natural one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This belief persists even if it were a natural death, as the Kremlin had reportedly been "creating all sorts of impossible conditions for the past few years" to "freeze Alexei," with years of imprisonment and nearly a year in a punishment cell designed to critically impact his health and psyche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Indirect Signs of Political Murder

Several indirect signs are cited as evidence supporting the theory of political murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>:
*   A very quick, unanimous reaction from the Russian official media, reporting the news "on command" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   An unusually quick reaction from Peskov for such a case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   At least two or three assassination attempts on "dangerous and important opponents of that elite group that is now laying claim to full power in Russia" in the month prior to Navalny's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. These attempts were fortunately unsuccessful for the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Anticipated Official Narrative and Counterarguments

The speaker anticipates "cynical lies and real nonsense" from official sources regarding the circumstances of Navalny's death, which they firmly believe was a murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Expected narratives include:
*   Navalny is alive and well abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   The West sacrificed him to compromise the so-called presidential elections or to "blur the effect" of Putin's interview with American journalist Carlson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This is described as a "blurring" tactic in PR jargon, aimed at distracting attention from the essence of what is happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   The claim that Navalny's death was "categorically unprofitable for the Kremlin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

The speaker refutes the "unprofitable" argument, drawing parallels to the murder of Nemtsov, the poisoning of Navalny, and the start of the [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | Russian military operation against Ukraine]], all of which were similarly claimed to be unprofitable but, in hindsight, were considered logical and consistent actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Instead, it is argued that Navalny's death was "profitable, it is logical, it is consistent" for an elite group seeking "full power in Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This group, possibly the same individuals behind the earlier poisoning attempt, aimed to "remove any risks, remove any threats on the eve of the so-called presidential elections and, most importantly, on the eve of the transfer of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. They want to "get rid of the slightest risks now, squeeze out all the grass, cement all the fields where this grass may appear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## Call for International Investigation and Accountability

To counter "slander, real or apparent, against the Kremlin," the speaker states that the authorities could easily refute accusations by doing one thing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>:

> [00:08:01] For this, it is necessary to invite international experts from Western experts from unfriendly Mania, remember, it was in Germany that they diagnosed it Let's Let the Kremlin invite Western experts, German ones Let them conduct an international public examination, finally conduct it publicly Let them give the body to the family of the deceased, his relatives and friends Let the family dispose of the body, not the Kremlin, they, the Federal Penitentiary Service, dispose of the body of Alexei Navalny, and if this government does everything Well, then it will probably check No Those natural suspicions, natural suspicions, are very softly formulated in its address, which I have now announced to you

## Lessons and Warnings for the Future

The speaker emphasized the "colossal political potential" of Alexei Navalny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. A key lesson to be learned from his death is the need to appreciate living activists:

> [00:09:28] for some reason only the dead they only know how to love the dead but not the living remember What slander was poured on Navalny when he was alive when he was free even when he was in prison and in this they suspected a cunningly conceived game dear friends Let's try to love those who are alive who are free may not be free in prison believe me Our love now and respect and kind words and the main help and support that we listen to

The speaker warns that Navalny's death is "only the beginning" and that other Russian oppositionists, both inside and outside Russia, are now under threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The year 2024 is predicted to be "tragic" and potentially the "hardest year in our entire life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. In this difficult time, the speaker advises taking care of one's health, family, and friends, as they are "the key to our stability and the key and conditions for our survival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Despite the tragic outlook, a message of hope and confidence is conveyed: "everything will change for the better and will begin to change already in this 2024" and "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

## The Oligarchy Under Sanctions

The stream, titled "The Last Chance for the Oligarchs," addresses the pressures on the [[russian_elites_and_their_interaction_with_western_organizations | Russian oligarchy]] following recent events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The US has sanctioned "practically all the main figures" of the [[russian_elites_and_their_interaction_with_western_organizations | Russian oligarchy]], including Usmanov, Mordashov, Temchenko, and Berg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Despite these widespread American sanctions, some oligarchs are perceived to have "some leeway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Usmanov's sanctions, for instance, don't freeze all his companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Abramovich, not formally sanctioned by the US, is attempting to resolve his situation, reportedly spending hundreds of millions of pounds to avoid sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:03:04]</a>. The freezing of assets and inability to enter Europe or Great Britain significantly complicate personal and business situations for these individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

These oligarchs are believed to be given an opportunity to "decide the issue" not with the West, but with [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | Russia]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This implies they must "do something about Putin and the war in Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Abramovich's public statement about his indirect involvement in negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv is seen as a way for him to avoid sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Differentiated Approach by the West
There is a "differentiated approach" by the West towards Russian oligarchs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Group 1 (Seasoned)**: Individuals like Timchenko, Rotenberg, and Kovalchuk face merciless sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Arkady Rotenberg, for example, previously engaged in consultations with Western intelligence agencies regarding [[russian_political_leadership_transitions_and_internal_power_dynamics | liberal changes in Russia]], but this track proved fruitless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Group 2 (Attempting to Deal)**: The second group, including Usmanov and Abramovich, are offered "more lenient regimes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:17]</a>. While Usmanov's personal assets in Britain have been confiscated, his business entities are not sanctioned, indicating a potential for resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:48]</a>. The West anticipates that these individuals, who were once close to Putin, might exert influence on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:07:08]</a>.

### Putin's Relationship with the Elites
For the past two years, many oligarchs are no longer "close to the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Those who can still meet him belong to the first category, such as Kovalchuk, Rotenberg, and Temchenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:08:02]</a>. Others, like Sobyanin or Valentin Yumashev (a figure embodying the "old Yeltsin elite" who facilitated Putin's rise), cannot meet him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:09:00]</a>.

A "non-aggression pact" seems to exist between the old elite and the government: the elite doesn't attack, finance opposition, or engage in "investing," and Putin doesn't "touch" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:14]</a>. However, these oligarchs lack direct access to Putin and cannot influence him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:22]</a>. The idea that they could conspire with generals to stop Putin is dismissed as unrealistic, as Putin's security apparatus prevents any such penetration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:46]</a>.

### Limited Influence of Oligarchs
Currently, oligarchs and large private businesses are largely "helpless" in political terms despite their immense wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:28]</a>. They lack the means for political action or influence through political technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:45]</a>. Any elite action, like a conspiracy or coup, would only succeed if synchronized with a "movement from below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:35]</a>. However, current conditions make this impossible due to the absence of independent media, public opinion leaders, and the ability to organize street protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:13:43]</a>. The suppression of information means people are unwilling to hear about war losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:38]</a>.

The West's strategy, however, appears to be "working for the future" by increasing pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:53]</a>. The logical next step after oligarchs would be officials, targeting their families and assets abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:23:40]</a>. Sanctions are expected to broaden and deepen, affecting not just the wealthiest, but also a "second row of oligarchs" and extending to family relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:25]</a>.

## [[russian_internal_politics_and_economy | Economic and Social Consequences]]

The current situation is likened to an "economic war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:31]</a>. Putin understands this and is preparing an "asymmetric response," evidenced by nuclear forces being put on high alert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:45]</a>.

The [[russian_internal_politics_and_economy | Russian economy]] is expected to deteriorate sharply and spasmodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:52]</a>. Banks raising deposit rates are seen as a desperate measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:03]</a>, with anticipated inflation rates potentially reaching 50-60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:11]</a>. People will likely feel the full impact by the end of summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:31]</a>.

For the public, this will manifest as:
*   **Mass Unemployment**: Labor armies or service might be introduced to occupy the unemployed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:38]</a>.
*   **Shortages and Disruptions**: Issues with food, logistics, and critically, medicine provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:15:03]</a>. Consumables for medical equipment like ultrasound and MRI machines are unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   **Return of "Deficit"**: The current generation, who grew up under Putin, will learn the meaning of "deficit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:47]</a>.

### Mobilization and Information Control
Military measures, including mobilization, are anticipated due to Russia using 90% of its selected forces in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:21:08]</a>. This would be a significant public event, potentially involving raids for conscription in cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:34:06]</a>. The government will frame draft dodgers as traitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:31]</a>.

The number of war casualties is seen as a crucial, but currently controlled, factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:49]</a>. The government has taken steps to suppress information by destroying alternative channels and intimidating anyone who might speak out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:30:08]</a>. Compensation of millions of rubles for the dead and wounded is intended to silence people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:33:04]</a>.

### Increasing Repressions
[[Russian internal political dynamics and leadership issues | Repressions]] are intensifying, moving beyond electoral or legal procedures to "blind" mass repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:58]</a>. This includes new articles for "fakes about the war" carrying 15-year sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:49">[00:46:55]</a>.

The targets of these repressions are initially "disloyal" leaders, bloggers, and cultural figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:15">[00:47:24]</a>. Subsequently, those "not loyal enough" or who refuse to "glorify great feats" will be targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:39]</a>. Eventually, the repressions will extend to "mass groups" to intimidate the ordinary people who form Putin's majority, ensuring "total loyalty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:49:45]</a>. This involves identifying and punishing "troublemakers" without principle, even if they are innocent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:28]</a>.

## Exodus and Future Outlook

A significant number of young people and those in intelligent professions are attempting to leave [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:36]</a>. Educational institutions have seen a disappearance of up to half their male students in a week, as they leave the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:42:03]</a>.

Restrictions on leaving are expected to be imposed, especially for conscripts, with the likely introduction of "exit visas" and interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:29]</a>. Currently, people are already being questioned at airports, and their phones are being checked for social media activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:39]</a>. There is also a ban on taking out more than ten thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:51]</a>.

The situation is predicted to worsen, moving towards a "second Caribbean" or nuclear missile crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:36]</a>. Naval forces, including anti-missile ships, are reportedly being deployed by European countries in the Mediterranean, Baltic, and Black Sea to intercept potential missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:18:15]</a>.

A perspective on Putin's actions suggests they may be driven by an "occult" or irrational program rather than purely rational logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:43]</a>. While not rational for an observer, it has an "iron logic" from his perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:06">[00:53:15]</a>. This is reinforced by "shamanic ritual" and advisers who tell him what he wants to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:32">[00:53:41]</a>. Calculations for the current operation were reportedly made by "astrologers" and hired specialists, influencing Putin's belief that "everything comes together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:18]</a>.

The next six months are expected to be "very scary," with the situation getting "worse and worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:53">[00:55:07]</a>.

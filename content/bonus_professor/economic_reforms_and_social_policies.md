This article provides insights into proposed economic and social policy changes in Russia, as well as current challenges and observations on the nation's sociopolitical landscape.

## Clarification Regarding Previous Information

An earlier video mistakenly stated that Tartu airport was closed for a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This was erroneous information, as the idea was discussed but not implemented because flight safety threats were "leveled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Apologies were extended for inadvertently misleading viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Predictions for Political Crisis and Change

The development, content, and results of a political crisis are impossible to predict using existing theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. However, the entry into a political crisis can be foreseen with over 75% accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Active participation from the crisis's beginning offers tangible chances to influence desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The most acute phase, or "peak," is expected to last only a few days, while the crisis itself will span several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Power Dynamics and Coalitions

Influential figures opposing Nikolai Patrushev are no less powerful than he is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Trust and loyalty among allies in a power struggle are uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Power in Russia can blind and hinder rational thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The notion that Patrushev's "tower" holds absolute power is erroneous, as the strength of competing coalitions, such as Chemezov's, is at least equal, if not stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The Prosecutor General's Office and Investigative Committee are expected to side with the winners of any upcoming crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, although they lack armed resources for the acute phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is likely to adopt a position of neutrality, similar to the KGB in 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. The Ministry of Defense will also remain neutral, but the General Staff, particularly its main department, may play a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Proposed Economic and Social Policies After Change of Power

Following a change of power, several [[reforms_and_future_directions_for_russia | reforms]] are envisioned.

### Pension System Adjustments
Individuals who committed crimes, including beating protesters or issuing unlawful sentences, will be prosecuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. All court employees will undergo lustration without exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. While taking away service housing is not certain, lustration is considered sufficient punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. The issue of preferential pensions is under discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Regarding the [[reform_of_the_russian_pension_system | pension system]], the team plans to return to the old retirement age within one to one-and-a-half years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. Those who retired under the newer age (e.g., at 62 or 63) will receive compensation for the money they did not receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>. This is achievable through internal resources and curbing corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

### Minimum Wage and Resource Redistribution
The minimum wage is planned to increase by at least two to three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This will be funded through internal resources, redistribution within the budget, and a significant reduction in theft and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

### Housing Market Reforms
Housing prices, including mortgage costs, are expected to decrease significantly due to rationalization, increased efficiency, and the establishment of order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Currency Outlook
It is advisable to stock up on dollars or euros, as the ruble faces an unfavorable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

### Cryptocurrency and Banking Policies
There are no plans to ban cryptocurrency or crypto exchanges, as Russia is in dire need of their use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. In the event of a financial crisis, monetary authorities are considering limits on cash withdrawals and tighter card limits, though specific restrictions are not yet known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Freezing of deposits is not excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### Combating Corruption: The Gelendzhik Palace Example
The ongoing "construction" of the Gelendzhik palace, despite its initial completion and subsequent demolition for "mold," is cited as a "gigantic theft of budgets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. The primary goal is theft, and who lives in it is irrelevant, as it can be destroyed again if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### Healthcare Support
The team is certain that retirees and those in difficult [[social_and_economic_issues_in_modern_russia | social circumstances]] will receive vital drugs for free or with a significant discount (70-90%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.

### Personal Data Protection
Plans are in place to combat the leakage of personal data, which often originates from government agencies and is protected by interested parties within those agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. The team believes this massive data leak can be stopped and perpetrators punished within three to six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

### Weapons Legislation and Civil Rights
The tightening of weapons legislation in Russia, including the ability to refuse or cancel licenses based on unseen conclusions from the Ministry of Internal Affairs or FSB, is seen as a manifestation of the authorities' fear of armed citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. While society will be in a fragile mental state after military actions, the right to bear arms is expected to be introduced in Russia after some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.

## International Relations and Domestic Concerns

### Potential Conflicts
A hybrid operation planned by the Kremlin against the Baltic countries, particularly Latvia and Estonia, is scheduled for summer-fall of this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. Citizens are advised to follow information from sources like General SVR for updates on this potential conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
A significant number of people (one-third to one-half) experience PTSD after military actions, leading to inadequate and socially dangerous behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. The current Russian authorities are described as unconcerned with this issue, viewing it as a problem for society, not for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.

## Future Governance
The team believes in their victory based on knowledge of the situation and balance of power, as well as "other things" that cannot be disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. The elite war is not expected to escalate into a civil war or the collapse of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. While armed excesses are probable and may be localized in the capital, a large-scale civil war is unlikely due to insufficient conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. A risk of a split or withdrawal of some territories exists, particularly in the North Caucasus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.

The idea of restoring a monarchy is personally considered for the distant future (15-20 years), with a different, extremely limited dynasty serving as a symbol of unity and a guardian of law and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Neither Chemezov nor Patrushev Sr. are believed to desire the presidency, preferring to govern from behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>.

Exercises to close social networks and video hosting were unsuccessful, so YouTube, Telegram, and WhatsApp are not currently planned for blocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

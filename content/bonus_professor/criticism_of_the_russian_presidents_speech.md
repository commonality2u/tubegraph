[[valery_soloveys_analysis_of_vladimir_putins_presidency | Valery Solovey]], on his YouTube channel's 42nd episode of "What's Happening," recorded on December 8th, focuses on responding to the Russian President's speech delivered to the Council on Human Rights and Civil Society Development on December 7th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The speech is analyzed to understand the President's motivations and actions, despite a "huge distance" existing between his words and deeds, a distance that is "constantly increasing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

The Council on Human Rights is described as a "specially selected body" from which "troublemakers" were removed in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The questions posed to the President were pre-approved by the administration and personally by the President, ensuring nothing "uncomfortable and disturbing" could arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Interpretation of the President's State

[[valery_soloveys_analysis_of_vladimir_putins_presidency | Valery Solovey]] summarizes the speech by quoting Fyodor Chistyakov: "What do you want from a sick mind?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. He asserts that "a sick person in this case is not a metaphor and not an exaggeration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The logical inconsistencies found in the President's statements are attributed to a "certain type of thinking" characteristic of people with "certain medical indications," defining their "style of thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Solovey suggests the President "still believes in all this himself" and "ignores" all inconsistencies, as "everything is consistent" in his consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

## Critiques of Specific Statements

### International Doctrine of Human Rights

The President stated that the international doctrine of human rights is used to destroy the sovereignty of states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Solovey questions this, highlighting that this doctrine includes free elections, separation of powers, freedom of movement, and inviolability of personal property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. He argues that these freedoms only threaten a state "the basis of which is the power of criminals, thieves and bandits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### Donbass and "National Interests"

The President claimed that the rights of Donbass residents were violated and they were considered "second-class people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Russia's response, according to the President, is a "consistent struggle for their national interests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Solovey contrasts this with the readiness of Finns to defend their homeland after creating conditions "worth defending" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. He asks what Russia is defending, pointing to:
*   25% of toilets being outdoor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   "Huge territories" that are "emptying and dying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, with the population thinning faster due to the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   "Unfortunate pensioners with tiny pensions" that make a decent lifestyle impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

Solovey challenges the President's claim that Donbass has been "thriving since 2014," stating that "at least one and a half million" people have left, possibly "two million" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. He cites personal knowledge from relatives in Donbass to refute this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### Origin of the War and Russophobia

The President claimed the war was started by Ukrainian authorities in 2014 after a coup d'Ã©tat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Solovey counters this by referencing Igor Strelkov-Girkin, who "said and repeated it many times" that "the war in Donbass began" with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. Solovey states he trusts Strelkov-Girkin's words on this matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

The President's assertion that Russia "only received spit in the face" and that this is "an open form of Russophobia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a> is challenged. Solovey suggests that if protecting Donbass residents was the goal, Russia could have "taken out" millions of people at a cost "several times less than the cost of a special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. He questions why the Supreme Commander-in-Chief did not initiate an operation to protect human rights in Donbass in 2014-2015, when the chances of success were "disproportionately higher than in the spring of 2022" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Poland's Alleged Territorial Ambitions

The President claimed a "nationalist group in Poland" seeks to "take the western territories of Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Solovey dismisses this, comparing it to State Duma deputies demanding the return of Alaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, suggesting such statements are from "marginal groups" or indicate a questionable "mental state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. He points out that Poland has been a major sponsor of Ukraine, providing military and humanitarian aid, and accepting the most Ukrainian citizens who left their country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. No "public and state man of Poland" has voiced "territorial claim to Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

### Russia as Guarantor of Ukraine's Sovereignty

The President claimed Russia is the "only guarantor of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, and that the special military operation was launched for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Solovey highlights the contradiction: "new territories that until recently were parts of Ukraine would be included in Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. He ironically asks how this guarantees "sovereignty and integrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, likening it to Russia's guarantee of Ukraine's security by signing the Budapest Memorandum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### Protecting Russians' Rights and Military Needs

The President emphasized the need to protect the rights of Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. Solovey suggests starting with the rights of the mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. He notes the President's surprise at continued problems with equipment for the mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Solovey points out that problems with rehabilitation for wounded military and civilians, modern prosthetics, drugs, and a rehabilitation system are only "now" being discussed, more than nine months after the operation began on February 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This reveals a lack of "promptness of the response of the Russian authorities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

### Nuclear Weapons Rhetoric

The President stated that Russia's nuclear weapons are "considered only as a means of protection" and only if "we have nothing else left will we defend ourselves by all available means" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Solovey finds this statement "logically very and very contradictory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. He argues that by saying Russia will not use nuclear weapons first, but then stating it would defend itself if nothing else is left, it implies an "ability to deliver the first nuclear strike" under the guise of a "counter retaliatory strike" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This is seen as a "very dangerous statement" that can be interpreted as using nuclear weapons if survival is threatened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

### Prospects of Mobilization

The President claimed that "the conversation about additional mobilization does not make sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Solovey warns that this phrase implies "at the present time" and suggests "very soon we will suddenly discover that these conversations or rather the need for additional mobilization has acquired meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. He states that preparations for "additional recruitment" are underway, with agendas prepared and military commissars awaiting the "go-ahead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Solovey suggests that if the concept of a "people's war" is adopted, "martial law should be declared" and "full mobilization with millions of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. He reminds viewers that the President also promised no pension reform and no rewriting of the Constitution, both of which later occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Solovey advises: "Do not flatter yourself, don't count on it and don't hope that you'll scream at the military registration and enlistment office, 'But the president told you to smile!'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>
> The lack of a decree on the end of partial mobilization is seen as a clear indicator of further plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

### Cost and Impact of the Special Military Operation

The President stated that the special military operation is "designed to last a long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, implying a need for "human resources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Solovey highlights that the operation "absorbs a quarter of the budget of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. This means funds for "new hospitals, pension increases, social payments, increases maternity capital" are instead going to "guns, shells, artillery shots" and military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. He also notes the disappearance of "one and a half million sets of uniforms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a> and the freezing of Russian reserves, with 200 billion dollars unaccounted for, implying they "were stolen before us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

### Internal Issues vs. External Ambitions

Solovey criticizes the President's focus on turning the Sea of Azov into an "inland sea of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a> while basic needs are unmet in Russia. He notes that Russia is the "largest country in the world by area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a> but parts of it are "lying as if in ruins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. Millions of people live without gasification and water, and there's a need to build toilets, with the President having promised a year ago that "all our schools are provided with warm toilets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] "Why do we need someone else's land? What will we get from this? We have nothing of our own above our heads in it, no way can not, can not our hands reach it. Give me hands not minds. We should be proud of the fact that we have put our land in order, and then other lands, other countries and other people will definitely reach out to us because they are drawn there and to those where there is success, where economic prosperity, where the standard of living is growing and not to where violence is exported to other countries." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>

### Additional Payments for Doctors

The President announced additional payments for doctors in primary care starting January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. Solovey suggests this is "very, very insignificant" because a second stage of mobilization is expected to include "300 thousand women," mostly "doctors and medical personnel," meaning those remaining will work "for two for three" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

## Conclusion on the President's Thinking

[[valery_soloveys_analysis_of_vladimir_putins_presidency | Valery Solovey]] reiterates that the President "still believes in all this himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>, and that his "consciousness" makes everything consistent despite "inconsistencies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. Solovey classifies this "type of thinking" as belonging to "medicine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>, echoing the phrase "what do you want from a sick consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. He concludes that "the trouble is that this man runs Russia" in a "bizarre way in which he sees the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>, which is a "grief and misfortune for us not only for us but also for all our neighbors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.

The future of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) and its current leader, Patriarch Kirill, is expected to be significantly impacted by the end of the "special military operation" in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This period is anticipated to coincide with a severe and large-scale [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | political crisis]] in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

During this crisis, all institutions, structures, and individuals holding high positions in the current Russian government are projected to suffer considerably, including the primates of the Russian Orthodox Church, such as Patriarch Kirill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. It is believed that the Church itself will emerge from this crisis "very much suffered and ragged," having lost its "gloss" and "fat" acquired through "alms or rich pasta" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Integration into State Propaganda
The Russian Orthodox Church is deeply integrated into the general propaganda against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This is evident in the discourse of the Primate of the Russian Orthodox Church and his immediate suppression of any priests who attempt to speak out against the armed confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Reaction to Ukrainian Orthodox Church Abolition
The Russian authorities' reaction to the abolition of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate in Ukraine is predictably negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. However, neither the Russian authorities nor the Russian Orthodox Church are capable of any substantive response beyond complaining and groaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. They may try to incorporate this development into the Russian Federation's propaganda discourse, but it proves ineffective, as the Russian populace is generally uninterested in events in Ukraine, unless their close relatives are involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Their primary concerns revolve around their own problems, sorrows, and illnesses, which are unfortunately increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## Influence on Political Decisions
Decisions at the highest levels of Russian government may not always be based on conventional financial, economic, or political sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. For instance, the decision to raise the retirement age was reportedly made after a conversation with a shaman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. The shaman, acting as a "patriarch of tambourine," entered a trance and, communicating with spirits, advised the "Supreme Commander-in-Chief" (also the President of Russia) to proceed with pension reform, stating "everything will be fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This suggests that non-conventional, possibly [[occult_practices_in_russian_politics | occult practices]], may influence significant political decisions in Russia.

## Overview of the Military-Political Week

The military-political week saw the Kremlin unable to achieve a turning point in the special military operation in its favor, a fact clearly noticeable to uncommitted observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The chances of achieving a strategic turning point without the use of extremely potent means are decreasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Kremlin's Strategic Dilemma

The [[Kremlins strategic challenges and alliances | Kremlin]] faces a simple dilemma: either continue the military operation without much chance of success or attempt to negotiate with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. To influence Ukraine into negotiations, it is necessary to work through the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The [[Kremlins strategic challenges and alliances | Kremlin]] is currently sending overt and covert signals to the West regarding the conditions for negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. From the perspective of the initial goals of its special military operation, these goals now appear almost minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Kremlin's Proposed Conditions for a Peace Treaty

The [[Kremlins perception of peace with Ukraine | Kremlin's conditions]] for a peace treaty include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>:
*   Complete control of Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   Ukraine's recognition of Crimea as Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   Recognition of Donbass as independent, or potentially as part of Russia in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   A land corridor to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Attempts at Communication

An overt attempt at communication was a conversation between Russian Defense Minister Shoigu and US Defense Minister Lai Damaskin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This conversation, the first since February 18, occurred only at the direct indication of the highest leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. It was initiated by Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Western and Ukrainian Responses

The West's response to Russia's negotiation requests is largely negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

*   **Differing Western Positions**:
    *   **France and Germany**: Some in these countries would not mind if Russia and Ukraine agreed on such conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. French President Macron reportedly offered Ukrainian President Zelensky to make territorial concessions to Russia for a peace treaty, which Zelensky refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Germany, though not as clear, delays weapon supplies to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
    *   **Anglo-Saxon Bloc (Great Britain, USA, Poland, Baltic countries)**: This bloc's position is simple: "war to a victorious end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

*   **Ukraine's Stance**: Ukraine feels a growing hope of achieving decisive success and completely regaining all its territory, not just restoring the status quo antebellum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The Ukrainian leadership promotes patriotism and optimism in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense declares readiness to mobilize up to a million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Dilemma for the Kremlin

The West, as a collective, desires a swift conclusion to the conflict through a peace treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. However, the [[Kremlin internal political dynamics | Kremlin]] and [[Putins strategy and plans regarding Ukraine | Putin]] cannot leave empty-handed, as this would mean admitting defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. The Russian ambassador to Washington stated there would be "no Moscow's capitulation in Ukraine," a term (capitulation) that has recently appeared in official Russian lexicon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

The West also made it clear to [[Putins strategy and plans regarding Ukraine | Putin]] that it is not interested in an escalation or territorial expansion of the conflict, nor taking it to a qualitatively new level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Russia's Remaining Instruments

Given Ukraine's readiness for mass mobilization and a potential counteroffensive, Russia is left with two instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>:
1.  Mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
2.  The use of qualitatively new, non-conventional weapons, specifically weapons of mass destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

Hidden mobilization is underway in the Russian Federation, drawing from the "mog reserve" created in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. A public announcement of mass mobilization is expected, if at all, after [[Putins strategy and plans regarding Ukraine | Putin's]] upcoming surgery and recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Information Control and Economic Reality

In the absence of military successes, the Russian Ministry of Defense releases sensational news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>:
*   An alleged attempt to infect LPR residents with tuberculosis via fake bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   Reports on Pentagon experiments in a psychiatric hospital in the Kharkov region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
These news items, which quickly die off, serve to occupy the information space in the absence of positive military news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Earlier news about Ukrainian secret laboratories developing dangerous disease strains and studying migratory bird routes also faded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

President [[Putins strategy and plans regarding Ukraine | Putin]] held an economic meeting last week, asserting that Russia is successfully overcoming sanctions, which are to its advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. He claimed the ruble demonstrates the best dynamics globally, while the West faces unemployment, inflation, and falling GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

However, behind this optimism, Bloomberg reports a Ministry of Finance forecast of a 12% GDP fall in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Under a pessimistic scenario, the decline could reach 25% over two years if Russia's isolation from world markets and oil sales continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This would be the most significant decline in 94 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. All economic achievements of the past 10 years are being nullified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Car sales in Russia collapsed by almost 80% in April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, and AvtoVAZ is preparing to offer car models from the early 90s due to a lack of imported components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. Additionally, every fifth company has begun mass layoffs, with another third considering it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

The government attempts to compensate for this deteriorating social and economic situation with injections of optimism and patriotism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This includes introducing history lessons from the first grade and restoring the All-Union Pioneer Organization on May 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. The more talk about patriotism and calls for patience, the worse the real state of affairs in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

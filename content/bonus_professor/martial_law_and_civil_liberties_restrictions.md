Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, in its "Answers to Hot Questions" program, discusses the potential for an escalation of military action in Russia, which is expected to lead to a second stage of [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] and the introduction of [[martial_law_and_its_implications | martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This analysis was recorded on Friday, November 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Expected Escalation and Timing
Following Russian President Vladimir Putin's apparent abandonment of peace negotiations with Ukraine, an escalation of military action is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This escalation is expected to manifest as a second stage of [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] and the introduction of [[martial_law_and_its_implications | martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

It is highly probable that the second stage of [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] will be announced after the New Year holidays, potentially in mid-January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. While some opinions suggest it could begin in December simultaneously with the draft, January is considered more likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This second stage of [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] is expected to be more comprehensive than the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Expansion of Martial Law
Currently, [[martial_law_and_its_implications | martial law]] applies only to the "new territories" within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. However, it is expected to be expanded to other territories, including major cities and the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The timing of this expansion will depend on the evolving situation and its dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Restrictions Under Martial Law
The introduction of [[martial_law_and_its_implications | martial law]] implies significant restrictions on civil liberties and rights for Russian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Key restrictions include:
*   **Travel Restrictions:** Limitations on travel outside the Russian Federation are expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. There might also be restrictions on movement between regions within the country in some cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. While a complete ban for all citizens is unclear, it is highly probable that the right to travel abroad will be limited for those included in the "mobilized base," estimated to be about seven million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This base could include women with military registration specialties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Detention Rights:** Under [[martial_law_and_its_implications | martial law]] norms, any person can be detained (interned) without charges for 30 days, with the possibility of extensions for an apparently unlimited period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Requisitioning of Property:** Military-civilian authorities will gain the right to requisition necessary premises, vehicles, and similar assets in cases of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Curfew and Operational Restrictions:** Authorities can impose curfews and restrictions on the operation of cultural, educational, and entertainment establishments, similar to measures during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

These measures are expected to occur after the New Year, within the framework of Kiriyenko's proposed "people's war" concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Advice for Citizens
In light of these predictions, Solovyov advises individuals to formulate a survival strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>:
*   **Assess Mobilization Risk:** If you or your family members are of draft age and potentially subject to [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]], consider whether you wish to end up in the trenches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   **Consider Leaving Russia:** If resources allow, leaving Russia is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Internal Relocation:** If moving within Russia is an option, consider it despite potential inconvenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Life:** Evaluate whether you want to risk your life or the lives of loved ones, or endure minor inconveniences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Weapon Acquisition:** Legally acquire weapons if possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
*   **Community Interaction:** Agree with neighbors on forms of interaction, as it will be needed next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.

For minors concerned about the future, specific advice is given:
*   **Continue Education:** Attend educational institutions with state accreditation to potentially defer conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>.
*   **Find a Safe Place:** If attending school isn't possible, find a place to wait out difficult months, starting the search now, or after the New Year for minors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.
*   **Go Abroad:** If there is an opportunity to go abroad and sustain oneself, do so now before the second stage of [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] begins, as leaving will likely become impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
*   **Prepare if Staying:** If ready to take risks or unable to leave, prepare for the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
*   **Value Life:** The main advice is to act in accordance with valuing one's own life and the lives of family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>. This also applies to young, mobile families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

The speaker concludes by acknowledging the gloomy prospects but emphasizes that "victory will be ours" and "the sun of a new Russia awaits" at the end of the tunnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>.

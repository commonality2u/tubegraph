Valery Solovey, in the sixth edition of his "Answers to Hot Questions" program, discussed the ongoing [[power_struggles_within_russian_elite_groups | power struggles within Russian elite groups]] and [[coalition_conflicts_in_russian_politics | coalition conflicts in Russian politics]] [00:00:22]. These internal dynamics significantly influence Russia's political landscape and policy decisions.

## Manifestations of Elite Struggle

### The Manturov Incident
A recent YouTube video depicted "Putin" (identified by Solovey as a double named Evgeny Vasilyevich) publicly reprimanding Denis Manturov over the inappropriate expenditure of funds for waste incineration plants [00:02:09]. This dialogue, far from being planned or approved, was a surprise for Manturov [00:02:32]. Solovey asserted that this incident was a "visible manifestation of the [[power_struggles_within_russian_elite_groups | struggle of elite coalitions]]" [00:02:44]. The tirade against Manturov was reportedly initiated by the [[role_and_influence_of_key_russian_political_figures_and_coalitions | Patrushev group]], which has a favorable relationship with the presidential security service that supervises the "president's double" [00:02:58]. Despite the public attack, Manturov's response was deemed "as worthily as he could answer" [00:03:14].

### Kremlin "Towers" and War Policy
The concept of "Kremlin towers" or factions within the elite is central to understanding [[russian_internal_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Russian internal political dynamics]]. While the "Kremlin towers" generally desire to end military actions against Ukraine, they differ on the terms [00:03:50].
*   The "power or Chekist one" tower seeks more militant conditions [00:03:58].
*   The "tower of the pragmatist and realists" hopes for different, presumably less aggressive, terms [00:04:08].

These internal disagreements affect transit and ceasefire plans, which remain in force but are subject to shifts due to evolving circumstances, such as military escalations [00:04:23].

## Influence of Key Figures and Coalitions

### Chemezov's Group
The group associated with Chemezov is described as having increased influence and plays a crucial role in preventing certain outcomes [00:11:04]. Their achievements include:
*   Preventing a new wave of mobilization [00:11:17].
*   Working to prevent the use of nuclear weapons, although the option has been discussed as realistic [00:11:22].
*   Blocking "many extremely dangerous things" that remain unseen by the public [00:11:38].

Solovey likened this to an unnamed American official who prevented multiple wars, demonstrating that the absence of a negative event often means someone worked behind the scenes to avert it [00:12:27]. This group, for example, blocked the potential use of tactical nuclear weapons in March-April 2022, at the cost of their careers [00:13:10].

### Efforts to Block Undesirable Plans
The speaker and others actively participate in preventing certain decisions from being implemented by "exposing cards" [00:09:11]. An example cited is the blocking of plans to appoint Viktor Khmari as acting Prime Minister, where information leaks played a significant role [00:09:41]. This highlights the [[influence_of_external_factors_and_elite_decisions_on_russian_governance | influence of external factors and elite decisions on Russian governance]].

## Future Political Transitions and Leadership

### Government Change and Prime Minister
A promised change of government and Prime Minister by the end of the year was postponed due to "unforeseen circumstances" [00:05:41]. Solovey emphasizes that these are plans and intentions, subject to unexpected variables and changes, much like personal plans in life [00:05:50].

### Potential Leadership: Manturov for President?
Addressing questions about Manturov's suitability for the presidency, Solovey sarcastically questioned if "Putin" (the double) was suitable [00:21:24]. He stated that Manturov is "certainly better" than Putin due to his human and professional qualities [00:21:36]. Public opinion, he argued, has not been a significant factor in Russian leadership for the last 30 years, stating that Putin's real support has not exceeded a third [00:21:59]. This touches upon [[russian_political_leadership_transitions_and_internal_power_dynamics | Russian political leadership transitions and internal power dynamics]] and [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | the Russian political elite and Putin]].

### Signs of a New Team in Power
When asked about visible signs of a new team coming to power, Solovey stated that such signs exist and will be evident, including arrests of high-ranking security officials [00:28:30]. He expressed confidence in these incoming individuals, knowing them personally and believing they will establish a system of control to work for the "good of society" rather than solely for personal gain [00:42:55]. This new approach aims to break the principle of treating people as a "sponge" to be squeezed for wealth [00:43:36].

## Economic Policy and Elite Decisions

### Freezing Deposits and Economic Measures
There are discussions within elite circles regarding economic measures, including freezing investments and implementing exchange restrictive steps [00:20:18]. The idea of freezing deposits, particularly larger amounts, has been discussed and could be postponed until spring/summer or launched earlier depending on circumstances [00:21:02].
A question was raised about potentially directing resources from "Putin's piggy bank" to address the economic crisis [00:24:44]. Solovey stated that access to this piggy bank is not saved and that if his group came to power, no such piggy bank would be needed due to terrifying prospects [00:24:59].

### Fate of Foreign Investors
The group currently facing "critical arrows" is actively trying to prevent measures against foreign investors [00:22:28]. This indicates an ongoing [[power_struggles_within_russian_elite_groups | struggle within Russian elite groups]] over economic policy directions and their impact on different financial interests.

## Other Relevant Issues

### Kadyrov's Relationships within the Elite
Ramzan Kadyrov's behavior reflects complex [[coalition_conflicts_in_russian_politics | coalition conflicts in Russian politics]]. He has "nasty" relations with most Russian security forces, except for Zolotov, with whom he has good ties [00:27:58]. Kadyrov also maintains an "excellent relationship" with Mishustin, who reportedly provides Chechnya with everything it needs and "even a little more" [00:28:12].

### Truth and Public Perception
Solovey believes that the truth about what happened in Russia and what was done by the "so-called Russian Elite" will be communicated and made available, though a significant part of society may not believe it due to fear or an inability to process information that destroys their worldview [00:19:14]. He describes the reality of the [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Russian political elite and Putin]]'s actions as "terrifying" and "tragic" [00:19:47].

### Cryptocurrencies and Sanctions
The Russian authorities are not preparing to arrest or confiscate cryptocurrency because they widely use it themselves as one of the few remaining tools to circumvent sanctions [00:48:07]. Crypto exchanges are reportedly under the control of the FSB, with all transactions (exceeding 20 dollars) being recorded [00:48:28].

Overall, the discourse highlights an internal political landscape characterized by [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_consolidation | complex power dynamics]], competing elite factions, and ongoing struggles over key policy decisions, particularly concerning the war in Ukraine and economic reforms.

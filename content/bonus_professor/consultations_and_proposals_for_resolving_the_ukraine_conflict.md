The conflict has acquired a fierce character, with potential for escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This situation has led to [[western_calls_for_peace_in_the_russianukrainian_conflict | Western calls for peace in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict]] and ongoing [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace proposals and negotiations between Russia and Ukraine]].

## Western Consultations on Peace Formula

Western nations, including the United States, Great Britain, and the European Union, are holding consultations on a proposed [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. These consultations have been ongoing for the past one and a half to two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Notably, these discussions have been conducted without the participation of [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | Ukraine]], despite earlier Western promises that no issues concerning [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | Ukraine]] would be resolved without its involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## The Italian Peace Formula

The West is considering the Italian formula as a basis for a [[proposal_for_peace_deal_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace deal between Russia and Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This formula proposes that [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | Ukraine]] declare itself a neutral, non-aligned state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Key elements of the Italian formula include:
*   Crimea and Donbass receiving full autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   Russian troops withdrawing to their positions as of the morning of February 24, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   Large-scale negotiations commencing on the status of Crimea and Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

## Unsuitability of the Italian Formula

The proposed Italian formula is seen as potentially unsuitable for both the Russian Federation and [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### For Russia
The formula would not suit Russia because it currently controls nearly all of the Kherson region, most of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, and a significant portion of the Zaporozhye region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Russia is unlikely to agree to abandon these "new territories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. On the contrary, steps are being taken to integrate these territories into the Russian Federation or align them closely with it, including issuing Russian passports, introducing Russian mobile operators, and establishing the ruble as an official currency in places like the Kherson region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### For Ukraine
It is difficult to imagine [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | Ukraine]] accepting such terms after the sacrifices it has made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. However, [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | Ukraine]] could potentially be forced to agree to a [[proposal_for_peace_deal_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace agreement]] by stopping the supply of necessary weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Currently, [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | Ukraine]] does not possess the technical advantage needed for a strategic counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## Western Dynamics Regarding Peace

Some "old Europe" nations, primarily Germany, France, and Italy, would like to force [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | Ukraine]] into such a cynical peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. However, Great Britain, Poland, the Baltic countries, and some smaller European states resist this desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The United States' position is particularly crucial, as the supply of weapons and military-political assistance to [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | Ukraine]] decisively depends on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. While consultations are ongoing, the US continues to resist this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

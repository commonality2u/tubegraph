The surrender of the Azovstal fighters is considered the primary military and political outcome of the week from the perspective of Russian propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This event marks a military and symbolic success for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

However, this success is stated not to represent a [[strategic_turning_point_in_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]] in the "special military operation" or the armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. It is noted that Ukrainian troops successfully counter-offended last week, pushing Russian troops away from Kharkiv, and fierce battles continue on the Seversky Donets, which are not expected to result in Russian success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Fate of the Azovstal Fighters

There are two likely options for the fate of the Azovstal fighters, which may be implemented sequentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>:

1.  **Public Trial**: For fighters associated with the Azov regiment, which is banned and declared extremist in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, a public trial is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Official Russian propaganda refers to them as a "Nazi regiment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The purpose of this trial for the Russian side is to demonstrate to its populace and the world that its demands for the "denazification of Ukraine" were justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
2.  **Prisoner Exchange**: For those not associated with the Azov regiment, there is a high probability that they will eventually be exchanged for Russian prisoners of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. The timing of such exchanges will be personally decided by the President of the Russian Federation, based on political considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

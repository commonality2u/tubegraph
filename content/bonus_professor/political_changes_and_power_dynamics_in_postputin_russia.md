According to Valery Solovey, a new reality is forming in Russia following the alleged death of Vladimir Putin on October 26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This development is considered an "irrefutable fundamental medical and anthropological fact" by Solovey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The body of the deceased president is reportedly in a frozen state at his residence in Valdai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Solovey expresses deep satisfaction regarding Putin's alleged demise, describing him as an "anthropomorphic creature" with as much humanity as a "crocodile cannibal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. He asserts that there is "no need to mourn his death" but rather "mourn the day, hour, and minute of his birth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## The "New Reality" in Russia

The formation of this [[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | new post-Putin reality]] is described as happening "before our eyes" and "with our participation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This new reality has two primary aspects: informational-psychological and political <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Informational-Psychological Aspect

The development of the topic of Putin's death in media and human consciousness is a key informational-psychological aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Thanks to the Telegram channel "General SVR" and related posts and videos, the news of Putin's death spread across Russia and the world within approximately two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The discussion of this topic, regardless of whether people believe it, has led to the formation of a "new psychological reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This means that even if people don't believe in Putin's death, they assume "something is still wrong here," leading to the concept of "delegating the topic" through jokes, caricatures, and internet memes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. For instance, the late president is now allegedly referred to as "the man from the refrigerator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

Notably, there has been an "unprecedented number of trolls" under videos discussing Putin's death, yet Solovey claims not a "single human word of sympathy for Putin" has been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Political Aspect

The [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | political aspect]] of the new reality is characterized by several features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

#### Current Leadership

The de facto ruler of Russia is now Nikolai Patrushev, who leads a group and is forming a broad coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The Russian president will be temporarily replaced by a physical double, though the duration of this replacement is unclear but expected to be a "couple of months" rather than years or decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

#### The Nature of Power Transition (State Crime)

The current power transition, where the country is "actually ruled by Nikolai Patrushev" and the "former president is being replaced by his double," constitutes a state crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This falls under Article 357 of the Criminal Code, which covers conspiracy with the purpose of capturing or retaining power, and seizure or retention of power by unconstitutional means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Those who know about these events and will form the new government are considered "state criminals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

#### Regional Power Dynamics: Chechnya and the North Caucasus

Recent events in Chechnya and the North Caucasus are seen as demonstrations of strength within the new coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Ramzan Kadyrov, who personifies Chechnya, has received heavy weapons that previously belonged to Wagner, obtaining them from the Russian Guard and his partner Zolotov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Additionally, two new battalions are being formed, including one called "Sheikh Mansur" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

The riot in Makhachkala two days after Putin's alleged death is also interpreted as a means for certain members of the coalition to "achieve some preferences for themselves" and "demonstrate their strength" to the new government, showing that they can threaten stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. This is particularly significant given that "security officers, to put it mildly, do not like the Chechen leadership," which will lead to efforts to limit Chechen freedom and extraterritoriality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

#### Shift in Foreign Policy

Another feature of the [[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | new political reality]] is Russia's withdrawal from supporting the Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This came about through behind-the-scenes negotiations following a call from Netanyahu, with Israel seeking to minimize Russia's help to "international terrorist networks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This was achieved by blackmail, with the threat of revealing the secret of the Russian president's location and health status (at the time, he was still alive but "deeply unwell") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

#### Upcoming Government Appointments

New government appointments are expected soon, as a "new balance of power is being formed" and a "new government will crystallize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. These appointments will reflect the new configuration of [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | power dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

## Evidence and Public Perception

While official statements from press secretary Peskov are dismissed as unreliable, likened to his denial of Russia's 2022 attack on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, a medical report on Putin's death, made by doctors, is said to exist and will be presented "at the right time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The speaker also questions the public's acceptance of Prigozhin's death based solely on official statements, urging critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

More and more facts, confirmations, and human testimonies are expected to emerge, which will "convince everyone that fundamental reality has changed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The speaker encourages participation in forming this new reality, including by reposting information and providing material support to channels like "General SVR" and "My Doctor Nightingale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

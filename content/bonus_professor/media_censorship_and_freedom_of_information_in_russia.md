The landscape of [[information_iron_curtain_and_media_restrictions_in_russia | information and media]] in Russia has undergone significant changes, particularly concerning [[human_rights_and_freedom_of_speech_in_russia | freedom of speech]] and access to independent sources.

## Erosion of Independent Media and Alternative Views

"Independent media" in Russia have effectively disappeared, even though they could "never be called independent in the full sense" previously [00:12:00]. However, they did provide "at least an alternative point of view" [00:12:08]. Now, these "instruments of influence have disappeared" [00:12:00].

## Restrictions on Public Discourse and Opinion Leaders

Currently, there are no "leaders of public opinion" who can speak out [00:12:37]. It is becoming "impossible to call the movement anti-in yen" (anti-war) or for any dissenting opinion not to be "considered seditious" [00:12:49]. Even figures like Navalny, calling from prison for people to go out, cannot achieve results due to the pervasive police presence making organization impossible [00:13:16].

The role of public opinion leaders is now limited to maintaining "the spark so that it does not go out completely" and educating people about current events [00:13:51].

## State Propaganda and Information Control

[[state_propaganda_and_media_influence_in_russia | Propaganda]] and "patriotic dope" are actively at work [00:26:23]. Official data on public support for actions, such as 70% support, are considered "profanation" given the short timeframe for collection and the tendency of people to give "socially approved answers" [00:26:30].

Television is now seen as "pointless to watch" for news, leading people to seek alternatives like YouTube [00:27:23].

### Escalation of Media Restrictions

The authorities have systematically destroyed "all alternative channels" of information [00:29:57]. Within Russia, no one dares to name or distribute information that contradicts the official narrative [00:30:05]. While information about the Afghan War was distributed orally, it is uncertain if current information will spread, especially if the "special operation" is concluded quickly [00:30:21].

There is a concerted effort to block platforms like Facebook and Twitter, with work also underway to block YouTube [00:36:13]. Viewers are advised to install VPNs immediately, as it may soon be impossible to access external information [00:36:26]. The process of blocking social networks is considered a "decided issue" [00:39:32].

This systematic control aims to ensure "total loyalty" from the population, with purges targeting "troublemakers" and even ordinary people to "intimidate the mass layers" [00:49:42]. There will be "no principles and signs" for who is targeted, as the goal is to identify and punish "troublemakers" to enforce loyalty [00:50:12].

## Impact on Access to Information

The current generation of Russian people, who grew up under Putin, will learn what a "deficit" is â€“ a lack of essential goods [01:03:33]. This extends to medical supplies, as there will be problems with consumables for equipment like ultrasound and MRI machines [01:15:11]. The speaker anticipates a return to "hell" for both Ukraine and Russia, created by "one person" [01:31:05].

The current situation is characterized by a lack of access to information, leading to people behaving as they always have, not wanting to see or hear "unacceptable" things [03:19:00].

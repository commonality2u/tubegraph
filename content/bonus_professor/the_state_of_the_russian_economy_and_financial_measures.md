The Russian economy is experiencing a "steep dive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Forecasts indicate a deteriorating economic and social situation, potentially leading to a socio-economic catastrophe comparable to or worse than what Russia experienced in the early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.

## Ruble Volatility

A significant fall of the ruble was experienced, which had been foreseen by prior forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. The head of the Central Bank had predicted the dollar could rise to 120 rubles by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. While it initially rose to 115-118 rubles and then fell to 105 rubles, the forecast was considered surprisingly accurate in terms of both volume and timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

*   **Saving Savings:** Individuals who followed advice to buy Euros and Dollars to save their savings were "winners" or at least managed to preserve their modest savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Temporary Stabilization:** A temporary and partial stabilization of the foreign exchange market has occurred, with the ruble exchange rate currently rising against the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.

## Imminent Financial Measures

The Russian leadership, including the financial block, monetary authorities, government, and "Politburo 2.0," is guided by unambiguous forecasts predicting a worsening [[economic_and_political_situation_in_russia | economic and political situation in Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. As part of preparing for this, a fundamental decision has been made with 100% consensus within the Russian leadership to freeze bank deposits and accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

There are two key questions regarding this measure:
1.  **Timing:** When will it happen? It could be at the turn of spring and summer, or even earlier if the situation deteriorates rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
2.  **Conditions:** What will be the conditions?
    *   **"Humane Option":** A "soft vegetarian option" suggests leaving an insured amount (e.g., 1,400,000 rubles) at the depositor's disposal, while everything above that would be frozen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
    *   **"Extreme Option":** Another option involves freezing everything that exceeds even 20,000 rubles, and introducing strict limits on both cash withdrawals and non-cash settlements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Further details on the conditions are not yet clear, but information will be shared as it becomes available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

This decision, aimed at "preventing or mitigating" the catastrophe, will always be "at the expense of society and to the detriment of the interests of society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. The leadership views the population as "insects" or a "lower form of life," assuming they will "survive perfectly on subsistence food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

## Initial Expectations of the Kyiv Visit

During the visit of the "big three" leaders — Draghi, Macron, and Scholz — to Kyiv, the primary expectation was that they would persuade Ukrainian President Zelensky to engage in [[peace_negotiations_with_Ukraine | peace talks with Russia]] and even consider territorial compromises with the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Sources indicated that this behind-the-scenes objective was largely justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Draghi and Macron were identified as the main persuaders, with Scholz acting as an "extra" in these conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. It was suggested that the Kremlin possessed "serious, reliable, and sensitive dirt" on Draghi and Macron, influencing their role in the [[european_political_influence_and_negotiations | negotiations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Outcome of the Negotiations

Contrary to initial expectations, the public statement released after the [[negotiations_and_peace_talks_in_kyiv | negotiations]] was "directly opposite" to the original intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The leaders declared unconditional support for Ukraine's position, including its territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. It was made clear that [[peace_negotiations_with_Ukraine | peace negotiations]] would not commence without Ukraine achieving some success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Reasons for the Shift in Position

Several factors are believed to have contributed to this change in position:
*   **Zelensky's Firm Stance** Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky maintained a tough stance, making it difficult to exert pressure on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Western Support** The strong position of the United States, Great Britain, and a significant portion of NATO countries played a crucial role. These nations favored a resolution or preparation for [[peace_negotiations_with_Ukraine | peace negotiations]] on the battlefield, even if it meant a prolonged conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Emotional Impact** A "psycho-emotional impact" on the visiting "troika" after their visit to Irpin may have also influenced their stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Broader Western Consultations and Aid

Following the "big three" visit, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also traveled to Kyiv, confirming his unconditional solidarity with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The critical issue remains the provision of substantial and high-quality military assistance that would allow Ukraine to achieve at least equality with the Russian Federation or a strategic turn on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Such assistance can only be provided by the United States, which appears ready to do so despite the risk of escalating conflict with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

It is anticipated that this aid, including weapons and trained personnel, will become evident by July, potentially leading to qualitative changes on the battlefield by the end of July or beginning of August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Ukraine's Stance on Future Negotiations

David Arakhamia, head of Ukraine's negotiating group with Russia, recently stated that Ukraine might resume [[peace_negotiations_with_Ukraine | negotiations with Russia]] by the end of August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This timing is based on his calculation that Ukraine's negotiating position would be strengthened by then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This strengthening implies not only the arrival of new weapons and proficient Ukrainian military use of them, but also significant changes on the battlefield, potentially including the return of Kherson to Ukrainian control and a counteroffensive in Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

However, the resumption of talks does not imply an immediate peace. Both Boris Johnson and NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg have called on NATO countries to prepare for a long campaign and long-term assistance to Ukraine, extending for several years. This assistance includes military aid, support for state infrastructure, and aid for Ukraine's restoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Kremlin's View on Peace

The Kremlin, while preparing for a prolonged "special military operation," also aims to achieve some result by the end of autumn or beginning of winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This desire is influenced by internal political dynamics, including the potential for a decision on the transfer of power and the gradual replacement of President Putin, possibly in late autumn or early winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. In this context, a prolonged military agenda would interfere with primary political objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

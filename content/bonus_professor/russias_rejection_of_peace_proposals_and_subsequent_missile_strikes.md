On November 16, 2022, it was confirmed that the Kremlin, specifically President Putin, had rejected a [[potential_peace_proposals_between_russia_and_ukraine | Peace Proposal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This rejection was evidenced by a massive missile strike launched on Ukrainian infrastructure on November 15, which was carried out on an unprecedentedly large scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The reaction to the [[potential_peace_proposals_between_russia_and_ukraine | Peace Proposal]] was contingent on whether or not such massive missile strikes would be launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Immediate Aftermath

This event signifies an escalation of [[russian_military_actions_in_ukraine | military action]], moving to a new, more dangerous phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Putin has decided to employ a strategy of "spearhead counter-escalation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Incident in Poland
A tragic incident occurred in Poland where missiles hit, resulting in the deaths of two Poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. While investigations are ongoing, it is unlikely this incident will become a *casus belli* or lead to NATO activating Article 5, as NATO members do not appear interested in that outcome at this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Projected Responses

### Ukraine's Escalation
Ukraine is expected to receive new weapons, including long-range ammunition and missiles, after Russia's categorical rejection of peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This means that Ukraine's armed forces will be able to strike not only border regions but also areas deeper within [[strategic_consequences_of_strikes_on_russia | Central Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The radius of destruction is expected to continuously expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This concern was highlighted by Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev being sent to inspect air defense systems in Central Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

Recent events, such as the undermining of the steel key oil depot in the Varlovskaya region, are seen as examples of what to expect from Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Ukraine may also launch new offensives, with alleged reports of Ukrainian troops going on the offensive near Popasnaya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Russia's Escalation
Russia is expected to continue massive shelling if it has enough missiles or receives them from its strategic ally in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. However, a major offensive or counteroffensive by [[russian_military_actions_in_ukraine | Russian armed forces]] in Ukraine is unlikely, as Russia has adopted a concept of strategic defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

A second stage of [[russian_mobilization_and_military_actions | mobilization]] is anticipated to occur after the New Year, though it could be accelerated if Ukrainian offensives are successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This "additional mobilization" or "completion of partial mobilization" would send newly trained mobilized individuals to the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

The escalation could also lead to the involvement of NATO countries most actively assisting Ukraine, potentially through "symmetrical strikes" like cyber attacks or sabotage of logistics hubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The conflict zone is expected to expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Internal Russian Consequences
The conflict's escalation is predicted to have significant internal consequences for Russia:

*   **Martial Law:** Martial law, currently applied to "new territories," may be extended to regions bordering Ukraine and eventually to major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This would lead to further restrictions on civil liberties, including freedom of movement, and potentially introduce curfews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. New hybrid authorities could gain powers to detain citizens without trial for up to 30 days and confiscate property from citizens and enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Economic Mobilization:** The economy will undergo further "non-stateization and mobilization," with the share of the economy connected to the "special [[russian_military_actions_in_ukraine | military operation]]" increasing beyond the current 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Declining Popularity and Tightening Screws:** Putin's popularity is rapidly declining, and protest moods are growing, albeit slower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The authorities' response is to "tighten the screws," which could lead to the collapse of "Russian statehood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This is already evident in the behavior of figures like Kadyrov, who operate outside the legal framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The [[russian_military_actions_in_ukraine | military crisis]] is expected to inevitably develop into a large-scale political crisis, potentially leading to the collapse of Russian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. While this doesn't mean Russia will disappear, it indicates a deep and acute crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

Putin's personal strategy is to continue escalation, believing it's the only way to force the West to retreat and pressure Ukraine into a [[potential_peace_proposals_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace agreement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. However, this is unlikely to happen, as the West intends to increase its own pressure on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Russia's combined power is seen as insufficient to withstand the pressure of the consolidated West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

The military crisis will also lead to an economic crisis, a financial crisis, and a political crisis, culminating in a crisis of Russian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. These are anticipated to be the darkest times in Russian history in the 21st century, comparable in scale to historical events like the Crimean War (1853-1856), the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and the First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.# Russia's Rejection of Peace Proposals and Subsequent Missile Strikes

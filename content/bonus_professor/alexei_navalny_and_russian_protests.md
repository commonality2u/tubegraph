On February 18th, a joint stream was held with the "Generals of the SVR" to discuss the political situation in Russia over the past month and a half to two months, focusing on the return of [[alexei_navalnys_imprisonment_and_its_implications | Alexei Navalny]] and the [[protests_in_russia_and_belarus | protests]] that followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Alexei Navalny's Return and Initial Protests

The return of [[the_situation_and_treatment_of_alexei_navalny | Alexei Navalny]] to Russia was described as a heroic act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. However, the expected close dynamics of a revolutionary movement that [[alexei_navalnys_imprisonment_and_its_implications | Alexei Navalny]] might have anticipated did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

After his return, a film about "Putin's palace" was viewed by over 110 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Despite this massive viewership, only about 100,000 people took to the streets in [[public_engagement_and_activism_in_russias_political_landscape | protests]], representing approximately 1.1% of those who watched the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This low turnout led to a "quite doubtful" result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Critiques of Protest Organization

The FBK (Anti-Corruption Foundation) was described as "courageous" and composed of "good guys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. However, from a professional viewpoint, there was a lack of organization in the [[protests_in_russia_and_belarus | protest]] itself, including rally movements and coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Key issues identified included:
*   **Lack of Clear Goals:** People went to rallies without specific, clearly set goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Dubious Slogans:** Not everyone was ready to protest under the slogan "for the release of [[alexei_navalnys_imprisonment_and_its_implications | Navalny]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Insufficient Appreciation for Navalny's Act:** Despite [[alexei_navalnys_imprisonment_and_its_implications | Navalny]]'s self-sacrifice, his act was not sufficiently appreciated, and organizational errors and poor communication between protesters and organizers occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Lack of Development Prospects:** People protested aimlessly, without any prospects for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. It was suggested that if the situation had been organized and coordinated, even with 30,000 people on the streets of Moscow, including 500 brave individuals, the outcome could have been "radically different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

Despite these issues, the speakers confirmed their support for these [[protests_in_russia_and_belarus | protests]], believing it would have been "stupid" not to take advantage of such a "powerful trigger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. They also expressed readiness to support future [[social_unrest_and_potential_for_protest_in_russia | protest]] actions, acknowledging that [[alexei_navalnys_imprisonment_and_its_implications | Alexei Navalny]] is currently the leader of the Russian opposition and a powerful force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Societal Readiness and Government Actions

The refusal of the FBK to engage in active [[social_unrest_and_potential_for_protest_in_russia | protests]] was considered a mistake, as society was "in principle...ready to return" for [[alexei_navalnys_imprisonment_and_its_implications | Navalny]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. The popularity of channels publishing expos√©s, such as the one on Putin's palace, indicates a readiness among the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. However, the disconnect between 110 million views of the palace film and only 100,000 protesters highlights a "statistical error" or "moral weakness" and "unpreparedness of Russian society for actions in self-defense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

It was suggested that the authorities are making "all possible mistakes" that could lead to revolutionary action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The upcoming Duma elections are expected to be rigged, which will serve as another "serious enough trigger" for the [[potential_mobilization_and_public_dissent_in_russia | protest]] movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Any revolution or significant change in a country "has always relied on a split," emphasizing the need to work with the population and the [[social_unrest_and_potential_for_protest_in_russia | protest]] movement to achieve a serious split within the elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

## Putin's Reaction and International Relations

The Kremlin and the entire Russian leadership are aware of the channel's posts, and Putin is described as fearing manipulation, which automatically reduces his plans to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. He is seen as a "rat driven into a corner" who will resist, but he is not an "idiot" and understands the rules of the game in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. The speaker emphasized that they are "not even a gram" playing by Putin's rules and know how to manipulate him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. His suspicious nature and many phobias are skillfully exploited by those around him and by the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

Putin treats [[alexei_navalnys_imprisonment_and_its_implications | Navalny]] as a personal enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. He also kills not only enemies but many others based on recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

In terms of foreign politicians, Putin respects any US president, fearing them as a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. He is genuinely afraid to oppose the interests of the United States, and classic espionage activity on US territory was minimal during his reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. He has transitioned to hybrid warfare methods, including cyber attacks on the US, France, and Germany, as he finds them more effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.

He also respects the Chinese leader, who holds "quite serious leverage" over Putin, leading Putin to fulfill "all the whims and desires of the Chinese leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Angela Merkel and Erdogan are also respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. Erdogan is considered his "alter ego" because Putin's intelligence helped him avoid a coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>.

## Future Outlook for Protests and Change

The degree of tension and radicalism among the Russian population has grown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>. Those who participated in the [[protests_in_russia_and_belarus | actions]] of January 23-31 expressed no regret, instead wishing they had acted "more actively" and resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>. It is believed that playing by Putin's rules will never lead to victory; instead, when he prohibits something, people should do the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:10">[00:52:10]</a>.

The government is currently in a "worst position" since 1996, indicating its instability and fragility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>. It is asserted that even if Putin were to order shooting at protesters, it would likely not happen, as there is an opportunity to influence the operational level of subordination and management to prevent such orders from being carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>.

### Comparison to Belarusian Protests

The speaker expressed reluctance to advise [[protests_in_russia_and_belarus | Belarusians]], calling it a "sore subject" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>. They previously warned Lukashenko of an assassination attempt and coup being prepared by Babich, then the ambassador to [[impact_of_external_factors_on_belarusian_protests_and_opposition | Belarus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:07]</a>. While they believed they were acting correctly at the time, they are now "not very confident" in that assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.

Regarding Putin's relationship with Lukashenko, it is stated that Lukashenko "twists Putin" as he wants, even joking that Putin is "almost on his knees asking to let go of the woman river" and will undoubtedly grant Belarus a loan of 3 billion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:14">[00:55:14]</a>. The Russian government's actions against [[protests_in_russia_and_belarus | protests]] are seen as less brutal than those in [[impact_of_external_factors_on_belarusian_protests_and_opposition | Belarus]], which is described as "terrible" and requiring accountability for the "bastard" responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>.

### Reforming Special Services and Judiciary

The possibility of reforming Russian special services to serve society is deemed "undoubtedly" possible, citing Georgia's experience under Mikheil Saakashvili, where police and special services were completely reformed to eliminate corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>.

It is suggested that the main purge should begin with the judicial corps, advocating for "complete lustration of the entire judicial corps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>. Once an "honest and decent court" is established, further reforms of the special services will follow, with everything expected to be in order in "quite short terms from a historical perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>.

The widespread opinion that Russian special services are degraded, based on incidents like the poisoning of Skripal and [[alexei_navalnys_imprisonment_and_its_implications | Alexei Navalny]], is seen as a "degradation of stupid groups of people" rather than the entire service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. Russian special services are considered "quite professionally" capable; if the criminal component (murders, special operations, hybrid war) were removed and they focused on real external and internal threats (not fighting opposition or crime), they could be preserved and brought to a "qualitatively new level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>.

The granting of candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova for European Union membership represents a symbolic shift in Ukraine's civilizational vector, moving it away from Russia and towards Europe. This change was notably influenced by the actions of Russian President Vladimir Putin himself, who is described as having "literally pushed Ukraine out of the potential embrace of the Russian world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## Western Perceptions of Putin and Russia

Public sentiment in Western countries has seen Putin widely reported as the "most unpopular, the most disrespected politician in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>. However, this public opinion is less significant than the change in attitude among the Western establishment, particularly in key European nations. Their diminished respect for Putin is not primarily due to the commencement of the "special military operation" on February 24, but rather because he "could not and cannot quickly lead this operation to success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:17:00">[15:17:00]</a>. This failure to achieve a swift victory has led to a perception of "contempt and mockery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a> towards the Russian president and the Russian Armed Forces.

## Shift to a "Besieged Fortress" Regime

In response to the failure of a quick victory (Blitzkrieg), the Kremlin has shifted its strategy to prepare for a "long confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>. This involves Russia transitioning into a "regime of a besieged fortress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>, which encompasses several key aspects:

### Propaganda and Information Control

Since autumn, the Kremlin's propaganda strategy is expected to shift from mobilization-driven hysteria to promoting a "new normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>. This new narrative aims to inject optimism and normalize the current [[political_and_economic_climate_in_russia | state of affairs]] by emphasizing that Russia has "always been in confrontation with the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a> and people must get used to it, finding pleasure in their current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.

### Intensification of Repressive Practices

To maintain control within the "besieged fortress" regime, administrative and police control over society is intensifying through repressive practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>. These measures include:

*   **Expanded "Foreign Agent" Law:** The law on "foreign agents" has been extended to include individuals under "Western influence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>. This broad definition means activities like studying a foreign language, touring abroad, or corresponding with foreigners could potentially be deemed "Western influence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>, especially from "unfriendly Russian countries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>.
*   **Unauthorized Contact with Foreigners:** Amendments to the law on state secrets (GOS Change) suggest that "unauthorized contact with a foreigner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:00">[19:13:00]</a> could be considered "almost treason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>, with penalties up to eight years and a fine of a million rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.
*   **Selective Exit Visas:** There is an "actual selective introduction of exit visas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>. An example given is the renowned director Sakurov, who was prevented from attending a conference in Milan based on "direct instructions of the Moscow leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>. The implied message is that for those deemed disloyal, the "main punishment is to be where it is right in your homeland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:18:00">[21:18:00]</a>.

These practices, reminiscent of "Stalinist practices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>, do not require mass application. The modern media allows for a multiplier effect, meaning that "isolated cases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a> can be widely publicized, sending a message to the wider population without imprisoning hundreds of thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>. These repressive trends are expected to "not only continue, but will intensify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>.

### Kremlin's Confidence and Belief in Success

Despite the strong control measures, there is doubt about the authorities' confidence in their success. The fact that they "turn to all sorts of dubious things like magical rituals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a> suggests a lack of self-belief and rationality in their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:57:00">[21:57:00]</a>.

*   **Magical Rituals:** On June 22, the summer solstice, a "black magic ritual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a> was held at 4 AM (the same time as the start of the war) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:23:00">[22:23:00]</a>. High-ranking officials of the Russian Federation participated, with the purpose of granting victory to the Russian army and strengthening Putin's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:41:00">[22:41:00]</a>.

### Emergence of Anti-Security Forces Coalition

Within [[russian_political_climate | Russian political circles]], there are signs of an emerging "coalition of oligarchs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:35:00">[23:35:00]</a>, including figures like Deripaska, Abramovich, Potanin, and Chubais, who are described as forming an "anti-security forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a> or "anti-patrol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:48:00">[23:48:00]</a> coalition. The swift and "too hasty a reaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19:00">[24:19:00]</a> from Oleg Deripaska on his Telegram channel, refuting his involvement in any conspiracy, indicates that these messages have touched a nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:00">[24:45:00]</a>. This suggests underlying tensions and shifts within the [[political_situation_in_russia | Russian elite]].

### Public Opinion and Morale

Amidst these [[internal_political_issues_and_public_perception_in_russia | political and social dynamics]], there's an ongoing call to help those who "are trying to protect in Russia, despite everything, common sense, moral values ​​and human dignity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:07:00">[25:07:00]</a>. This points to a segment of the [[Public discontent and political dynamics in Russia | population]] striving to uphold ethical principles within the current atmosphere. Despite the difficulties, there is an enduring belief that "trouble will be for us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>, suggesting a resilient, albeit challenging, outlook for the future of Russia.

The speaker frequently discusses the [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | alleged death of Vladimir Putin]] and its potential implications for the future of Russia, including the [[yevgeny_prigozhins_return_to_russia | return of Yevgeny Prigozhin]].

## [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | Speculation on Putin's Death]]

The speaker states that the death of the president occurred on the evening of October 26, 2023, around midnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57">[01:57]</a>. This event is linked to FSO exercises conducted from November 1-3, which are noted to be regular but emphasized with unusual persistence, including the potential use of armored vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40">[01:40]</a>.

Further support for the claim of Putin's death comes from alleged forensic analyses:
*   A phonoscopic examination, conducted by Japanese researchers, confirmed the "presence of doubles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06">[06:06]</a>. This type of examination is considered as reliable as fingerprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18">[06:18]</a>.
*   An anthropological examination comparing "different Putins" was also reportedly conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09">[06:09]</a>.
*   A specific "double," referred to as "Vasilich," replaced the president after his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29">[24:29]</a>. Another "technical double" was used for public appearances where speaking was not required, controlled by the Federal Guard Service (FSO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42">[24:42]</a>.
*   The speaker claims that the exact day of Putin's death was predicted with an error of only three or four days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26">[21:26]</a>.

### International Awareness
The speaker asserts that the West, China, and Israel are aware of Putin's death but are satisfied with the current state of affairs and interested in maintaining the current regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49">[12:49]</a>.

Regarding Ukraine's silence on the matter, two assumptions are offered:
1.  Fear of making a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15">[13:15]</a>.
2.  Ukrainian leadership's fear that if Putin's death is confirmed, it could change the dynamic of peace negotiations. Ukraine previously cited Putin's existence as a main obstacle to peace, and his death would remove this obstacle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40">[13:40]</a>.

### Post-Putin Russian Leadership
Nikolai Patrushev is identified as the new supreme ruler of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00">[08:00]</a>. His team is expected to "tighten the screws" on social networks in the lead-up to the transfer of power, as a "double" cannot lead Russia for long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12">[08:12]</a>. Patrushev is described as hating oligarchs and Putin's entourage, being a "man of the old formation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10">[20:10]</a>.

The transfer of heavy weapons to Chechnya is interpreted as Ramzan Kadyrov's awareness of what transpired in the Kremlin and his preparation to play his own game against the new Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00">[21:00]</a>.

## [[yevgeny_prigozhins_return_to_russia | Potential Return of Yevgeny Prigozhin]]

The speaker predicts that [[yevgeny_prigozhins_return_to_russia | Prigozhin will return after Putin's death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15">[04:15]</a>. However, the exact timing is unknown, as Prigozhin himself has not yet decided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19">[04:19]</a>. The most suitable moment for his appearance is expected to be when "internecine struggle for power begins" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32">[04:32]</a>. He is anticipated to "appear like the Jack-in-the-box" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34">[04:34]</a>.

In contrast, Sergei Shoigu is deemed unable to seize power, and no one would support him due to widespread skeptical and hostile attitudes among elite groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:07">[24:07]</a>.

## Future Outlook

### Economic Impact
The ruble exchange rate is expected to fall again after a temporary strengthening, due to the overall situation of the Russian economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34">[02:34]</a>.

### Social and Political Landscape
*   Surveillance on social networks is expected to strengthen under Patrushev's team, not weaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58">[07:58]</a>.
*   The speaker is not optimistic that the Russian population will acknowledge the atrocities committed or apologize to Ukrainians, believing people will try to ignore the "bloody confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42">[06:42]</a>. Education and explanation are needed for people to understand the negative results for both Ukraine and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16">[07:16]</a>.
*   Demographic trends, such as low birth rates among ethnic Russians, are deeply ingrained and will take 10-15 years to show any effect, even with serious efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00">[12:00]</a>. The speaker's team reportedly has a program to increase the birth rate among indigenous populations of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36">[12:36]</a>.

### Ukraine-Russia Relations
*   The speaker is cautious about outlining peace terms for Ukraine but notes a "predominant" desire for peace within the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17">[11:17]</a>.
*   It is hoped that peace will be concluded with a "new government of the new Russia," rather than a continuation or more severe modification of Putin's government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26">[11:26]</a>.
*   Russia, under its new leadership (Patrushev), intends to take Avdiivka at all costs, despite colossal losses, believing this will increase the chances of the West forcing Ukraine into peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53">[22:53]</a>.
*   Separately, the new Russian leadership is proposing peace talks through Lukashenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17">[23:17]</a>.

### Regional Conflicts
*   Rumors of a Russian attack on Lithuania in 2027 are dismissed. While Putin had plans for a large-scale "hybrid operation" against the Baltic countries in 2019 (proposed by General Gerasimov), these were not implemented due to the pandemic and warnings from the US and NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00">[15:00]</a>. Currently, Russia has "no time for Lithuania, no time for the Baltics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50">[15:50]</a>.
*   The likelihood of a third Chechen war is discussed, noting accumulating weapons, growing hostilities, and interested parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31">[23:31]</a>. However, a "free-floating" Chechen Republic will not be permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41">[23:41]</a>.
*   Regarding Abkhazia, the speaker does not foresee its return to Georgia, as no Abkhazian wishes for it. A "bad peace is better than a good quarrel" is suggested, acknowledging the painful history but lacking a mutually acceptable solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:58">[21:58]</a>.

This article is based on the 45th issue of Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel program "What is Happening," recorded on Sunday, December 25th, at noon and released on Monday, December 26th. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>

## Comparative PR Strategies: Putin vs. Zelensky

The program highlights a perceived mirroring of public relations strategies between Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky, with Zelensky generally "outplaying" Putin. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> This forces Putin to respond to Zelensky's "breakthrough image." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>

Noteworthy comparisons include:
*   Zelensky visited Bakhmut, while Putin allegedly visited Rostov at the headquarters of the United Branches of the Armed Forces. It is claimed Putin was not actually there, but met with military personnel elsewhere. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   Zelensky awarded fighters on the front line, while Putin held a small Kremlin meeting. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
*   Zelensky held a meeting with US President Biden, while Putin met with the alleged President of Belarus, Lukashenko. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>
    *   It is suggested that the Putin who jumped briskly off the plane in Minsk was a body double, intended to demonstrate the "excellent physical condition of the current President." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>
    *   The person partaking in the "bread and salt" tradition is also stated to not be President Putin, due to "insurmountable circumstances." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>
*   Zelensky spoke before the US Congress, while Putin delivered a speech where "half a good half" of his colleagues allegedly fell asleep. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>
*   Putin also appeared to journalists and on a TV show with a mini-interview. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

It is stated that the initiative in foreign policy, where reputation and image are formed, now rests with the Ukrainian president. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>

## Preparation for a Decisive Battle

Both parties are concentrating forces for a decisive battle. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>

### Ukraine's Preparations
Ukraine, according to President Biden, is expected to receive significant military aid from NATO and allies, including:
*   2,000 tanks and other armored vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>
*   More than 800 artillery systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   More than 2 million shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>
*   More than 800 multiple launch rocket systems (MLRS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>
This equipment is needed for a "strategic offensive" to reach Ukraine's state borders with Russia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>

### Russia's Responses
The Russian Federation is responding by striking Ukraine's energy system, aiming to de-energize the country, cause industrial disorganization, demoralize Ukrainian society, generate public pressure on Zelensky, and trigger a new wave of emigration towards European countries. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>

Russia also hopes to receive new weapons systems from Iran, primarily ballistic missiles. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> The head of Israeli Mossad publicly stated that a first batch of these missiles would allegedly be transferred to the Russian Federation from Iran before the New Year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a> These are expected to be used and will not be the last batch. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a> Russia and Iran are expected to deny this to worldwide publicity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>

## [[Mobilization in Russia and potential nationwide mobilization | Mobilization in Russia]]

### Need for Manpower
Russia's primary response to the current situation is the [[russian_mobilization_and_military_actions | mobilization]] and concentration of manpower. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a> This reliance on manpower stems from a perceived lack of modern advanced weapons and a desire to win. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a> The current approach echoes the mid-20th century strategy of betting on manpower, though Russia's demographic potential is now incomparably lower than that of the Soviet Union. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a> Changes to service terms and the need to increase troop numbers, discussed at the Ministry of Defense session, are seen as part of the propaganda preparations for a new [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a> The Kremlin reportedly believes a quantitative advantage is necessary to achieve victory or even honorable peace terms with Ukraine. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>

### Anticipated New [[Mobilization process in Russia | Mobilization process in Russia]]
A new stage of [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] is expected soon after the New Year holidays. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> This could involve:
*   **Border Closures**: A partial or complete closure of borders, most likely partial for those within the [[potential_mobilization_and_military_service_changes_in_russia | mobilization]] base. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>
*   **[[General mobilization readiness in Russia | Mobilization]] Base Size**: The base will presumably contain around 7 million people, though not all will be mobilized. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>
*   **Targeted Mobilization**: The aim is to mobilize approximately 2 million people, including 300,000 women. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>
*   **Internal Movement Restrictions**: There may be limited movement between subjects of the Russian Federation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>
*   **Enforcement**: The Guard police and DZOV (Defense and Civil Protection) workers will be used more intensively for detection, identification, and escort of mobilized personnel to collection points. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>

### Training and Deployment Challenges
There are practically no places left in the European part of Russia for training mobilized personnel, and taking them to the Urals and Siberia is not planned. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a> Therefore, almost immediately after arriving at military enlistment offices, mobilized personnel will be sent to the front line without preliminary training. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a> The Russian Federation reportedly lacks the organizational and technical capacity to provide full-fledged training for such a significant contingent, a fact acknowledged at the defense session. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>

### Public Response and Recruitment Methods
While some people are expected to hide or attempt to leave Russia, significant resistance is not anticipated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a> Kremlin sociology (from the Federal Security Service) indicates that people are "resignedly" ready for [[russian_political_and_military_mobilization | mobilization]], despite disliking it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>

Notorious figure Yevgeny Prigozhin has publicly admitted to recruiting from colonies and prisons, offering inmates a chance to "wash away their guilt" with blood. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> He has proposed using both male and women's penal colonies, citing "local experience" in using women in military conditions, including in assault squads. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a> Rumors from "extremely pressed and well-informed sources" suggest even attracting patients from neuropsychiatric dispensaries to participate in the creation of the "famous Surovikin line," a defensive line intended to "smash" the Ukrainian strategic offensive. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a> After this, Russia plans its own counteroffensive, potentially using the territory of Belarus and other directions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>

## Russia's Definition of "Victory"

Putin's plan for a "victorious completion" of the special military operation, possibly by mid-summer, has been conveyed in a message to "comrade Xi" (likely Xi Jinping). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a> It is claimed that Xi set conditions for visiting Moscow or even telephone conversations, requiring Russia to provide a plan for completing the "special military operation." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>

The message from Putin asserts confidence in "final victory" no later than mid-summer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a> "Victory" in this context reportedly means the acquisition or control over "some other new territories" and an exit to peace negotiations, a truce, a ceasefire, or potentially even a peace treaty. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>

Initially, Putin stated the goals were "demilitarization" and "denazification." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a> Now, another goal has emerged: the "unification of the Russian people," a goal that claims globalism. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> This goal is questioned, highlighting that large groups of ethnic Russians live in countries like Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and the Baltic states, and their desire to unite with Russia is doubted. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a> It is argued that Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians are distinct peoples, despite ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and historical closeness. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a> Russia's efforts are seen as alienating any group that might have sympathized with Russia, causing them to "flee from Russia like from a leper country," as Russia brings "brotherly love with the help of missiles and artillery shells." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a> This goal is deemed "fantastic," "counterproductive," and causes wariness in sovereign countries, both near and far from Russia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>

## China's Stance on Russia
China, through its largest sea transportation operator, China COSCO, has refused to transport oil from Russia since December 5th, following the introduction of an oil price ceiling and export restrictions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a> A similar boycott has been announced by a Greek sea transportation company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a> This behavior is described as China treating the Russian Federation like "a cook treats potatoes, doing with it practically whatever they would like." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>

## Recent Protest Dynamics in Russia

The speaker notes that [[public_dissatisfaction_and_political_implications_in_russia | confusion and chaos]] are "inevitable" in Russia during a power transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Vladimir Putin and Succession

Vladimir Putin reportedly stopped initiating conversations about power transfer in December, specifically when [[alexei_navalny_and_russian_protests | Alexei Navalny]] announced his return to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Putin resumed discussions about succession after the FBK (Anti-Corruption Foundation) announced it was abandoning *active* and *mass public events*, though not all protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

### "Light the Flashlights" Action (February 14)

The speaker was initially skeptical of the "light the flashlights" action planned for February 14th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. However, the Russian government made a "classic mistake" by inadvertently helping its opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. A State Duma official compared those intending to protest on February 14th to "collaborators" and "traitors," which contributed to the dissemination of information about the protest and motivated people to participate to "do harm to those in power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

From a strategic perspective, such an action would have been more effective in late autumn or winter, when [[alexei_navalny_and_russian_protests | Alexei Navalny]] was in Germany but his return was anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Ideally, civic activity should escalate from "relatively safe forms" to "more dangerous ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. However, the trajectory from January 23rd, 31st, and February 2nd saw "dangerous mass forms" of protest, followed by a shift to a "safer" form like the flashlight action, which represents a decrease in intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

Despite this, the speaker believes the [[social_unrest_and_potential_for_protest_in_russia | protest potential]] has not decreased and could have sustained for at least another two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The authorities perceived the "respite" in protests as their "own achievement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. They plan to "completely disavow any protest activity by approximately the beginning of May" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, through both repressive policies (administrative and police measures) and, primarily, informational efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. Large sums have been allocated to bribe opinion leaders for disinformation campaigns, and 2-3 high-profile anti-corruption cases are expected to be initiated to demonstrate the government's anti-corruption efforts surpass those of [[alexei_navalny_and_russian_protests | Alexei Navalny]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

### Overall Protest Potential

The speaker states that the [[social_unrest_and_potential_for_protest_in_russia | protest potential]] has not decreased at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:55">[01:06:55]</a>. The state has become a "policeman," with authorities reaching "another bottom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:37">[00:38:37]</a>. Peaceful protests are met with "brutal suppression," leading to resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:15">[00:39:15]</a>. A core of 50-200 people among a large crowd is enough to initiate resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:23">[00:39:23]</a>. This does not mean the protest turns non-peaceful but resorts to "self-defense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>.

It is not necessary for the majority to want changes for them to occur; a motivated minority is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. The "colossal shift" observed in late January/early February, in terms of geography and numbers, is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. If an additional "two or three percent of the population" supports this movement, it could coincide with a "split of the elites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. The demand for changes in Russia is "colossal," possibly even higher than at the end of the late Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>. Many people are ready to make sacrifices for these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

## Protests in Belarus

The speaker was asked about the possibility of uniting or coordinating Russian and Belarusian protests. From the speaker's viewpoint, they "cannot be coordinated," but they will be "interconnected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. The dynamics in Belarus can influence Russia, and strong grassroots dynamics in Russia could inspire Belarusian "brothers and comrades" to similar strong performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.

### Comparison of Protest Phases

The speaker uses Ukraine and Belarus as examples for protest development: peaceful protests, brutal suppression, and then the beginning of resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>. Ukraine moved through these phases, but Belarus "has not moved to this second phase" of resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.

### Unification with Russia

There is "no chance at all" for the unification of Belarus and Russia into a single state, especially after the events in Belarus since August 10, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:32">[00:42:32]</a>. For such a discussion to occur, both Belarus and Russia would need to change their governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. The Belarusian society does not want unification with Russia, nor do Russian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:57">[00:42:57]</a>.

### Law Enforcement Response

Moscow and St. Petersburg police are "not delighted" about confronting protesters and dislike it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. There are instances of "quiet sabotage," where officers stop following orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:16">[01:10:16]</a>. According to police contacts, the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) in Russia would "fall apart much faster than the MVD of Ukraine" in a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>. While the commander of the Russian Guard is ready to carry out "any order," "not everyone is ready to break their heads" for these orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Broader Context and Outlook

The speaker states that Russia will go through a "severe national crisis," but not a civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>. This is seen as the only "path to the future" given the government's actions over the past 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>. The current system is described as "inefficient" and "ineffective," with Russia being a "degrading country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:57">[01:24:57]</a>. The speaker believes Russia can be transformed, as it possesses sufficient resources and "very good people" who are currently "numb" and "repressed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. Given freedom, stability, and internal development, a "Russian miracle" is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.

The 21st episode of "What is Happening," recorded on Sunday, July 17th, and released on Monday, July 18th, focuses on the Kremlin's foreign policy and its use of blackmail as an instrument of foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The program discusses the difficult choices facing the Kremlin, oscillating between "the unacceptable and the impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## State Duma Meeting and Unmet Expectations

The main event of the past week was the expectation surrounding the State Duma meeting on July 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Despite high and alarming expectations, the meeting yielded minimal results, described as the "mountain gave birth not even to mice with cancer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The key outcomes were the appointment of Denis Manturov as vice-premier for import substitution and the adoption of several laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

There were several options prepared for this meeting, including the announcement of martial law in border regions with Ukraine, and other cardinal measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. However, the President of Russia did not dare to proceed with a cardinal option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This hesitation reflects the understanding that "fate does not always help the daring," contrasting with the belief that led to the "special military operation" on February 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Kremlin's Dilemmas and Internal Views

The hesitations of the Russian Federation president are not only due to the "not most successful move" of the "special military operation" but also reflect the mood of the ruling elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, showcasing [[Kremlin internal political dynamics | Kremlin internal political dynamics]].

Within the ruling elites, two main viewpoints have crystallized regarding the outcome of the special military operation:
*   **Majority View:** This group, including the military, advocates for contentment with the status quo, meaning the achieved territorial acquisitions, and then seeking negotiations or a truce with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This represents a certain [[Kremlins perception of peace with Ukraine | Kremlin's perception of peace with Ukraine]].
*   **Radical Minority View:** This influential minority believes Russia must fight "to the end" for a victorious conclusion, which would involve taking control of Kharkov, Dnepropetrovsk (now Dnepr), the entire Black Sea coast (Nikolaev and Odessa regions), and potentially entering and taking control of Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This reflects [[Kremlins strategic challenges and alliances | Kremlin's strategic challenges and alliances]].

The president is hesitant because while the radical minority is influential, the moderate majority is persistent and reflects the opinion of the military establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The first option (stopping now and peace treaty) is deemed unacceptable by Ukraine and its active Western supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, indicating [[Kremlins rejection of Peace Proposal | Kremlin's rejection of Peace Proposal]]. The second option (fighting to the bitter end) is considered unlikely to be implemented from a military point of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Blackmail as a Foreign Policy Instrument

The [[Kremlins international relations and policies | Kremlin]] is attempting to resolve this dilemma by pressuring Europe to, in turn, pressure Ukraine into an agreement on Russian terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This strategy is part of [[Kremlins Strategy and Negotiations | Kremlin's Strategy and Negotiations]].

Methods of pressure on Europe include:
*   **Gas Blackmail:** This is ongoing and considered "quite successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Economic Blackmail:** Aggravated economic problems due to rising energy prices are leading to domestic political crises in European countries, as seen in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Forceful Blackmail:** The operational meeting of the Security Council on July 15 had a closed part, from which leaks appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. These leaks, directed at "not friendly countries" in the West, allegedly discussed "extremely unpleasant and simply unpleasant for sensitive and dangerous measures of influence on Europe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Russia is using these leaks to hint at unused possibilities of forceful blackmail, hoping Europe will then increase pressure on Kyiv for reconciliation on Russian conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The information in these leaks, while spread, is not necessarily false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

These leaks also serve to warn Ukraine against a counteroffensive, which Ukrainian officials periodically discuss and which is reportedly scheduled for August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. According to current analytical assessments received by the Russian leadership, the threat of losing the Kherson region in the event of such a counteroffensive is "quite real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

## Preparation for Long Confrontation: Technological Sovereignty

While blackmailing the West, the [[Kremlins international relations and policies | Kremlin]] is also preparing for a long confrontation, reinforcing the idea of a "besieged fortress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This is reflected in Denis Manturov's statement in the State Duma about moving from a market economy strategy to a strategy of "technological sovereignty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This concept, in simple terms, means the "poetics of isolationism" and an attempt to create one's own base for high-tech product production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

However, the speaker notes that true technological sovereignty in an interdependent world has only been achieved by countries like North Korea and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. North Korea's technological development level is estimated to be around that of the USSR in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. The ideal of technological sovereignty for Russia is deemed "unattainable" due to severe limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

The person responsible for this goal is Manturov, who previously oversaw import substitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The results of import substitution policy have been dismal, with car production collapsing by 97% in May 2022, passenger buses by 77%, and other industrial sectors seeing significant declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The speaker predicts that technological sovereignty will follow a similar pattern, with immense money spent but effectively lost into a "black hole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

## Domestic Political Situation and Repressive Measures

Public opinion regarding the "special military operation" shows a significant divide:
*   Approximately one-third of Russians believe the operation must be stopped immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   Among young people aged 18-24, 56% are in favor of stopping, while only 19% support continuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   Among Internet users, 47% are in favor of stopping, versus 35% for continuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   Conversely, among respondents over 60 years old, 72% insist on continuing the "denazification of Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. For TV viewers, the majority supports continuing hostilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

In response to a lack of mass nationwide support for the operation, the [[Kremlin internal political dynamics | Kremlin]] is reinforcing its power through repressive policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. Recent amendments to the criminal code, signed by [[Putins strategic options in response to Western pressure | Putin]], include:
*   Public calls to action against Russia's security: up to 7 years in prison and a fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   Repeated propaganda or public demonstration of Nazi symbols or extremist organizations: up to 4 years in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. This applies to displaying logos of Facebook and Instagram, which are recognized as extremist organizations in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
*   Confidential cooperation with foreign countries: 2 to 8 years in prison with a fine of up to a million rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

These repressive amendments are adopted because there is no confidence in mass nationwide support for the "special military operation"; thus, apparent support must be "backed up with bayonets," or rather, legislative barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

## Upcoming Turbulence and Personal Outlook

The speaker expects an increase in political turbulence in August for two reasons:
1.  The armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine is likely to enter a new phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.
2.  Important decisions related to the transit of supreme power may be made within Russian politics, including the potential appearance of a new prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>.

There is also a possibility of mass mobilization (full or partial) in the fall, especially if Ukraine launches a successful counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

The speaker concludes by emphasizing the sharply increasing risks for anyone engaging in political commentary due to the new criminal code amendments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, which affects [[Kremlin internal political dynamics | Kremlin internal political dynamics]]. He may need to moderate or suspend his program, or change its format, to avoid danger from any independent commentary on news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Despite the gloomy outlook, he vows to remain in touch with his audience as long as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>, urging them to take care of themselves and support those protecting common sense, human dignity, and moral values in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. He ends with a message of hope: "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.

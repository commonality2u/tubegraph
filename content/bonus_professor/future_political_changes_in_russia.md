This article addresses questions regarding the [[potential_political_changes_in_russia_after_putin | future political landscape]] in Russia, focusing on the proposed "transit scheme," the roles of key figures, and the outlook for the country.

## The "Transit Scheme" and Political Transition

A theoretical "transit scheme" outlining a [[potential_political_changes_in_russia_after_putin | political transition]] was preliminarily agreed upon at the end of November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Nikolai Patrushev's Current Role
[[future_political_leadership_in_russia | Nikolai Patrushev]] is currently considered the supreme ruler of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This position resulted from a broad compromise and agreement among a wide coalition of elite groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This agreement is temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, as these groups wish to observe how [[future_political_leadership_in_russia | Patrushev]] conducts business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. They are not rushing to change supreme power immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> and may attempt to "replay" this agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Dmitry Patrushev as Potential Prime Minister
The elite groups also want to see how [[future_political_leadership_in_russia | Dmitry Patrushev]] will conduct business if he becomes prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. If Putin's double is elected president, they are obligated to appoint [[future_political_leadership_in_russia | Dmitry Patrushev]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, as the double would be under complete, absolute control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Mishustin's Limited Power
Mishustin, despite potentially becoming the interim head of state after the president's death, lacks significant power to initiate political or systemic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. He would not be given the authority to make major announcements or decisions, such as calling for early presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

### The Role of Putin's Double
It is stated that the president of Russia is not alive and has been replaced by a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Evidence cited includes a diametrically opposite change in behavior, appearance, becoming younger, more lively and cheerful, stopping hand tremors, hugging, kissing, and even becoming taller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. The double is younger and taller than the deceased president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The voice has also changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This information has reportedly been published in major Western and non-Western respectable publications and key news sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

When asked about the feasibility of such a similar double, it is noted that they did it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>, having prepared and trained for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. A special earpiece, a "spy VK," helps the person avoid major mistakes, though small mistakes are still made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. The original president's body is reportedly still in a "Valdai refrigerator" until transferred to better storage conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

If the double is elected president, he will be under complete control and will not be allowed to act independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. His freedom might increase somewhat, and he might try to play an independent game, but it is unlikely to succeed due to the elite's control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. During recent international meetings involving the double, no important documents were signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. The double is expected to congratulate the country on the New Year if no extraordinary events occur before then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

## Timeline and Manifestation of Crisis
The death of Putin will not be a liberation; the situation is expected to worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. It is predicted that the coming months will be more difficult than the COVID-19 pandemic or the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Putin's death is seen as a chance that must be seized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

Clear signs of a [[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | political crisis]] are expected within three months, possibly before the presidential elections in March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. It will take time for the crisis to fully manifest and influence the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Positive changes for Russia and Russian-Ukrainian relations are unlikely before autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.

Inflation is highly likely to get out of control next year, indicating a crisis stretched out in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

## International Perspectives on [[change_in_the_political_landscape_in_russia | Russia's Political Landscape]]
International actors like Western countries, Arab nations, Saudi Arabia, and China prioritize their own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. They are not interested in carrying out [[future_political_changes_and_developments_in_russia | Russia's internal changes]] or struggles, or bringing ideals of freedom, democracy, and justice to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. These countries view Russia skeptically, believing its people are partly to blame for their situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

The fundamental interest of the West is maintaining stability in Russia, regardless of the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. They are content with the current situation, finding it acceptable if not optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. Foreign leaders like Xi Jinping and Arab leaders meet with Putin's double because they are promised benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

## Post-Transition Vision for Russia

### Accountability and Justice
In a new Russia, many past issues, such as foreign currency mortgages, will need to be reviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>. Those who violated the law, betrayed the country and society, including the Ministry of Defense leadership (Shoigu, Gerasimov), will be held accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.

### Democracy vs. Socialism
The speaker believes that building a new socialism in Russia is not feasible, stating that old socialism was not good and ended badly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. In a new Russia, it should be possible to live prosperously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.

### Checks and Balances
It is deemed practically impossible for Russia to revert to a dictatorial path after [[social_and_political_changes_in_russia | the current transition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:52">[00:33:52]</a>. Mechanisms of checks and balances, both institutional and extra-institutional, will be implemented to prevent this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>. The goal is to put Russia on the "right track" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

## Other Related Discussions

### Mobilization and the [[future_challenges_in_russia | Special Military Operation]]
The possibility of a second wave of mobilization cannot be predicted, as it depends on the dynamics of the general and domestic political situation, and the Russian-Ukrainian confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. Russian troops are currently on the counterattack, with political goals to demonstrate offensive potential, create a favorable background for elections, and pressure the West to stimulate peace talks rather than provide aid to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>. It is unlikely that the Special Military Operation will end before autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.

The speaker expects that after the conflict, those who fought in Ukraine will likely face a similar fate to Soviet soldiers returning from Afghanistan, where they were effectively disavowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.

### The Role of Criminal Groups
Criminal groups cannot resist armed force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. The belief that criminal groups are under the full control of the current Russian government is a "deep and even pernicious misconception," as the situation is much more complicated and ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. The government's ability to use criminal groups in a crisis is doubted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

### Information Hygiene
Regarding information hygiene, it is difficult to find high-quality political analytics, especially from Telegram channels, which often lack adequate comprehensive coverage of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. The "General SVR" channel is noted as an informational and introductory source, not analytical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>. The speaker primarily seeks facts over opinions from news sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

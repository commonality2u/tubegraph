[[Valery Soloveys analysis of Vladimir Putins presidency | Valery Solovey]], in the tenth episode of his program "Answers to Hot Questions," recorded on January 11, 2023, addressed queries regarding [[Russian political dynamics and leadership issues | Vladimir Putin's]] decision-making process and the influence of his analytical staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Putin's Limited Choices

According to Solovey, [[Russian political dynamics and Putins public appearances | Putin]] currently faces a series of difficult choices concerning the ongoing military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>:
*   **Unbearable:** An attempt to use tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Very Bad:** Continuing the "special military operation" with an "unsuccessful hope of success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Simply Bad:** Admitting the "adventure has failed," declaring a unilateral ceasefire, and offering peace talks without preconditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

Solovey posits that [[role_and_perception_of_russian_leadership_and_power_structures | Putin]] will not choose the "simply bad" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## The Role of Analysts

A key question from the audience revolved around why [[role_and_perception_of_russian_leadership_and_power_structures | Putin]] does not have analysts advising him to halt the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Solovey asserts that [[russian_political_dynamics_and_putins_public_appearances | Vladimir Vladimirovich]] does possess a staff of "excellent analysts," primarily located at the Security Council base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. These individuals are described as having "highest analytical competencies" and have successfully and accurately predicted future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

However, despite the accuracy of their conclusions and the advice derived from their analytical notes, [[speculation_on_putins_health_and_the_future_of_putinism | Putin]] "categorically does not like it" and "does not share these analytical assessments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. He is described as attempting to "turn the tide of history" through the "effort of his senile weakening will of a sick seriously ill person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Solovey suggests that fate is "inexorable," and this will soon become apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### Public Understanding of Leadership

Solovey believes that some Russians do not understand where [[role_and_perception_of_russian_leadership_and_power_structures | Putin]] is leading them because they "do not want to understand," fearing the consequences of their own actions or certain policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Others may understand but remain silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Criteria for Governing Russia

In response to a question about a suitable successor if the president were to leave office, Solovey argued that effective governance in Russia does not require being a security officer or having multiple higher educations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>. Instead, the main criterion is to "at least love your homeland your people a little and wish them well and a good life," in contrast to "violence, theft, fraud and corruption on a universal scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. He invited listeners to consider for themselves whether individuals in the Russian president's entourage meet this criterion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

The era of [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Vladimir Putin]] is perceived by some as having ended, prompting a need to evaluate his actions and the trajectory of Russia since the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This assessment considers whether his era was one of "absolute evil or good or something mixed," who is to blame for the current situation, and if he was a "savior of the fatherland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

## Historical Perspective on Leadership Assessment

Historically, major politicians are judged based on the success or failure of their ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. A successful conclusion paints previous activities in a positive light, while an unsuccessful or disappointing end casts previous actions negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. The saying "the end of the matter is the crown" applies here, and [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin]]'s ending is clearly ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

## Early Presidency: Positive Perception and Favorable Conditions

No other Russian politician in history has led the country under more favorable conditions than [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Vladimir Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
These conditions included:
*   High oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   Absence of external enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   A benevolent attitude from the West, allowing Russia to receive loans and purchase technologies, which were used to rearm the armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

Society widely welcomed [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin]] after Yeltsin, viewing his ascension as the start of a new era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. He enjoyed support from both ordinary people and nearly all elite groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, receiving a "huge credit of trust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. The first eight years of his rule were perceived as justifying this trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

During this period, Russia's economy grew, and incomes rose, allowing people to experience a quality of life similar to Western prosperity for the first time in 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. This manifested in everyday things like changing iPhones annually, traveling to foreign resorts beyond Turkey (e.g., France, Spain), and buying apartments or building country houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. Despite degradation in the regions, the overall standard of living improved significantly from the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. People perceived [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Putin]]'s actions through the lens of their national interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. Even restrictions on political freedoms and increasingly non-competitive elections did not provoke widespread protest in the early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

## Shift in Public Perception and Negative Assessment

The public's view began to change around 2011, notably during the Bolotnaya Square protests, when people felt deceived by the "castling" of [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin]] and Medvedev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. A natural "psychological fatigue from the rulers" sets in after 8 to 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. If [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin]] had left office in 2008, he would have been remembered as "the greatest statesman" who "raised Russia from its knees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.

However, the current assessment is largely negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
Historians will likely view [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin]] as someone who "missed a unique historical chance to ensure the rapid development of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. This chance was exchanged for:
*   The growth of wealth for a group of his friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
*   "Cheap, incomprehensible projects" like the Olympic Games, which were the most expensive in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

### Deteriorating Social Position and Policies
For six consecutive years, people's incomes have been declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. This has led to "colossal irritation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>, as no country would keep a government for six years if it failed to cope with a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. The reappointment of the same government, headed by a universally disliked figure, coupled with the "mockery" of pension reform (raising retirement age when many men don't live to 60) further intensified public negative sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

The initial popularity boost from Crimea only temporarily delayed the rating decline that began in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. The long-term negative experience means [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin]]'s figure will be increasingly viewed negatively in mass consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.

### Mismanagement and Corruption
Russia received vast amounts of money from the sale of raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. A tenth of this money could have provided everyone with normal, quality housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. However, colossal amounts of money were lost, taken out to offshore accounts, or spent on unproductive and "stupid projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:19:00">[19:19:00]</a>. This mismanagement meant that ordinary people were denied a better life, not living like Germany, but at least "no worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:34:00">[19:34:00]</a>. The "crap" sold as provisions in Russian stores, even in Moscow, is seen as an "insult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>.

The reliance on raw materials corrupted both the elite and part of the population, leading to a lazy approach to development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>. The elite, often security officers or former colleagues from St. Petersburg, imagined themselves "masters of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:00]</a>, treating people "like serfs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>.

## Deformation of [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin's Personality]]
[[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Putin]] himself is convinced that everything he did was "absolutely right" and that it was "impossible to act differently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. This conviction is a clear indicator of a "deformation of the personality" that occurs when a person is at the top of power for almost 20 years, relieved of competition and public criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.

He lives in an "information cocoon," a "sterile information space" where "everything is fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>. This isolation means he is out of touch with the reality of people's lives, such as those earning 10,000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a>. He is also described as being "afraid" to make decisions during crises and to "look into the eyes of those unfortunate people" who become victims of attacks or disasters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:48:00">[22:48:00]</a>, leading him to surround himself with an increasing number of security guards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:00">[23:01:00]</a>.

[[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin]] has a "pronounced messianic complex," believing he is an "outstanding statesman" and the "largest world leader of the early 21st century" who "raised Russia from its knees," with God having "given him to Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>.

## Criticism of the Current Government and State System
The state system is seen as inefficient and failing to perform its functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:00">[25:38:00]</a>. Problems like the nationwide garbage crisis persist despite allocated funds, with solutions involving filling roads with garbage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:00">[31:14:00]</a>. There's a "patch-up" mentality instead of long-term planning, particularly concerning complex technological systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:55:00">[31:55:00]</a>. Money is concentrated in Moscow for superficial improvements like laying tiles, which is an "insult" to people in other cities and villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>.

The government makes decisions that spoil relations with society, such as the ban on flights to Georgia, viewing citizens as "ignorant children" who cannot decide for themselves where to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:27:00">[33:27:00]</a>. This constant creation of enemies by the authorities is seen as an "amazing talent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:38:00">[34:38:00]</a>.

## Future Political Transition and Potential Leadership
The current political situation is "turbulent" and unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:17:00">[25:17:00]</a>. A political transition is likely to be "risky" and "not go at all as planned in the Kremlin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:00]</a>. There is too much accumulated contradiction for a smooth transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:46:00">[26:46:00]</a>.

No single force in Russia can rule alone; a broad coalition or "civil alliance" will be necessary, uniting liberals, leftists, nationalists, and social democrats around a simple, shared program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:07:00">[35:07:00]</a>. Liberals are seen as having the best chances, not due to popularity, but because they control "information" and media, possess "developed ideas and plans" for economic transformation, and occupy key positions in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:00">[36:02:00]</a>. Their rhetoric will need to be social, focusing on "justice," "equality before the law," and "respect for human dignity" to gain broad support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:48:00">[36:48:00]</a>.

The "left mood" in Russia is primarily about people wanting to "take revenge on the masters of life," not about strong solidarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:47:00">[37:47:00]</a>. Russian society is described as "very individualistic," not communal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:04:00">[38:04:00]</a>. Liberal (even libertarian) ideas align with this individualism, as many do not want state interference and prefer self-regulating organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:17:00">[38:17:00]</a>. Attempts by the left to seize power through armed groups (like 1917 or Venezuela) are unlikely to work in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:37:00">[38:37:00]</a>.

Current Russia is "completely different" from early 20th-century Russia, being largely urbanized and culturally integrated into the global world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:35:00">[40:35:00]</a>. It is argued that Russia is "just a liberal country" and this should be accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:12:00">[41:12:00]</a>. While social democratic parties might emerge in a fair parliamentary competition, radical left movements are unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:17:00">[41:17:00]</a>.

Idealists, not just those motivated by material gain, should lead the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:41:00">[44:41:00]</a>. The problem of corporations merging with the state, where profit becomes the sole goal, is seen as a manifestation of fascism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:33:00">[45:33:00]</a>, leading to human development fading into the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:51:00">[45:51:00]</a>. While a liberal economy increases national wealth, ensuring justice and redistribution is crucial, especially regarding severe regional disparities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:31:00">[46:31:00]</a>. Moscow's "octopus" effect, sucking resources from other regions, is "destroying the country" and its unity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:37:00">[48:37:00]</a>.

## Key Reforms Needed in Russia
To avoid collapse, several key reforms are necessary:
1.  **Freedom for small and medium businesses:** This can be achieved quickly by removing restrictions and canceling certain laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50:00">[49:50:00]</a>.
2.  **Complete reform of the judicial and legal system:** Essential for justice, as currently, "there is actually no court" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:03:00">[50:03:00]</a>. This may require a "total lustration" of the judicial corps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:17:00">[51:17:00]</a>.
3.  **Long-term reforms:** Healthcare and school reforms will take 10 to 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:16:00">[50:16:00]</a>.

Before any reforms, it is suggested to "close exit from the Russian Federation for all officials and members of their families" for a definite time, with exceptions only for official delegations, to conduct an inventory and lustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:35:00">[50:35:00]</a>.

The most important goal is to ensure a "peaceful way" for reforms and changes to happen, avoiding civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:31:00">[51:31:00]</a>. The state should serve society, not the other way around, focusing on "the education of a new person" and "new personnel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:05:00">[52:05:00]</a>.

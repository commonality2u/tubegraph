## Context: Public Opinion and the 'Special Military Operation'

According to closed surveys, approximately a third of Russians, slightly less than 30%, are confident that the special military operation must be stopped immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. In some age categories, the number of people advocating for its immediate termination prevails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Among young people aged 18 to 24, 56% are in favor of stopping the operation, while only 19% support its continuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. For those aged 25-34, 43% favor continuation, and 41% prefer stopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

Conversely, the majority insisting on continuing the "denazification" of Ukraine are respondents over 60 years old, with 72% in favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

A significant dependence is observed among Internet users: 47% are in favor of stopping the special operation, while 35% support continuing hostilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. For TV viewers, where television is the primary news source, the situation is the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. The speaker notes that while the internet is not yet defeating television, the Russian state aids television through its [[repression_and_political_arrests_in_russia | repressive policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

## New Repressive Legislation

The President of the Russian Federation recently signed amendments to the criminal code, significantly [[impact_of_new_laws_in_russia | impacting civil liberties]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>:
*   **Public calls to action against Russia's security**: Punishable by up to 7 years in prison and a fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Repeated propaganda or public demonstration of Nazi symbols or extremist organizations**: Punishable by up to 4 years in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. This law extends to businesses with logos of Facebook or Instagram, which are recognized as extremist organizations in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.
*   **Confidential cooperation with foreign countries**: Carries a penalty of 2 to 8 years in prison with a fine of up to one million rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. The speaker highlights the arbitrary nature, suggesting that even meeting and talking with foreign friends could be interpreted as confidential cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

## The Purpose of Repression

These [[russian_legal_and_penal_system_reforms | repressive amendments to the criminal code]] are being adopted because there is no confidence in mass, nationwide support for the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. Therefore, this "apparent support" must be backed up not with bayonets, but with "barrier detachments" in the form of legislative amendments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

## Personal Impact and Future Outlook

The speaker acknowledges that the signed amendments to the criminal code mean that risks are sharply increasing for anyone making [[current_and_potential_future_restrictions_in_russia | political commentary]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. They may have to moderate their activity, potentially suspending or changing the format of their program for two to three weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Any independent commentary on news is deemed dangerous for the commentator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

The speaker urges vigilance and continued activity in the moral and psychological sense, advising not to relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. They emphasize the importance of supporting those in Russia who are trying to protect common sense, human dignity, and [[moral_and_social_degradation_in_russia | civilizational and moral values]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.

This article provides an overview of Russia's internal political dynamics and challenges, as discussed in the 25th episode of Valery Soloviev's program "What's Happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The episode, recorded on Sunday, September 18, and released on Monday, September 19, focuses on recent events impacting [[Russian sociopolitical dynamics | Russia's sociopolitical dynamics]] and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Key Challenges and Failures

The program highlights several significant issues affecting [[internal political dynamics and challenges in Russia | Russia's internal political dynamics]], particularly following the Samarkand summit. The summit was characterized as a "failure" for Russia and President Putin across four key aspects: image/symbolic, geopolitical, economic, and physiological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Symbolic and Image Failures

*   **Diminished Status:** Unlike previous instances where other leaders waited for him, President Putin was met by the Prime Minister of Uzbekistan, while other state presidents were met by the Uzbek President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Furthermore, Putin had to wait for four heads of state: India, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Kyrgyzstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Perceived Weakness:** A notable photograph from the summit depicted Turkish President Erdogan and Azerbaijani President Aliyev seated centrally in chairs, while Putin sat on a sofa between the presidents of Belarus and Tajikistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Submissive Posture:** The Indian Prime Minister adopted a didactic tone with Putin, who "made excuses" for the ongoing conflict in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Chinese President Xi Jinping reportedly reacted with an "ironic grin" and shook his head in "obvious distrust" when Putin stated that everything in Ukraine was "going according to plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Geopolitical Decline

*   **Loss of Influence:** China and Turkey are increasingly asserting influence in the post-Soviet space, which the Kremlin traditionally considered its exclusive domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Kazakhstan's Autonomy:** Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly declared China as a guarantor of Kazakhstan's sovereignty and territorial integrity, a move that subtly undermined Russia's traditional role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Kazakhstan's president also demonstratively avoided communication with Putin at the summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Regional Conflicts and CSTO:** The conflict between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan initially did not turn to Moscow for mediation, with Putin having to offer his services later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. In the Armenia-Azerbaijan conflict, Russia's support for Armenia was conditional on Armenia joining a "union state," excluding the contested region of Karabakh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **CSTO Collapse:** Kazakhstan has indicated it will suspend its membership in the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) from next year, signaling the alliance's potential collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This leaves Armenia questioning its continued membership given the lack of support for its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Alternative Influences:** The United States is emerging as an alternative influence in the South Caucasus, challenging Russia's traditional dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Economic Limitations

*   **Lack of Offers:** Putin had little to offer summit participants beyond resources, lacking influence or military aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **China's Independence:** China, a primary consumer of Russian resources, showed no interest in a proposed "Power of Siberia 2" gas pipeline through Mongolia, with Comrade Xi ironically shaking his head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### Physiological Concerns

*   **Putin's Health:** Many observers at the summit noted President Putin's "terrible physical and mental shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. A mini-video reportedly showed Erdogan carefully supporting Putin's elbow to help him maintain pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Summit-level loads are said to be beyond Putin's physical and mental capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Medical Attention:** Reports indicate that 12 doctors waited for Putin at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Unstable Statements:** Putin's "strange statements" and mannerisms suggest underlying issues, which are being observed by "dozens and hundreds of attentive, trained eyes" who are mostly "unfriendly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

## Military and Domestic Challenges

### Situation in Ukraine

*   **Ukrainian Offensive:** Ukrainian forces are on the offensive, while Russian forces are exclusively defensive, indicating a struggle for strategic initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The successful Ukrainian counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region is seen as the "beginning of a turning point" in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Russian Deficiencies:** The Russian army lacks forces, means, modern equipment, and overall equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Critically, there is a deficit of "moral and volitional qualities," a "lack of faith in Victory," and no understanding of the conflict's meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. This moral deficit is growing and could lead to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Sabotage and Abandonment:** Ukrainian offensive actions are accompanied by successful sabotage and "terrorist attacks" against those cooperating with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. The hasty withdrawal of Russian forces from the Kharkiv region has caused doubts among potential collaborators, especially after the official stated "Russia is here forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. This disbelief and moral deficit extend to the civilian population in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

### Domestic Responses and Dissent

*   **Penal Battalions:** Following the Kharkiv defeat, the idea of using prisoners to participate in armed actions, reminiscent of penal companies in 1942, gained traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. This move is seen as an admission that the Russian Federation "cannot or does not want to carry out mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>. Penal battalions are not considered a decisive force in war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   **Opposition to Mobilization:** Two key security officers, Patrushev and Bortnikov, reportedly spoke out harshly against mobilization, including partial mobilization, despite having developed a mobilization plan earlier in the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Their objection signals a significant increase in security risks and a reaction to the "political and physiological weakening of the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.
*   **Elite's Dilemma:** The [[Russian internal political dynamics | Russian elite]] is increasingly questioning how to exit the current situation without losing face, or how to "crawl out" of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. Ukraine's condition for negotiations – complete liberation of all Ukrainian territories, including Crimea – is "absolutely unacceptable" to the Russian leadership, as it would mean "complete and final fiasco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.
*   **US Shift in Strategy:** The United States has unilaterally withdrawn from consultations with Russia regarding ending military actions, having formed a consensus that a "decisive military defeat" must be inflicted on Russia to achieve "political change in the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

## [[Potential changes in Russias political landscape | Potential Changes in Russia's Political Landscape]]

### Elite's Discontent with Putin

*   **Desire for Putin's Disappearance:** A growing sentiment within the Russian elite is the desire for Vladimir Putin to "suddenly disappear somewhere," taking "all responsibility" for the special military operation and the negative developments in Russia over the past 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. This suggests a desire to reset the political situation without direct responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

### Assassination Attempt and Power Transition

*   **Assassination Attempt:** An assassination attempt on Putin was reported by a well-known Telegram channel and picked up by Western media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. Rumors of this event circulated even earlier in September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
*   **"Public Warning":** The attempt is not seen as a "fatal swing" but rather a "public warning" from forces indicating their ability to "reach" Putin and possibly hint at demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.
*   **Legalistic Departure:** An alternative to such radical actions is the "gradual departure of the Russian president in a completely legalistic way," involving retirement from power, transfer of supreme power, and his move into the shadows, from where he hopes to rule Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
*   **Formation of State Council:** A "small and effective" State Council, analogous to the Soviet one, is reportedly already formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. Its work is expected to begin, with information possibly published before the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

## Accelerating Deterioration

The speaker emphasizes that "time has begun to speed up" in Russia since February 24, with changes happening "extremely quickly" and affecting "institutions," "circumstances," and "any of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. The "drama and speed of these changes will increase" this autumn, and they will be "changes for the worse," likely occurring "spasmodically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. This deterioration will primarily be political, though it will certainly affect the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.

The armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine, as of April 18, 2022, has become the central focus of Russian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The current period is seen as approaching the culmination of the armed confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Reasons for Conflict Culmination

From the Russian side, the Kremlin has failed to achieve its initial combat missions or political goals in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This is further highlighted by the unexplained sinking of the cruiser Varyag, vague official statements, and the lack of declared mourning for the dead, which creates a "painful impression" and questions the effectiveness of the "limited special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. The Russian leadership is perceived to be in need of a strategic turning point on the fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Conversely, Ukraine, supported by the West, has gained momentum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. President Zelensky and the Ukrainian leadership do not intend to meet Russia's "ultimatum demands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The West publicly states that the "fate of the peace talks will be decided on the battlefield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, and Ukraine believes it is capable of inflicting "significant damage on Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Symptoms of Escalation

Key symptoms of the approaching culmination include:
*   **Russian troop concentration** Russian forces are concentrating in Donbass with the aim of creating a "cauldron" for the Armed Forces of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Western military aid** The West is rapidly sending advanced "complex and strike weapons" to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Battle of Donbass** This impending battle is considered by all parties as the key event of the confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Lack of Russian confidence** Information from senior Russian military sources indicates a lack of confidence in achieving victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Intense confrontation** The confrontation is expected to be "extremely fierce" due to increasing bitterness between the parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## High Risk of Escalation

The risk of escalation in the conflict is considered "very high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Potential Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction
If Russia fails to achieve its military objectives or political goals (forcing Ukraine to sign a peace on favorable terms), the risks of using [[strategic_military_resources_and_international_negotiations | weapons of mass destruction]] increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This includes "low-yield tactical nuclear weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, a possibility discussed by American military and intelligence sources, including the head of the CIA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. [[strategic_military_resources_and_international_negotiations | Weapons of mass destruction]] also imply chemical and bacteriological weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Representatives of the Russian Ministry of Defense and self-proclaimed republics constantly hint at potential Ukrainian provocations involving chemical weapons, which are seen as "transparent hints" of a potential escalation mechanism by the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Interrupting Supply Chains
There is a temptation for Russia to interrupt Western arms supplies to Ukraine, possibly using tactical nuclear weapons to strike logistical chains on Ukrainian territory or in neighboring countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Discussions regarding this possibility are ongoing in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Strikes on Russian Territory
Another escalation mechanism involves the Ukrainian side striking military and civilian targets in Russian regions adjacent to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Ukraine is expected to receive missiles capable of reaching Russian military airfields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Terrorist Attacks
Terrorist attacks in Moscow and other large Russian cities are presented as a potential trigger for escalation, with vague hints appearing in official Russian media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

The global situation is described as "very close, very reminiscent of the Cuban Missile Crisis," possibly "even more acute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Possible Outcomes of the Conflict

Assuming the most dangerous option of widespread conflict is avoided, three possibilities for future developments are outlined:
1.  **Peace Treaty:** Based on the positions of both sides, a peace treaty is currently deemed "not a very big possibility" due to Russia's "unrealizable" demands and Ukraine's firm stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
2.  **[[Military truce and geopolitical shifts | Truce]] (Cessation of Hostilities):** This would involve a cessation of hostilities, which could be partial or full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
3.  **Continuation of Sluggish Military Actions:** A [[military_truce_and_geopolitical_shifts | truce]] could be combined with ongoing positional battles, leading to "sluggish military actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This state could last until at least the fall of 2022, or potentially until the end of the year, according to American sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Internal Russian Dynamics

### Blame and Purges
The failure of the initial "limited military operation" concept has led to blame being placed on subordinates, particularly those who provided misleading information to the president about Ukraine's readiness to "collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Among those implicated are:
*   **Minister of Defense Shuryga:** Described as having "fallen into disgrace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   **Former head of the 5th Service of the FSB:** This service was responsible for operational information on Ukraine and behind-the-scenes preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The head of this service is reportedly in a pre-trial detention center, subjected to physical abuse, with a group of officers giving confessions under duress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   **Main Directorate of the General Staff (GRU):** Also facing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

There is no "conspiracy" or "split in the elite," but rather "tension and disorganization" within the security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This will increase as a "purge" is expected once the [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_Russia | special military operation]] concludes, with "culprits" to be named and punished in the Russian manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### Impact on Bureaucracy and Big Business
Tension and disorganization will also increase among the top bureaucracy and big business due to:
*   **Impending purges** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.
*   **Strengthening sanctions** Western sanctions are expected to become "more and more sensitive" and difficult for the Russian economy, leading to "technological degradation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **Asset nationalization discussions** Conversations have revived among Russia's security environment and those close to the president about nationalizing large assets of private corporations, especially as Russian oligarchs' assets abroad are being seized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

Overall, the situation in Russia is exhibiting "barely noticeable signs of the hatization of the security forces," marked by "fears, confusion," and a lack of clear direction from the highest elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. The current era, often called the "Putin era," is "coming to an end," and it is unlikely to be triumphant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

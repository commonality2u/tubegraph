From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Valery Solovey's program, "What is Happening," discussed the dynamics of [[chinese_influence_on_russian_politics | Chinese influence on Russian politics]], particularly in the context of the [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | Ukraine-Russia conflict]]. The central event covered was the trip of the "so-called president" (allegedly a double, Evgeny Vasilyevich) to Beijing, seen as seeking a "label for reigning" from the Chinese Bogdykhan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## Moscow's Objectives in Beijing

The Kremlin's goals for the Beijing visit reportedly included:
*   **Legitimization of the Double**: To gain international acceptance for the "double" as president, by China accepting him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
*   **Influence on Ukraine Summit**: To ask China to pressure the Russian Federation not to participate in the Swiss summit on [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
*   **Continued Military Support**: To obtain guarantees of ongoing Chinese support for military operations against [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. It was stated that if China stopped providing Russia with dual-use products, Russian military actions would subside within months, and the Russian economy would collapse within six months, highlighting the critical importance of Chinese aid both militarily and economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   **Bank Payment Resolution**: To resolve issues with bank payments stuck in or returned by Chinese banks, which significantly slow down mutual trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.
*   **Gas Pipeline Consent**: To secure China's consent for the "Power of Siberia 2" gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

## Beijing's Objectives and the "Secret Agreement"

Beijing's primary goals for the visit were:
*   **Assessment of Russian Leadership**: To observe the "new composition" of the Russian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **Implementation of Secret Treaty**: To understand Moscow's readiness to fulfill a "secret agreement" signed by the "late" Russian President Vladimir Putin with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in February 2022, on the eve of the Beijing Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

### Details of the Secret Agreement
According to the speaker, this secret agreement, hidden from the general Russian society, grants China a 49-year lease of "gigantic territories" in Siberia and the Far East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. This lease includes the right to develop natural resources and organize administration, effectively placing these territories under Chinese control in a political and legal sense, meaning they "actually leave the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>.

This agreement was allegedly the price "late" President Putin was willing to pay for China's support for the "notorious special military operation," which was intended as a "victorious blitzkrieg" but became "protracted military actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. The speaker calls this agreement an "act of national treason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

China sought assurance that Russia was ready to implement this treaty, which is scheduled to take practical effect on January 1, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. The Kremlin, conversely, tried to postpone the treaty's effect due to fears of a "monstrous scandal and domestic political crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. The Chinese did not agree to postpone it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.

## The Humiliating Visit

The speaker characterized Russia's position during the visit as a "supplicant," with China acting as a "master" looking down on Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. China gave no definitive "yes" or "no" to the "humiliated request" from the Russian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

### Agreements and Symbolism
During the visit, "not very significant but very important from a symbolic point of view" agreements were signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. One such agreement concerned cooperation on Bolshoy Usuriysky Island, formally divided between the two countries but considered "completely its own" by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. Chinese maps show the entire island as Chinese, and the Russian side reportedly "does not protest against this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. This was interpreted as a hint that the Kremlin is ready to accept the secret agreement, even with the risk of scandal and internal political crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

The speaker noted that two "real masters of the Russian land," Sergei Chemezov and Nikolai Patrushev, did not go to Beijing, unwilling to be associated with the "humiliating requests" and "insults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. The legitimization of the double was described as a scene of "colossal, unprecedented humiliation" for the entire Russian delegation and Russia itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

### The "One-on-One" Meeting
The "one-on-one meeting" between the "so-called President Putin" and Xi Jinping was described as not truly one-on-one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>. Beyond a translator, "people who controlled the double from the Russian side" were present to prevent him from saying anything "unnecessary" or "idiotic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. During this meeting, "nothing was discussed" except "praises of wisdom, strength, and strong-willed dignity of the Chinese leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>.

Chinese press reports on the "partnership without borders" from the visit were also described as lacking specifics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. Despite Russia's goal to prevent Chinese participation in the Swiss summit on [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]], China stated immediately after the meeting that it would "not mind sending a delegation to Switzerland," though not headed by Xi Jinping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.

## Outcome of the Visit

In summary, the visit led only to "some very modest legitimization of the double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>. The speaker considers the outcome "offensive to Russia," common sense, and national dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>. The visit's overall result was deemed "frankly dangerous for Russia" because its "territorial integrity and national sovereignty" have been called into question due to the secret treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:00">[16:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:55:00">[16:55:00]</a>. The current Russian leadership is reportedly "at least in part" ready to implement this act of "national treason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>.

No significant decisions were made on key Russian requests:
*   No decision on bank payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>.
*   No decision on the Power of Siberia gas pipeline project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>.
*   Chinese commentary on [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Ukraine]] was "more than laconic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>.

Chinese officials showed "noticeable interest" in the personality of Belousov, seeing him as a "possible new strong man" with whom they might do business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. Belousov's personal attitude towards China is reportedly "restrained suspicious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>. The appointment of Belousov is described as the result of a "fantastic coincidence" or "skillfully conducted intrigues," indicating a "new alignment within Russian politics" and "within the elite balance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:22:00">[15:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.

The speaker announced that future discussions would delve into the "true background of Russian politics" and the plans of Russia's governors, including a prediction that Mishustin will resign soon, leading to a "radical renewal of the Cabinet of Ministers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:00">[17:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a>. These upcoming events are described as "very important" and will "undoubtedly shake Russia," also concerning [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Russian-Ukrainian relations]] and confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:00">[20:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:12:00">[20:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:17:00">[20:17:00]</a>.

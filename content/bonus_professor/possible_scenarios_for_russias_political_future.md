From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The [[russian_political_landscape_and_potential_changes | Russian political landscape]] is described as entering a "new reality" and the beginning of a new historical era, with "Putin's era is over" [00:10:53]. This transition is currently not very noticeable to the overwhelming majority, but movement towards a new era has begun [00:24:31]. The speaker affirms that "Putin is not alive" [00:07:35].

## Key Players and Power Dynamics

### Nikolai Patrushev
Nikolai Patrushev and a group supporting him are seen as part of a "new government" [00:01:21]. Patrushev is described as the "supreme ruler of Russia" [00:08:19]. He is also heavily involved in discussions and pushing the option of transferring power to his son, Dmitry Patrushev [00:08:14]. Patrushev is largely considered to be behind the persecution of Alexei Navalny [00:13:49]. If Patrushev feels his group's power is threatened by the West, he may consider using nuclear weapons [00:17:34].

### Dmitry Patrushev
Dmitry Patrushev is considered a potential future president [00:15:45]. He is young and belongs to a new generation, accustomed to luxury and enjoying life under the shadow of influential and rich parents [00:15:54]. While described as "not evil" [00:16:15], the speaker has doubts about his ability to become an effective manager of Russia, as it would require destroying the basis of the Putin system and replacing it with new ones [00:16:32].

### Ramzan Akhmatovich (Kadyrov)
Ramzan Akhmatovich's influence in the North Caucasus is unlikely to be significantly less than that of the federal center [00:03:12], which causes "very strong irritation" [00:03:16]. The speaker considers the possibility of Kadyrov's march on Moscow, which could lead to civil war and the collapse of Russia, to have "insignificant" probability, but does not reject it, stating that "almost everything is possible" in Russia [00:14:13].

## Potential Changes in Governance

### Presidential vs. Parliamentary Republic
A parliamentary republic will not be established in Russia, at least not for the transitional period [00:14:45]. It will be necessary to introduce transitional norms into a New Constitution [00:14:51]. After ten or twelve years, a referendum should be held on whether to move to a parliamentary form of government or remain with a presidential republic [00:14:54].

### Future President
The speaker has a favorite candidate for future president but declines to name this person [00:15:05]. The essential qualities for a future president are identified as:
1.  Love for the Motherland and its people [00:15:19].
2.  Presence of common sense [00:15:27].

### Putin's Succession and Double
The speaker asserts that "Putin is not alive" [00:07:35] and died of cancer [00:07:58]. "Vasilich," identified as Putin's double, is currently acting as president [00:08:02]. The option of using Vasilich to transfer power is "intensively discussed and pushed by Nikolai Patrushev" [00:08:12], specifically for transferring power to his son [00:08:21]. However, Vasilich himself is wary of this [00:08:26].

## Other Political Considerations

### Alexei Navalny
Alexei Navalny, described as a "personal enemy of Putin and political prisoner" [00:13:35], will be released as soon as the [[possible_future_political_changes_in_russia | political situation in Russia]] begins to change radically [00:13:39]. Patrushev's government will not release Navalny [00:13:46].

### Exiled Citizens
Those who left Russia temporarily to avoid being sent to the front can only return "without fear" after the start of the political crisis [00:30:36]. This is because the possibility of a new mobilization remains very high [00:30:46]. While returning might be necessary for financial reasons or family, individuals should be prepared for potential difficulties like closed borders during mobilization [00:31:01].

### Accountability and Transparency
Lists of informers and provocateurs who collaborated with the current regime will be published [00:32:02]. This includes those who informed on fellow citizens since the 1930s (excluding those working in the interests of national security) [00:32:10], as well as modern informers and trolls [00:32:39]. This aims to prevent such actions from happening again [00:32:53]. Individuals like Mizulina Jr. from the "League of Safe Internet" will be held responsible if they violated articles of the Criminal Code [00:31:48].

### End of Military Actions in Ukraine
The speaker believes that a truce in Ukraine, "perhaps not a lasting final peace, but a truce," will be achieved next year [00:09:36]. The "Kissinger plan," which suggests Ukraine becoming a NATO member without Russian-occupied territories, is mentioned as a potential path forward, supported by influential Western officials [00:10:06]. However, this plan lacks the political will of Ukraine and the support of Ukrainian society [00:10:21].

### Nuclear War Probability
The speaker indicates that if Patrushev feels a threat to his power from the West, he "will think about using nuclear weapons" [00:17:34]. The level of nuclear anxiety is not specifically rated as increasing or decreasing but tied to Patrushev's perceived threats [00:17:50].

## Societal Changes
The current state of "stupefaction and debilization" among the population due to propaganda can be overcome if the propaganda machine is destroyed. The overwhelming majority would begin to "come to their senses" in a few months [00:19:02]. The speaker notes that the current situation is "already ending" in political and historical terms [00:24:26]. The goal of the speaker's plans for Russia's [[possible_future_political_changes_in_russia | political future]] is "freedom and justice for Russia, law for all and justice for everyone" [00:35:34].

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

A clarification was issued regarding an earlier statement about articles within the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Originally, it was stated that Article 357 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation pertained to the violent seizure and retention of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This was an error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Corrected Information

*   Article 357 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation actually addresses genocide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   The correct article concerning the violent seizure and retention of power is Article 278 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

The speaker expressed gratitude to those who brought this mistake to their attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

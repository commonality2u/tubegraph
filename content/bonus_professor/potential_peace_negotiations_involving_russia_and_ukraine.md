Valery Solovey's program, "What is Happening," discussed the intricate dynamics surrounding [[peace_negotiations_with_ukraine | potential peace negotiations]] between Russia and Ukraine, with a significant focus on the role of U.S. presidential elections and former President Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## U.S. Elections and Their Global Impact

The presidential elections in the United States are considered the "most important elections in the world," profoundly influencing international relations and prospects for peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Many countries, particularly those interacting with the U.S. or U.S.-led alliances, react to these elections and base their foreign policy on the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Despite the U.S. no longer holding the same unquestioning leadership role it did in previous decades, its leading position remains significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The Russian leadership, in particular, calibrates its domestic and international policy based on the American election outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Initial Russian Outreach to Trump

Following the U.S. elections on November 6, two Russian elite coalitions, led by Chemezov and Patrushev, extended "enthusiastic congratulations" to Donald Trump via informal channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Trump responded to both messages, referring to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as an "incident" that it was time to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This characterization suggests Trump's foreign policy views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Proposal for a Truce

Included in at least one of these messages was a proposal for a "truce" rather than immediate peace, envisioned as a necessary preliminary stage for the beginning of [[peace_negotiations_with_ukraine | peace negotiations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. For more details on the substance and desired timeframe of this truce proposal from the Russian side, a speech given on November 7 is referenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Kremlin's Vision for Peace

The [[kremlins_view_on_peace_with_ukraine | Kremlin's view on peace with Ukraine]] and the contours of a settlement were outlined during a conversation between Trump and the "so-called president of Russia" (Putin's double) on November 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This conversation, reported by the Washington Post, revealed the following territorial proposals from the Kremlin:
*   Crimea remains on the Russian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   Donetsk and Luhansk regions, within their administrative borders, remain on the Russian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   Ukraine would cede the Kursk region in exchange for Russia giving up fragments of territories it controls in the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

Crucially, the Kremlin softened its previous stance on a land corridor to Crimea. While the Russian side had previously insisted on retaining a land corridor to Crimea, during this conversation, they indicated a willingness to abandon this demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This concession would be contingent on Ukraine guaranteeing "unimpeded transit of goods and people" from mainland Russia to the Crimean peninsula through Ukrainian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Trump's Response and Challenges

Trump's initial reaction to these proposals was a pause, stating he could not immediately comment and would need to consider and discuss them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The leak of this conversation suggests that certain individuals within Trump's circle might view the proposals as unrealistic or undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

While Trump's worldview might see Ukraine in a "subordinate position" influenced by commercial logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, his powers as president are not absolute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. He would need to contend with one-party officials, especially those in key positions like Secretary of State or Assistant to the President for National Security, who may hold different views on the [[russianukrainian_relations_and_the_prospect_of_war | confrontation between Russia and Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. The "Deep State," or Washington bureaucracy, previously blocked some of Trump's initiatives in his first term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### Trump's Motivation for Peace

As this would be his last term, Trump is believed to desire "epochal" achievements, both domestically and internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. He has expressed a desire to act as a peacemaker, aiming to "stop the long bloodshed" and potentially secure the Nobel Peace Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. His economic-centric policy drives an incentive to establish peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. As president of the most powerful country, Trump has the potential to influence, and if necessary, pressure both sides of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## The Role of Putin's Double in Negotiations

The transcript highlights that the "so-called Putin" who spoke at the Valdai Forum and held the conversation with Trump was a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This double, described as "not very educated" and "not very smart," exhibited numerous slips of the tongue and difficulty pronouncing words during an hour-long speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. This suggests a "serious root cause" and inability to overcome intellectual challenges despite rehearsals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. It is further mentioned that the double's "career as president of Russia is ending," as Politburo 2 has decided to terminate this "tragicomic" role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Despite promises of a quiet, secure life, the double is reportedly worried about his survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>.

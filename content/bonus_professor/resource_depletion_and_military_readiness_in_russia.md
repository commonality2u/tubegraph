The pace of the Russian military offensive continues, albeit not at a high rate, and the armed forces remain difficult to stop, with fierce battles ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Russia has adopted a new strategy, referred to as the "salami tactic," involving the gradual "gnawing off" of Ukrainian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This tactic relies on achieving superiority in one direction, primarily the Luhansk region, before moving to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Currently, 20% of Ukrainian territory is under Russian control, compared to 7% (including Crimea) before February 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This represents an operational and tactical success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Resource Depletion and Military Readiness

Despite territorial gains, there is growing evidence of resource exhaustion affecting Russia's military readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

### Indicators of Depletion
*   **Abolition of Age Limits** The age limit for signing the first military contract was recently abolished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   **Outdated Equipment** Russia is mothballing T-62 tanks, which are described as "completely outdated models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Recruitment Efforts** There are unconfirmed reports of military enlistment offices in Dagestan, specifically Makhachkala, forcibly searching for young people aged 18 to 27 to "clarify their documents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. While not explicitly [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_Russia | conscription]], this suggests efforts to replenish personnel.

These actions collectively indicate that Russia's resources are being exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

### Implications for Peace Negotiations

The Kremlin seeks a "break" or "truce" in the conflict, interpreting peace as a ceasefire rather than a return of troops to their pre-February 24th positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This ceasefire is seen as "extremely beneficial for the Kremlin" because it would allow time to regroup forces, bring up new contingents, and attempt to gather military equipment, as current supplies are reportedly worsening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The Kremlin has no interest in withdrawing troops to the status quo ante <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Therefore, any Ukrainian step towards the Kremlin at this time would primarily serve the Kremlin's interests by providing a respite and strengthening its positions in currently controlled territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Russia is preparing for the integration of these "new territories" into its composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### Comparison with Ukraine's Readiness
Ukraine also requires time to receive promised weapons, such as multiple launch rocket systems, and train personnel to use them effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. A strategic counteroffensive by Ukraine is unlikely to occur before late summer or early autumn, as the country would physically not have enough time to prepare earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

### Broader Context
Russia's approach to integrating new territories includes prioritizing the establishment of Russian mobile operators and large TV panels, indicating a focus on "spiritual food" (brainwashing) over immediate material goods and housing restoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This suggests a strategic allocation of resources that prioritizes ideological control over direct civilian welfare.

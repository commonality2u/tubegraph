From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Western governments and influential figures have increasingly voiced [[western_consultations_on_peace_in_Ukraine | calls for peace]] in the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. These proposals suggest a shift towards diplomatic solutions, aiming to manage the conflict's broader geopolitical risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

## Key Proposals for Peace

Several prominent figures have articulated similar peace proposals:

*   **U.S. Secretary of State** The U.S. Secretary of State suggested that the warring parties should return to the situation as it was on the morning of February 24, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This implies Russia's abandonment of newly acquired territories, but not a relinquishment of Crimea or the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Boris Johnson** The British Prime Minister echoed similar sentiments, speaking "almost in unison" with the U.S. position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Henry Kissinger** An article by 99-year-old Henry Kissinger was published in a respected conservative British publication, proposing a solution to the Russian-Ukrainian confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. His plan suggested returning to the "status quo ante" – the situation before the military actions – and then initiating discussions on the status of Crimea and potentially Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Goals of Western Peace Proposals

The primary objective behind these [[proposed_peace_deal_and_russian_capitulation | peace deal proposals]] is to ensure Russia remains within the European framework, rather than inflicting a crushing military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The aim is to avoid triggering a feeling of revanchism within the Russian leadership and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Those proposing these plans are reportedly guided by historical experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## Reasons for Western Proposals

The push for peace from [[western_influence_and_geopolitics_involving_Russia | Western circles]] stems from several factors, representing [[perspectives_on_western_response_and_sanctions | a shared outlook]]:

*   **Uncertainty of Military Outcome**: There is "fog of war" and no guaranteed victory for either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Risk of Nuclear Escalation**: The risk of nuclear escalation is unfortunately "not zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Demographic Pressure and Economic Losses**: Russia's energy war is increasing human and demographic pressure on Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Europeans are reportedly unwilling to suffer prolonged economic and financial losses due to the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Fear of Russian Destabilization**: There is a significant concern that a crushing military defeat of the Russian Federation could lead to severe political consequences with unpredictable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. The destabilization of Russia is seen as no less dangerous to Europe than a crushing Russian victory over Ukraine, and potentially impactful on the global order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

Western establishment forces are seeking to avoid extreme outcomes, believing that the risks of continued confrontation are much higher than the potential benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

## Perceived Effectiveness

It is suggested that Russia's strategy of destroying Ukraine's energy infrastructure to provoke immigration and discontent in Europe is, "in part," already working to pressure Western governments to encourage Ukraine to agree to a [[peace_negotiations_and_kremlins_perspective | peace agreement with Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

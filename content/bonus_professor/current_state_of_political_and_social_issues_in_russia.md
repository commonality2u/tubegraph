From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The current [[internal_political_situation_in_russia | political situation in Russia]] is likened to the dystopian novel *1984*, with the speaker noting a "full implementation" of its themes, including the phrase "war is peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:14">[01:14:14]</a>.

## Examples of "Orwellism" or "Idiocy"

Several instances are cited to illustrate the current climate:
*   A "fake speech" by President Putin to a female flight crew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
*   Patriarch Kirill's statement during Lent that the people of Donbass rebelled against imposed values, specifically "gay parades" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
*   Communist leader Zyuganov's claim of 15 biological laboratories in Ukraine developing viruses and bacteria "against the Russian world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

## Military Operations and Kremlin Demands

President Putin intends to continue military operations in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Russia's position, as stated in a conversation with the Turkish president, is that it "will not stop until Ukraine lays down its arms and accepts the Kremlin's conditions," which amounts to "unconditional surrender" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

## Martial Law and Public Trust

Despite Putin's statement that martial law is not currently planned in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>, this assurance is met with skepticism. The speaker points to Putin's past broken promises, such as not raising the retirement age or changing the constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. An important caveat was added by Putin: martial law is not planned "if suddenly they do not attack us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. The interpretation of what constitutes an "attack" (e.g., shelling by Ukrainian saboteurs) would be solely up to the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Propaganda

President Putin has interpreted public support for the military operation as a "carte blanche" for the "toughest actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. According to a government sociological agency, 71% of Russians support the military operation, 21% are against, and 8% are undecided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

However, this data is questioned:
*   The reliability of government sociological agencies on "sensitive" political issues is doubted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
*   The 21% against represents "every fifth citizen," with an additional 8% undecided likely holding dissenting opinions but are "intimidated" and give "socially approved answers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

### The "Spiral of Silence"

Sociology, in this context, serves to form a "spiral of silence," where the perceived minority position (or doubts) is suppressed because individuals believe they are in the minority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. This propaganda aims to:
*   Cause a feeling of righteousness in supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.
*   Instill a feeling of "predetermination" in opponents ("everything has already been decided") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
*   Generate "hopelessness and deep depression" in those resisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

### Propaganda Techniques

Techniques used to form this "spiral of silence" and create the desired "picture of the world" include:
1.  **Magic of Numbers:** Using statistics (e.g., 71% support) to make statements more believable, as people tend not to argue with figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.
2.  **Expert Commentary:** Featuring a "friendly chorus of approval" from "quasi experts" on state-controlled media, paid to express opinions that reinforce the official narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
3.  **Voices from the Ground:** Orchestrated public speeches and letters of support from regional officials, municipal authorities, and even children (e.g., hospice children forming the letter 'Z') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.
4.  **Repetition:** Constant reiteration of specific phrases, such as "where have you been eight years?" to influence thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.
5.  **Playing on Strong Emotions:** Awakening compassion or anger through visuals and narratives, especially involving children, to manipulate public sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>.

## Fragile Consensus and Economic Impact

Despite claimed widespread support, the speaker questions why the authorities are closing "all alternative sources of information" and "shutting the mouths of all opinion leaders" if they are so confident in their consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>. The answer is that the supposed "general national consensus" is "very fragile" and "unstable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a>.

The speaker predicts that this consensus will crumble as "poverty and food shortages" will prove "stronger than billions of words propaganda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>.

### The Middle Class as a Catalyst for Change

Historically, political upheavals or revolutions in the modern world do not originate from the "humiliated and insulted" but rather from the "middle class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>. In Russia, the middle class, which had been relatively well-off, has seen "all its expectations, dreams, all its life plans, all its strategies collapsed" "within a week" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>. Many are now fleeing Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>. While they haven't fully felt the "bitter consciousness" yet, it is "definitely coming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:21:00">[18:21:00]</a>.

## Anti-Putin Consensus Among the Elite

An "anti-Putin consensus" is rapidly forming, particularly among "yesterday's beneficiaries of the regime," the establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>. These individuals, who accumulated wealth by serving the "motherland," are now unable to spend their money, travel abroad, or engage with the global community as they intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>. Their goal was to "become part of the world," and that aspiration has been denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>. While not yet ready to join the opposition or invest in political positions, they are "tense" and forming a "silent" anti-Putin consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:00">[20:00:00]</a>. This top-down discontent will inevitably meet with the despair and anger of the destroyed middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>.

## Predictions for Political Change

Bloomberg, a reputable business information agency, today stated that President Putin "may lose his power" within the next 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>. This is considered an "unprecedented formulation for the Western media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>. Bloomberg was also the first Western media outlet to report on the threat of a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine in October or November of the previous year, citing American intelligence sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:30:00">[21:30:00]</a>. The speaker reiterates a personal long-standing prediction that President Putin will "disappear from Russian and international politics" in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13:00">[22:13:00]</a>.

## Outlook and Call to Action

The current situation is dire, but the speaker maintains an optimistic view that it "will be worse" before it gets better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:01:00">[23:01:00]</a>. There is hope and a chance for change, which must not be squandered, as it may be "the last chance for all of us and apparently for Russia too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>.

The speaker urges support for those who are struggling, who "support the spark of hope," "defend common sense and human dignity," and "remind us all of moral responsibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>. Special mention is made of Alexei Navalny, who "single-handedly resists the machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:53:00">[24:53:00]</a>.

The speaker pledges to continue reporting on events, supporting "physical dignity," "common sense," and taking a "moral position" as long as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:00">[25:35:00]</a>.

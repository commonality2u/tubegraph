This article discusses the dynamics of [[state_propaganda_and_media_influence_in_russia | propaganda]] and the concept of delegitimization of power within Russia, drawing on various observations and claims made in the transcript.

## The Nature and Impact of Propaganda
Propaganda is described as a force that shapes public perception and trust. The speaker mentions their book "Absolute Weapon" which focuses on the methods, technologies, and techniques used by propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. According to the speaker, propaganda in Russia has significantly shaped the population.

### Impact on Society
People in Russia, "in the overwhelming majority," are described as being "especially designed" to learn "only and exclusively through their own cruel mistakes, deprivation of losses and" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Even this path of personal experience through "deprivation of losses of mistakes" does not always teach them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Attempting to convince those who are misled with facts and arguments is deemed "incorrect" and "counterproductive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Role of Media and Officials
The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is characterized as primarily serving a "propaganda" function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This highlights the [[media_manipulation_and_political_narratives_in_russia | state's use of its official channels]] for disseminating specific narratives.

## Delegitimization of Power
Delegitimization of power is defined as a process where authorities "stop trusting, stop believing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. This loss of trust is considered the "first step to dismantling this power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

### Mechanisms of Delegitimization
A key factor in the delegitimization process is the public perception and use of doubles. The speaker asserts that the elite "knows perfectly well" that Putin "widely uses doubles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a> and that the president "does not appear in public anymore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. The next stage is the delegitimization of power "in the eyes actively happiness of Russian society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

### Alleged Falsifications and Misinformation
Several instances are cited as examples of alleged falsifications or misleading information, contributing to the broader theme of [[impact_of_political_propaganda_in_russia | propaganda]] and a lack of transparency:

*   **Putin-Prigozhin Meeting:** Contrary to the statement by President Putin's press secretary Peskov, a meeting between Putin and Prigozhin and Wagner private military company commanders did not occur on June 29, nor was it planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The Kremlin reportedly intends to present "fake documents" in the form of photos and videos, depicting a "staging" with a Putin double and Wagner commanders from behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Prosecutor General Krasnov's Speech:** Prosecutor General Krasnov's speech at a Security Council meeting before the special military operation was cut from the aired version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This was not because he appeared as a "dove," but because he was an "unacceptable" "hawk" even by Kremlin standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Two video versions of the meeting were prepared: one with Krasnov's speech and one without <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The very "tough," even "cruel," speech was cut from the version that went on air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Fake Peace Treaty:** During a meeting with African presidents, Putin allegedly showed a "fake document" that he claimed was a signed peace treaty with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. This document, purportedly from negotiations held in March, was dated April, indicating it was a "falsification" or "hoax" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

### Public Participation and Control
The speaker emphasizes that the only guarantee for adequate people to come to power who will serve the country's interests is "direct participation in the political crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This public involvement is crucial for creating "public guarantees" that the new government's course will be implemented in the "interests of our society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Historically, no other guarantees exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Initially, only "public participation" and "public control" are effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

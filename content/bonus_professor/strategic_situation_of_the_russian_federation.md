The [[political_situation_in_russia | Russian Federation]] currently finds itself in a "strategic trap," a situation largely created by President Vladimir Putin himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This concept, often used in military art, also applies to business and other fields where strategy is involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Characteristics of a Strategic Trap

A strategic trap is defined by two main features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>:
1.  **Fundamental Inability to Achieve Goals** The inability of one party to a conflict to achieve its military-political goals by military means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
2.  **Continued Escalation Despite Inability** Despite this fundamental inability, the party continues to increase efforts to achieve these goals, even though they may be obviously unattainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Historical Examples

History provides several examples of superpowers falling into such traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>:
*   The United States in Vietnam (1965-1973) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   The United States in Afghanistan (2001-2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   The Soviet Union in Afghanistan (1979-1989) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   Modern [[russian_military_situation_and_challenges_in_ukraine | Russia]] in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

These situations, particularly those involving superpowers, tend to be prolonged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. All mentioned cases ended with withdrawal and political defeat, though not necessarily military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. In each instance, colossal resources were ineptly wasted to no avail, leading to belated political decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Reasons for Falling into Strategic Traps

Countries or entities fall into strategic traps due to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>:
1.  **Overestimation of Own Power** A party overestimates its own economic and military power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
2.  **Underestimation of Enemy Strength** A party underestimates the enemy's military power and the ability of civilians to serve as a constant source of resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
3.  **Misunderstanding the Theater of Operations** A lack of understanding of the significance and specifics of the military theater, such as the jungle in Vietnam or mountainous terrain in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
4.  **Error in Assessing Strategic Context** Underestimation or error in judging the strategic context, such as external support for the adversary (e.g., Soviet and Chinese aid to North Vietnam, Western aid to Afghanistan against the Soviets, and current Western aid to Ukraine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Reasons for Persisting in Strategic Traps

Even with predictions of danger, countries persist in these situations for various reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>:
1.  **Arrogance of Power** The hope that a difference in economic and military potential will eventually favor the side with greater potential. This "arrogance of power" characterizes not only the U.S. in Vietnam or Afghanistan but also the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and the [[russias_economic_challenges_and_strategy | Russian Federation]] in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
2.  **Cognitive Delusion** A tendency to continually raise stakes, similar to a casino player, in an attempt to recoup losses. This is seen in military leadership, such as McNamara in Vietnam or the current [[russian_military_situation_and_challenges_in_ukraine | Russian military]] actions in Ukraine, like the energy war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Businesses also exhibit this by increasing investments in losing projects rather than cutting losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
3.  **Distorting Properties of Religion or Ideology** While less typical for the US or Soviet Union, ideology played a role. Religious factors, as seen in the Iran-Iraq War, can lead to prolonged conflicts with immense losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

All people are susceptible to cognitive delusions, but authoritarian leaders are particularly prone to persisting in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Unlike democratic systems where leaders face criticism and competition, forcing quicker reactions to resource depletion, authoritarian leaders can more easily persist in such delusions. They do so because losing or exiting on what they perceive as dishonorable terms is fraught with the loss of political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

## Russia's Current Strategic Situation

The [[economic_and_political_situation_in_russia | Russian Federation]] is currently in a strategic trap in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Unlike the Soviet Union, [[state_of_the_russian_economy | Russia is not a superpower]] with comparable resource potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   [[state_of_the_russian_economy | Russia's GDP share]] in the world is 1.7%, compared to 23% for the United States and 17% for the European Union, not counting Japan and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. This indicates a colossal incomparability of economic and military potentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   Given this disparity, victory for [[russias_economic_challenges_and_strategy | Russia]] is not possible; the discussion should be about the conditions for an honorable withdrawal from Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
*   The [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | Russian government]] missed an ideal chance for an honorable withdrawal in March of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. At that time, the Ukrainian leadership was ready to make concessions, but this is no longer the case for either the leadership or Ukrainian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

### Impact on [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | Russian Leadership]]

The situation for the [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | Russian leadership]] is critical and is expected to worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. To achieve an honorable exit that can be presented as a victory, President Putin is willing to do anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.
*   He has two perceived resources: tactical nuclear weapons and manpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
*   Believing that [[russian_military_situation_and_challenges_in_ukraine | Russia's human potential]] significantly exceeds Ukraine's, he is prepared to use this resource, throwing people into the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   To preserve his power, he considers losses of up to half a million people acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
*   This willingness to sacrifice people highlights the authoritarian nature of the leadership, where fear of losing power drives decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

There is no conspiracy luring leaders into this situation; they enter it of their own free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Once deeply stuck, opponents will wage a war of attrition, similar to how the U.S. aided Afghan dushmans against the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. The West is now intensively aiding Ukraine, seeing an opportunity to deliver a decisive blow to the military power of the [[russian_military_situation_and_challenges_in_ukraine | Russian Federation]] and discourage its future use of military force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. This opportunity was personally provided by President Vladimir Putin to the United States and NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

Despite warnings from Russian experts before the invasion of Afghanistan by NATO, the "third person effect" cognitive fallacy was at play, where the U.S. believed it would succeed where the Soviets failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

## Conclusion

The goals of the "special operation" are now internal to [[russian_internal_politics_and_economy | Russia]], with the main goal for Putin being the preservation of his own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. However, this strategy paradoxically weakens his power daily, as those around him and in [[russian_internal_politics_and_economy | Russian society]] realize something is wrong and they are caught in a trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

As Miyamoto Musashi's treatise, *The Book of Five Rings*, states, "immature strategy [is] the reason for sadness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. This phrase accurately describes what has happened to [[future_governance_and_geopolitical_strategies_of_russia | Russia]], the Kremlin, and President Putin, with sadness intensifying for the country and its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.

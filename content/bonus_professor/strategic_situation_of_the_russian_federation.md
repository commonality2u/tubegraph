This article reflects on the strategic situation of the Russian Federation, particularly regarding its involvement in Ukraine. The speaker, Valery Solovey, recorded this 47th episode of "What's Happening" on Sunday, January 8th, for broadcast on Monday, January 9th, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The episode offers a reflection on the strategic context rather than a review of weekly events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Defining a Strategic Trap

The term "strategic trap" is not exclusive to military art; it applies broadly to areas where strategy is used, such as business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. A strategic trap is characterized by two main features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>:
1.  **Fundamental Inability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>: One party in a conflict is fundamentally unable to achieve its military-political goals through military means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
2.  **Continued Escalation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>: Despite this fundamental inability, the party continues to increase efforts to achieve these goals, which are often obviously unattainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Historical Examples of Strategic Traps
Superpowers have historically found themselves in strategic traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>:
*   **United States**: In Vietnam (1965-1973) and Afghanistan (2001-2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Soviet Union**: In Afghanistan (1979-1989) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Modern Russia**: Currently in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

These historical situations were lengthy and concluded with withdrawal and political defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Political defeat does not necessarily equate to military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. For instance, after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, the Soviet-backed leadership remained in power for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. In all these cases, colossal resources were ineptly wasted to no avail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, leading to belated political decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## Reasons for Falling into Strategic Traps
Countries, and even corporations, can fall into strategic traps due to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>:
1.  **Overestimation of Own Power**: Overestimating economic and military strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
2.  **Underestimation of Enemy Strength**: Underestimating not only military power but also the ability of civilians to act as a permanent reservoir of resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
3.  **Misunderstanding of Theater of Operations**: Not understanding the significance or specifics of the theater of military operations, such as the jungle in Vietnam or mountainous terrain in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
4.  **Error in Assessing Strategic Context**: Underestimating or misjudging the broader strategic context, such as the confrontation between superpowers providing aid to one side (e.g., Soviet Union and China aiding North Vietnam, the West aiding Afghanistan against Soviets, and the West aiding Ukraine against Russia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. [[Russian sociopolitical dynamics | Russian propaganda]] reasonably notes that the West is against Russia, primarily as a supplier of equipment, intelligence, and even Western PMCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Why Countries Persist in Strategic Traps

Despite predictions and warnings, countries often get stuck in and do not want to exit these situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>:
1.  **Arrogance of Power**: The hope that the difference in economic and military potential will eventually favor the side with greater potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This "arrogance of power" has been characteristic of the United States in Vietnam and Afghanistan, and the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, and is now applicable to the actions of the Russian Federation in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
2.  **Cognitive Delusion**: The military-political leadership suffers from cognitive delusion, akin to a casino player who continuously increases stakes to recoup losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Robert McNamara's proposals to increase American military presence in Vietnam exemplify this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. The "energy war" Russia is waging in Ukraine is seen as a desire to raise stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This delusion prevents fixation of losses, which is typical for businesses that continue to invest in mediocre losing projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
3.  **Distorting Properties of Religion/Ideology**: While not typical for the US or Soviet Union, the distorting effects of ideology or religion can play a role, as seen in the Iran-Iraq war which lasted 8 years and resulted in over 1.5 million casualties, fueled by the "passionate, heated ideology of the victorious Islamic revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

All people are subject to cognitive delusions regardless of their political or ideological views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. However, only countries possessing colossal economic and military potential (superpowers) can easily persist in such delusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Economically developed but smaller countries are forced to abandon conflicts more quickly and seek reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Democratic systems tend to react faster to resource depletion due to criticism and competition, leading to shorter average conflict durations (3-4 to 16-18 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Authoritarian leaders, however, persist because losing or exiting on perceived "not honorable" terms is fraught with the loss of their political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that there is no conspiracy theory behind strategic traps; political leaders willingly enter these situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Once deeply entrenched and unwilling to exit, opponents begin to wage a war of attrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. The West's intensified assistance to Ukraine presents an opportunity to deliver a decisive blow to the military power of the Russian Federation and deter future military force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. This opportunity was provided personally by President Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

An example of cognitive fallacy, the "third person effect," is cited: when the US invaded Afghanistan, Russian experts unanimously warned against it based on Soviet experience, but the Americans believed they would succeed where the Soviets failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

## Russia's Current Strategic Situation

The current situation for the Russian Federation is extremely difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. While past strategic traps were long, the speaker believes Russia's situation will not be as prolonged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Unlike the Soviet Union, Russia is not a superpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Russia's GDP share in the world is 1.7%, compared to 23% for the United States and 17% for the European Union, demonstrating a colossal incomparability of economic and military potentials with countries supporting Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.

Given this, the idea of victory is unrealistic; the focus shifts to honorable withdrawal conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. The Russian government missed an "ideal chance" for an honorable withdrawal in March 2022, when the Ukrainian leadership was ready to make concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Now, neither the Ukrainian leadership nor society will make concessions <a class="yt:timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

The situation for the Russian Federation, and especially for its leadership, will worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. To achieve an honorable exit that can be presented as a victory, Putin is ready to do anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. His resources include nuclear tactical weapons and manpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. Believing that Russia's human potential significantly exceeds Ukraine's, he is prepared to "throw the people into the furnace of confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Putin considers losses of up to half a million people acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

The Russian Ministry of Defense does not confirm or refute these estimates and primarily reports on Ukrainian losses, which if aggregated, suggest Ukraine would have no soldiers or air force left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. This type of statistics has always been characteristic of [[political situation in Russia | Russia]], even under the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.

### Putin's Central Goal
The primary goal of the "special operation" is no longer external, but internal: to preserve Putin's own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Paradoxically, his daily actions weaken his own power, as those around him and [[russian_political_landscape_and_potential_changes | Russian society]] understand that the country is caught in this trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

## Conclusion
A quote from Miyamoto Musashi's "The Book of Five Rings" is used to describe the situation: "Immature strategy is the reason for sadness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. The speaker asserts that this "immature strategy" is characteristic of the Russian government and will lead to intensified sadness for the country, its people, and all of [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

The speaker concludes by stating that the coming year will be much more difficult, but offers hope that it will provide a chance to decisively influence Russia's destiny, assuring listeners that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

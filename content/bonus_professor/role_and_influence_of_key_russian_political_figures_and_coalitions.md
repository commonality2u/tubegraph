This article outlines the anticipated shifts in the configuration of power within the Russian Federation, focusing on the roles and influences of various political figures and elite coalitions. The described changes are planned for the fall, aiming to ensure stability post-transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Current Political Landscape

In non-democratic systems like the Russian Federation, stability is maintained by differentiating influence among opposing groups and elite detachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. While formal legislative and judicial powers are seen as "pathetic appendages" of the executive power, particularly presidential power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, true influence comes from controlling spheres of influence and ensuring mutual deterrence among powerful groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This mutual threat of destruction or paralysis ensures the system's stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

The **late Putin** served as a "moderator and coordinator" for the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. With his departure, the system requires new methods for dividing spheres of influence and establishing a negotiating platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The current political situation is described as dubious and extremely unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Proposed New Configuration of Power

A new configuration of power is being prepared for the fall, centered on ensuring the safety of transitions and post-event stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This involves:

### Key Political Figures

*   **Valery Solovey**: Host of the program, providing analysis of current events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Yevgeny Prigozhin**: Mentioned in the context of his "return" to Russia, symbolized by a full-length bronze monument erected at his so-called grave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. The speaker implies a literal return is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
*   **"Putin's double" (Yevgeny Vasilyevich)**: Currently "usurping" presidential power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. His resignation is a precondition for early presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The Russian elite is eager to remove this "doll" from leadership due to perceived risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The West's increased willingness to allow strikes on Russian territory is linked to their understanding that the "real Putin is gone" and the current ruling group is more realistic and less inclined to escalate to thermonuclear war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Denis Manturov**: A candidate for Prime Minister in the near future (autumn) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. He is a protégé of Viktor Chemezov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Dmitry Patrushev**: A candidate to become President in early elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. He is part of the Patrushev coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Nikolai Platonovich Patrushev**: Described as "mighty" and standing behind Dmitry Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. He has promised to leave any government position if his son is elected president, remaining in an informal or insignificant capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. In an alternative scenario where Dmitry Patrushev does not become president, Nikolai Patrushev would head the State Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Alexei Dyumin**: Appointed as Secretary of the State Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. His role is significant if the State Council becomes a new Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. He has good relations with both Chemezov and Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

### Key Coalitions

*   **Chemezov’s Coalition**: Led by Viktor Chemezov, this coalition is considered no less influential than Patrushev's, and possibly more so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Patrushev’s Coalition**: Led by Nikolai Patrushev, this coalition is influential and positioned as an opposing force to Chemezov’s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Proposed Power Structure and Dynamics

The proposed new configuration aims to establish a system of checks and balances among elite groups, ensuring mutual deterrence and avoiding a single group seizing full power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

*   **Prime Minister**: Expected to be Denis Manturov, a protégé of Viktor Chemezov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This represents one group placing its minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **President**: Expected to be Dmitry Patrushev, going from a different starting position, not as Vice-Premier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. His candidacy is supported by the Patrushev coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **State Council**: This body is envisioned as a new "Politburo" and the key negotiating platform where the key Russian elite will be united <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   **Scenario 1**: If Dmitry Patrushev becomes president, Viktor Chemezov will head the State Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This arrangement creates a balance where the President (Dmitry Patrushev, backed by Nikolai Patrushev) and the Head of the State Council (Chemezov) simultaneously restrain each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    *   **Scenario 2**: If Dmitry Patrushev does not run or another person runs for president, Nikolai Patrushev will head the State Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

This [[russian_political_leadership_transitions_and_internal_power_dynamics | transition]] is described as actively being prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. The speaker notes that the "Transit" may unfold in unforeseen and potentially destructive ways for the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

## External Factors and Elite Decisions

The increased possibility of strikes on Russian territory using Western weapons is attributed to the West's understanding that the "real Putin is gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. They perceived the original Putin as "crazy" and "dangerously crazy" (in a clinical sense) and feared his willingness to "drown the whole world in blood and fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. The current ruling group is seen as more realistic, not wanting thermonuclear war, and having internal limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This perception has led to a decrease in the risks of escalation from the Western perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

The internal political dynamics within the Russian Federation, particularly the potential for an unforeseen and destructive [[russian_political_leadership_transitions_and_internal_power_dynamics | transition]], could also influence Ukraine's readiness to engage in peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. This suggests that [[influence_of_external_factors_and_elite_decisions_on_russian_governance | external factors and elite decisions]] significantly impact Russian governance and foreign policy.

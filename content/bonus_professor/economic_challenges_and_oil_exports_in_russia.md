The economic stability and military operations of Russia are heavily reliant on its energy exports. The main source of foreign exchange for the country is its oil and gas exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. However, recent developments indicate significant [[economic_challenges_in_russia | economic challenges]] on the horizon.

## Declining Oil Revenues

According to Bloomberg, Russian Urals oil, which constitutes two-thirds of the country's oil exports, dropped below $40 per barrel at the end of the second week of January, reaching an exact price of $38.7 per barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This represents a record low since the summer of 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

This decrease in oil prices is expected to lead to declining export revenues, posing serious problems for the state budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Further exacerbating the situation, a price ceiling is being introduced from February 5th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Russia stands to lose an estimated $100 billion to $180 billion in foreign exchange earnings, or even more, if these figures are exaggerated, the losses will still be substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Budgetary Adjustments and Public Burden

To compensate for these budgetary losses, the burden is expected to fall on the general population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. While the armed forces and security agencies (Russian Guard, police, FSB, Federal Protective Service) will continue to receive maximum financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, social expenses and funding for [[economic_challenges_and_reforms_in_russia | economic development]] will be significantly cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This policy echoes the 20th-century sentiment of "guns instead of oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>, with citizens potentially facing reductions even in basic goods like palm oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>.

## Attempted Export Increase

In an effort to offset the losses, Russia is attempting to increase oil exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. In January, oil exports sharply increased by one and a half times compared to December, following a December decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

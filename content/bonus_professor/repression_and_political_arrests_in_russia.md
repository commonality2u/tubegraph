In Russia, the term "arrests are in fashion now" has become applicable to the current situation, reflecting a wave of [[cultural_and_societal_repression_within_russia | repressions]] and [[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | sociopolitical changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. This environment has seen a significant increase in legal and punitive actions against various segments of society.

## Political Persecution and Judicial Actions

A wave of [[repressive_laws_and_implications_for_russian_society | repressions]] has begun against individuals seeking to participate in municipal deputy elections in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Strong candidates and current deputies are being persecuted, facing charges and obstacles to prevent their registration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

Notable cases include:
*   **Aleksey Guryanov** was sentenced to seven years in prison for using a single word, "cafe visa," which is prohibited in the Russian Federation as a term for the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. This marks the first sentence in Russia related to discrediting the Russian army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.
*   **Andrey Pivovarov**, former director of Open Russia, has been imprisoned for over a year since May 31 of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. The prosecutor is seeking a five-year term against him for carrying out activities of an "undesirable organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

## "Negative Mobilization" and Public Control

The ongoing climate is described as a "negative mobilization" within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. While some citizens are called into the armed forces, others face punitive measures designed to prevent them from expressing their opinions or dissenting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

### Cases in Sports

The highly publicized cases involving hockey players are presented as a form of "information, moral, and psychological preparation" for a broader mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>:
*   Hockey player Fedotov was reportedly sent to serve in the north <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.
*   Three additional hockey players were accused of illegally acquiring military tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

These actions are seen as an "exemplary flogging" to demonstrate that everyone, regardless of their name or fame, is subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. The government, however, is not fully confident that society will react positively to such measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

As of March 4, 2022, an "information iron curtain" is descending upon Russia, severely restricting media freedom and public discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Collapse of Alternative Media
Alternative media outlets in Russia have largely ceased to exist, with bloggers being one of the few exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It is easier to list the few remaining independent outlets than those that have been forced to close due to the inability to speak freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Examples of affected media include:
*   The famous Ural building sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   Silver Rain, which, though not formally closed, has stopped producing news and discussing politically or socially significant situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

The current media landscape is painfully reminiscent of the Soviet Union, which famously had only two television channels and one main newspaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Threat to YouTube and its Implications
[[planned_blocking_of_youtube_in_russia_and_its_implications | YouTube is also under threat of closure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. While many users access YouTube for entertainment, useful content, and non-political purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, it also serves as a source of income for a considerable number of people in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. YouTube has already announced that it will not monetize or show ads in the Russian Federation, sharply reducing monetization for content creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

One reason for the delay in blocking YouTube might be the authorities' fear of politicizing its largely non-political audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## [[repressive_laws_and_political_commentary_in_russia | Repressive Laws and Political Commentary in Russia]]
A new law regarding military "centuries" was adopted by the State Duma on Friday, March 4, and is expected to be signed by the president soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This law makes it unclear how to discuss events in Ukraine, as any phrase or information could potentially be regarded as false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. New amendments to the administrative code are also being prepared, which may prohibit even the term "anti-war movement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

The term "military special operation" is used by Russian propaganda to describe the events in Ukraine, while "military campaign" is suggested as a more accurate and legally compliant term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## [[cultural_and_political_repression_in_russia | Cultural and Political Repression in Russia]] and Martial Law Elements
The current situation already includes elements of martial law, such as censorship, which has been introduced without legal justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This "de facto" martial law is partially introduced in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. If formal martial law is declared in certain regions, military authorities would gain the right to seize private property and equipment for their own needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. This could lead to massive violations of private property rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

## [[state_propaganda_and_media_influence_in_russia | State Propaganda and Media Influence in Russia]]
Pro-government sociological agencies like FLOP and VTsIOM claim that 70% of the population supports the Kremlin's operation in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. However, there is skepticism about these figures, suggesting the situation is "far from being so rosy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The Kremlin interprets this reported support as a carte blanche for its actions, even the most extreme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

The concept of the "spiral of silence" is mentioned as a key tool in information and psychological warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. The speaker urges people not to believe the propaganda trick that those who want peace are a small minority, stating that "life is better than any explanations" and will eventually change even the most stubborn individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

## Call to Action
The speaker urges individuals to strengthen horizontal connections, establish ties with neighbors, and help those who strive to convey a clear voice of common sense, human dignity, and moral sobriety to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. This is based on the belief that "you can't get out of hell alone," and that it is only possible to overcome the current situation together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

An emergency broadcast on Friday, February 16, somewhere after 7:00 p.m., was prompted by the news of [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalny_and_its_political_implications | Alexei Navalny's death]] or apparent killing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The speaker extended condolences to [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalny_and_its_political_implications | Alexei Anatolyevich's]] relatives, family, and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, despite the need to mention that he is included in the list of terrorists and extremists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Condolences were also offered to all who worked with him, collaborated, sympathized with, supported, and followed him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalny_and_its_political_implications | Alexei Navalny]] possessed an "amazing quality": commitment to the goals and objectives he set, which was a significant achievement and a distinctive quality for him as a politician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Political Murder or Natural Death?

The speaker is inclined to believe [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalny_and_its_political_implications | Alexei Navalny's]] death was an "unnatural death," specifically a "political murder" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. An international etiological investigation would be necessary to convince the speaker that his death was natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Even if it were a natural death, the Kremlin has spent the past few years creating "impossible conditions" to "freeze Alexei," including nearly a year in a punishment cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. These conditions were precisely intended to have a critical impact on his health and psyche, though [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalny_and_its_political_implications | Alexei]] coped with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Indirect Evidence of Political Murder

Several indirect, yet obvious, signs point to a political murder:
*   A very quick, unanimous reaction from the Russian official media, reporting the news immediately "on command" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   An unusually quick reaction from Peskov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   Over the past month, there have been at least two or three [[assassination_attempts_on_trump_and_putin | assassination attempts]] on "very dangerous and important opponents" of the elite group claiming full power in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Anticipated Narratives and Distractions

The speaker anticipates a flood of cynical lies, "real nonsense," and "phantasmagoria" regarding the circumstances of [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalny_and_its_political_implications | Alexei Navalny's death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Expected narratives include:
*   [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalny_and_its_political_implications | Alexei Navalny]] is actually alive, well, and abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   The West sacrificed him to compromise the "so-called presidential elections" or to "blur the effect" of [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death_and_replacement | President Putin's]] interview with American journalist Carlson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

This tactic is known in PR jargon as "blurring"â€”throwing in "notorious phantasmagoria" to distract public attention from the core issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

## The "Unprofitability" Argument Debunked

A common argument that will be heard is that [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalny_and_its_political_implications | Navalny's death]] was "categorically unprofitable" for the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This argument is dismissed, drawing parallels to previous events deemed "unprofitable" for the Kremlin, such as the murder of Nemtsov, [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalny_and_its_political_implications | the poisoning of Navalny]], and the start of the Russian military operation against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. From the speaker's perspective, these events were, in fact, "profitable, logical, and consistent" for those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## The Logic of the Alleged Murder

The alleged murder of [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalny_and_its_political_implications | Navalny]] is explained not as revenge for a previously failed poisoning operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, but as an effort to eliminate any risks or threats ahead of the "so-called presidential elections" and, more importantly, the "transfer of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This power transfer is expected to go from the person who will be elected president (a "double") to the elite group currently claiming all power in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. They seek to remove the "slightest risks," "squeeze out all the grass," and "cement all the fields where this grass may appear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

The speaker reiterates that at least two or three opponents of the regime have faced [[assassination_attempts_on_trump_and_putin | assassination attempts]] in the last month, fortunately unsuccessful for the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The death of [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalny_and_its_political_implications | Navalny]] is deemed "very profitable now because everything can be blamed on the quiet path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>, with the blame placed on the "body that has been in the Valdai refrigerator since October 26" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, implying [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death | Putin's alleged death]].

## Call for International Investigation

To refute any "slander" against the Kremlin, the authorities could easily invite international experts, specifically Western and German experts (as it was in Germany that [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalny_and_its_political_implications | Navalny's]] poisoning was diagnosed), to conduct an international public examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The body should also be given to the family of the deceased, his relatives, and friends for disposal, rather than being disposed of by the Federal Penitentiary Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. If the government fails to do this, it validates the "natural suspicions" articulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Warning to Oppositionists

The speaker warns that [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalny_and_its_political_implications | Navalny's death]] is likely "only the beginning," and Russian oppositionists, both those who remained in Russia and the most prominent ones who are outside the Russian Federation, are now under threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This is a "serious warning" and a lesson for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. The year 2024 is predicted to be not just dramatic, but potentially tragic and much harder than the year the pandemic or the "special military operation" began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. It could be the "hardest year" in their entire lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Despite the tragic words and difficult future predicted, the speaker conveys confidence and hope that "everything will change for the better" starting in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The speaker states with certainty that "victory will be ours" for the sake of [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalny_and_its_political_implications | Alexei]] and for all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

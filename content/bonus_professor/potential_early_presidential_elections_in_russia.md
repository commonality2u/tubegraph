Russia is reportedly undergoing the "construction of a new configuration of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This process aims to ensure the safety of transitions and stability in a "post-puncture" era, indicating a period after the current leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The focus is on preparing for this new power structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

In Russia's non-democratic system, power is concentrated in the executive, specifically the presidential power, with legislative and judicial branches acting as "pathetic appendages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Stability in this system, especially with opposing elite groups, relies on differentiating influence and ensuring mutual deterrence through control of various spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This mutual deterrence prevents any single group from seizing full power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

The "late Putin" previously served as the moderator and coordinator of this system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. With his absence, a new mechanism is required to divide spheres of influence and create a negotiating platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Planned Power Configuration (Autumn)

A new configuration of power is being actively prepared for formation in the autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. This plan involves:

*   **New Prime Minister**
    *   It is assumed that a new Prime Minister will be appointed in the near future, specifically in the autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   Denis Manturov's candidacy is being discussed for this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
    *   Manturov is described as a protégé of Viktor Chemezov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
    *   Chemezov's coalition is considered no less, and possibly more, influential than Patrushev's coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Early Presidential Elections**
    *   The preconditions for early presidential elections include the resignation of "Putin's double," identified as Yevgeny Vasilyevich, who is currently "usurping" power in an unstable situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   Despite the appointment of a new prime minister from one coalition, a different person is expected to run for president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   The Patrushev coalition has promised that Dmitry Patrushev will run for president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. He would start from a different position than his current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   The current "President Putin" (the double) will "go nowhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The Russian elite is eager to remove the "double" or "doll" as quickly as possible due to the perceived risk of him heading Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Role of the State Council**
    *   The State Council is intended to become the new "Politburo," serving as a negotiating platform and a place where the key Russian elite will unite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This contrasts with the Security Council, which previously played a similar role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
    *   If Dmitry Patrushev becomes president, Viktor Chemezov is slated to head the State Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This creates a system of checks and balances where Dmitry Patrushev, supported by Nikolai Patrushev (who would step down from government positions), holds presidential power, while Chemezov at the State Council provides a balancing force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
    *   However, if the situation does not unfold as Nikolai Patrushev desires (e.g., Dmitry Patrushev does not run or wins), then Nikolai Patrushev himself would head the State Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Alexei Dyumin's Appointment**
    *   The appointment of Alexei Dyumin as Secretary of the State Council is a symptom of this new power configuration forming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
    *   Dyumin's role and capabilities will depend on the overall significance of the State Council itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. If the State Council becomes the new Politburo, his role will be "very significant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
    *   Dyumin reportedly has good relations with both Chemezov and Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

This [[potential_political_changes_and_future_leadership_in_russia | transit]] period, while planned, may unfold in "unforeseen" and "destructive" ways for the current system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. These developments are described as the "biggest events" in Russia in 25-30 years, set to change the country's trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

## External Influences and Consequences

The possibility of strikes on Russian territory by Western weapons is linked to the West's understanding that "Putin is gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. The West was previously afraid of the "crazy" and "dangerously crazy" nature of the real Putin, who was suffering from a fatal disease and potentially willing to "drown the whole world in blood and fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

The current ruling group is perceived as more realistic and unwilling to engage in thermonuclear war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. As a result, the risks of escalation from Western actions are seen as decreased compared to when Putin was alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. Putin reportedly died on October 26 last year at 20:42 Moscow time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

While increased Western strikes will not lead to a "strategic turning point" or a Ukrainian military victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, they can weaken Russia's offensive capabilities and cause significant damage to its armed forces and logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. Ultimately, the situation is expected to reach another "strategic impasse" around the turn of summer and autumn, similar to the one experienced last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This impasse might incentivize a transition to direct peaceful consultations between Russia and Ukraine, especially if Ukraine's perception of the situation changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Russia has already made an offer for peaceful consultations, which Ukraine rejected a month ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

The internal [[political_dynamics_and_potential_leadership_change_in_russia | political dynamics]] within the Russian Federation, particularly the potential for the [[potential_political_changes_in_russia_after_putin | transition]] to unfold in an unforeseen and destructive manner for the system, could also influence Ukraine's readiness for peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

> [!INFO] Yevgeny Prigozhin's "Return"
> A full-length bronze monument to Yevgeny Prigozhin has appeared in St. Petersburg, on his so-called grave at Porokhovskoy cemetery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. The speaker facetiously suggests Prigozhin will "definitely return" to Russia and visit his own grave to admire the monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. This is presented as an example of the "grotesque" or "macabre humor" characteristic of Russia, where "anything" can happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.

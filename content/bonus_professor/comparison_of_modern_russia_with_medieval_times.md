A significant theme in discussions about modern Russia is the comparison of its current state to the Middle Ages, often characterized by a prevailing sense of irrationality, superstition, and a leadership reliant on esoteric practices rather than conventional governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. This perspective suggests a "new Middle Ages" where established norms of rationality and public accountability are replaced by a pursuit of the mystical and miraculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

## Rise of Occultism and Superstition

The current atmosphere in Russia is described as being engulfed by an "occult from water which does not end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>, with the situation in the country intensifying these trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This is largely attributed to the fear surrounding the country's leader, Vladimir Putin, and his approaching 68th birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

### Pyramids and Ancient Rituals
A notable example of this trend is the construction of Egyptian-style pyramids across Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. One such object near Tomsk was built by United Russia deputies and large businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. This location was chosen due to an archaeological discovery in the late 1980s of a Bronze Age complex containing inventory items related to Egyptian culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

The purpose of these pyramids, from a "Russian black ideas about the pyramids" perspective, is that they are endowed with mystical power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. Historically, pyramids were either tombs or used for mystical rites (as in Mesoamerica) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. Modern-day shamans also use small pyramids for rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

A cautionary tale of a farmer in southern Russia who built a large pyramid, claiming it cured his diseases and increased his cattle and crop yields, ended with him going bankrupt a couple of years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

### Occult Practices in Leadership
The increase in the occult component within the current government is linked to desires to prolong life and be healed, particularly for the leader himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. There is a "stylization" among the elite, where if someone "up there" does something, others imitate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

Vladimir Putin himself is reported to have performed "very strange non-Christian rites" with an elder known as "Nikifor" during Easter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>. These rituals were for his health and protection, and for "induction of damage" and "evil oil" against his enemies, which is not accepted among Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

Furthermore, early in his rule, Putin reportedly consulted three fortune tellers (not prophecies) to discover his future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. All three gave "almost identical" predictions that he would rule for 20 years, but the end would be "terrible" if he could not "change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. These predictions, though extensive, were clear enough to read "real things" like Georgia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>. The predictions also mentioned "southern rulers of poisons" whom he should fear, such as Milošević, Mubarak, and Gaddafi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

The belief in these predictions means they act as "drivers of real Russian politics and foreign policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>. The current increase in reliance on occult properties is directly linked to the cyclical end of this 20-year period and the leader's "fading age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>.

### Relics and Miracles
The pursuit of a "miracle" is a fundamental factor for those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:17:00">[22:17:00]</a>. While Putin is not considered a religious person in the classical sense, his attendance at Russian Orthodox Church events is seen more as protocol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:35:00">[22:35:00]</a>. The elite do not exclude the mystical element but treat it as a "miracle in its separate and independent manifestations" rather than faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>.

For them, Christianity is a "religion of the flesh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>, and one of the main attributes of a miracle in the ROC is "power and human remains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:00">[23:42:00]</a>. The demand for such relics has always been high, despite religious inconsistencies (Old Testament forbids touching the dead) and outright deception (e.g., two heads of John Chrysostom, the mummified body of Alexander of Svir being a circumcised corpse) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>.

An example given is a man detained in Krasnoyarsk carrying a full human skeleton, which was to be used to arrange an altar for Santa Muerte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:26:00">[25:26:00]</a>. The buyer of these remains paid a significant amount, believing them to be from a "Byzantine king, a great warrior, victorious, a sage, and merciful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:09:00">[26:09:00]</a>. The cult of Santa Muerte, a Mexican syncretic course combining Christianity and traditional Mexican beliefs, requires a skeleton or skull of a "powerful person" for its altar, as the results would be "just as stupid" if from a "fool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:21:00">[29:21:00]</a>.

## Socio-Political Landscape and Moods

The prevalence of mystical, quasi-esoteric, and pseudo-occult moods in modern Russia is described as "much worse" than during the end of the Russian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:56:00">[38:56:00]</a>. It is "almost universal" within the establishment, with a sharp demand for esotericism and occultism growing since 2014-2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:40:00">[39:40:00]</a>.

### Elite Behavior and Loss of Luck
The elite, who previously held an "almost mystical belief in Putin's luck," are now experiencing "extreme nervousness and very anxious... panic or semi-panic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>. Since August (referring to the Belarus revolution), the leader has stopped leading, and things are falling apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>. The elite complain about the impossibility of meeting or talking with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:57:00">[17:57:00]</a>. They feel a "loss of luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:00">[18:55:00]</a>.

> "they are sitting there on Rublevka whispering and in horror whispering they do not understand what is happening and do not understand why all this is now a video but they are scared so yes of course it affects they feel this feeling of loss of luck loss of luck is very important for them because they had an almost mystical belief in Putin's luck is almost mystical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>

This situation leads them to seek "new force" or "magical instrument[s]" because they "cannot change reality with the usual for themselves politics economic instruments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:39:00">[42:39:00]</a>.

### The "World Government" Conspiracy
A significant portion of the Russian population, including almost all FSB officers and a "significant part of the financial Stepochkin," believe in a "world government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:09:00">[43:09:00]</a>. They cannot believe in the "chaos of the disorder of the world" and assume there is a "secret chancery" or competing chanceries ruling the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:00">[43:40:00]</a>. This worldview leads them to "try to find this ring of omnipotence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:03:00">[44:03:00]</a>.

Political competition among the elite also manifests in turning to "various magical or pseudo occult resources" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:17:00">[44:17:00]</a>. This is described as a "team building" exercise, where skepticism is seen as a "loss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:02:00">[46:02:00]</a>.

### Parallels to the Middle Ages
The current situation in Russia is explicitly compared to a "new Middle Ages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. This era is characterized by:
*   People poisoning themselves "like in the era of Alexander I" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:09:13]</a>.
*   The government participating in "dense black magic rituals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:17">[01:09:17]</a>.
*   Worshipping the "remains of the dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>.

> "we live in a new Middle Ages, people poison themselves with poisons, like in the era of Alexander I, the government participates in dense black magic rituals, worships the remains of the dead, well, tell me, friends, isn't this the Middle Ages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>

This "new Middle Ages" is seen as a period where the "Russian establishment is thirsty for a miracle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. They want Putin to leave, but for "everything remains as it was" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>, which is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. Putin himself "wants to outwit history" and "perform another miracle," which is also deemed impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

The situation is leading to a feeling of "fear" for the establishment, akin to walking through a cemetery at night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. This is perceived as a "fatal line where all this will collapse and collapse very quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. The accumulated "hatred" is described as an "egregor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>.

The core conflict between the Russian establishment and organizations like the "13 great world occult orders" is rooted in fundamental differences: the latter prioritize "freedom, enlightenment, and completely free knowledge without censorship," which are "completely rejected by the Russian establishment of the Russian government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>.

This pervasive reliance on the mystical and the irrational marks Russia's current state as a "new Middle Ages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>, characterized by a lack of rational governance and an elite desperate for miraculous interventions to escape their impending fate.

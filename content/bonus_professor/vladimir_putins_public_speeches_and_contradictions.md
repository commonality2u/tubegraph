Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, in episode 42 of "What's Happening," discussed the public speeches of the Russian president, highlighting their contradictory nature and impact on public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Contradictory Statements and Logic

The presenter notes that [[Criticism of the Russian President's speech | Vladimir Putin's statements]] are often internally contradictory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This is described as a "pathologically sick logic of a pathologically sick consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Despite the contradictions, the president himself believes his statements are consistent and accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### "Everything is Going According to Plan"

One recurring theme in the president's speeches is the assertion that "everything is going according to plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. However, the speaker questions this claim, asking why no one has been notified about this plan, implying that any negative outcome could then be retrospectively labeled as "planned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### No Mobilization (for now)

[[Vladimir Putin's public speeches and contradictions | Putin]] publicly stated twice last week that there would be no mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. While this public assurance is noted, a reservation was made by the president that "at the moment there is no need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This caveat suggests that a need for new people could arise in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Nuclear Weapons and Preventive Strikes

Regarding nuclear weapons, [[Vladimir Putin's public speeches and contradictions | Putin]] stated that Russia is not ready to be the first to use them, but if they are not used first, there might not be another chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This leads to discussions about "preventive strike" concepts, which the United States has developed, while Russia's concept is a "response to a counterstrike" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. These statements, coupled with the assertion that the "growth of the nuclear threat is happening in the West," were widely interpreted as a readiness to use nuclear force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Reliability of Promises

The speaker challenges the credibility of the president's promises, citing past instances where [[Vladimir Putin's public speeches and contradictions | Putin]] allegedly went back on his word, such as not raising the retirement age, not running for a third term, and promises about Russia's economic prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Public Perception and Impact

The "bravura statements" that "everything is going according to plan" and that Russia's nuclear shield is in "perfect order" are described as not corresponding to reality, especially given the state of affairs in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The speaker suggests that the president's logic is distinct from "usual normal Czech logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

Closed sociological surveys, including those ordered by the Kremlin, indicate that even "Turbo Patriots" who follow military Telegram channels and TV propaganda are now disappointed in the army and [[Russian political dynamics and Putin's public appearances | Putin]] himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This disillusionment is attributed to military defeats, such as the loss of Kherson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. These "Turbo Patriots" are reportedly willing to sacrifice new territories for peace, as they see no sense in the cost of acquiring them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

It is suggested that [[Russian political dynamics and Putin's public appearances | Putin's popularity]] is at record lows, and societal discontent is rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. This is seen as a key reason for [[Vladimir Putin's public speeches and contradictions | Putin's]] repeated assurances that there will be no mobilization and that "everything is fine," aiming to prevent further public unrest among a population already under stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

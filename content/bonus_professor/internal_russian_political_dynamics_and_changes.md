The week's main event for the Russian Federation was the trip of the "so-called president," referred to as a double named Evgeny Vasilyevich, along with a representative delegation, to Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This visit was orchestrated by the "real masters of Russia" who "sent him to Beijing" to "receive a label from the Chinese Bogdykhan to reign in Moscow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Moscow's Objectives in Beijing

The Kremlin's goals for this visit included:
*   **Legitimization of the Double**: To gain acceptance from China for the "double" as president, hoping the world would follow suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Pressure on Ukraine Summit**: To ask China to pressure the Russian Federation to not participate in the Swiss summit on Ukraine, something the Kremlin was unable to do on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Continued Military Support**: To secure guarantees of ongoing Chinese support for military operations against Ukraine, as Chinese aid is "critically important" militarily and economically for Russia's stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Without it, Russian military actions would subside within months, and the economy would likely not last longer than six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Bank Payments Resolution**: To resolve the issue of bank payments stuck in Chinese banks or being returned, which significantly hinders mutual trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Power of Siberia 2**: To obtain China's consent for the construction of the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Beijing's Objectives and the "Secret Agreement"

Beijing had two main goals for the visit:
1.  To observe the "new composition" of the [[Russian political dynamics and power consolidation | Russian leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
2.  To assess Moscow's readiness to fulfill a "secret agreement" signed by the "late Russian President Vladimir Putin" with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in February 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### The Secret Treaty and "National Treason"
This secret agreement, hidden from Russian society, stipulates that China receives a 49-year lease of "gigantic territories" in Siberia and the Far East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This lease includes the right to develop natural resources and establish Chinese administration, effectively removing these territories from the Russian Federation's jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This agreement is described as "an act of national treason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

China wanted to confirm Russia's commitment to this treaty, which is set to take effect on January 1, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The Kremlin, conversely, sought to postpone its implementation due to fears of a "monstrous scandal and domestic political crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. China did not provide a definitive answer regarding the postponement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## Humiliation and Consequences of the Visit

The visit was marked by significant humiliation for the Russian delegation, with Russia acting as a "supplicant" and China as a "master" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Key figures like Sergei Chemezov and Nikolai Patrushev did not attend the Beijing visit, reportedly to avoid being associated with the "humiliating requests" and "insults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

*   **Treatment of the "Double"**: The so-called president was treated like a "pathetic doll" or "puppet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. During their purported "one-on-one" meeting, no strategic questions were discussed; only "praises of wisdom, strength, and strong-willed dignity of the Chinese leadership" were uttered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This meeting was not truly one-on-one, as a translator and people controlling the double from the Russian side were present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **Delegation Treatment**: Some Russian delegates were even denied access to toilets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   **Chinese Disregard for Russian Sovereignty**: An agreement on cooperation regarding Bolshoy Usuriysky Island, formally divided between the two countries, was signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. However, China considers the entire island its own and depicts it as such on its maps, to which the Russian side does not protest, hinting at Russia's readiness to accept further territorial concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Lack of Concrete Agreements**: China did not agree to any significant Russian requests, including on bank payments or the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Despite Russia's goal of preventing China from participating in the Swiss summit on Ukraine, China indicated willingness to send a delegation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## The Appointment of Belousov and Future Changes

The Chinese showed a "noticeable interest" in Belousov, seen as a "new strong man of the Russian government," and sought a reliable counterparty for business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Belousov's appointment was reportedly a result of a "fantastic coincidence" or "skillfully conducted intrigues," revealing a "new alignment within [[Russian internal political dynamics and leadership issues | Russian politics]]" and a "new balance within the elite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

The overall outcome of the meeting is considered "frankly dangerous for Russia" because the "territorial integrity and national sovereignty of the Russian Federation have been called into question" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. The current Russian leadership is, at least in part, ready to implement this act of national treason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

Forthcoming changes in [[russian_internal_politics_and_economy | Russian internal politics]] are anticipated, including the resignation of Mishustin and a radical renewal of the Cabinet of Ministers in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. These developments will undoubtedly "shake Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

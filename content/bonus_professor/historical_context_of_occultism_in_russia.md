## Introduction
The fascination with [[occult_practices_in_russian_politics | occult practices]] and their perceived protective qualities is deeply rooted in Russian history, particularly among the ruling elite. This phenomenon, which intertwines [[interplay_of_religion_and_occult_practices | occult and political spheres]], is understood by some as a means of counteracting perceived negative realities and challenges [00:04:21, 00:19:03].

## Historical Trajectory of Occult Interest
Interest in [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | occultism and magical practices in Russia]] within high echelons of power dates back at least to the early 2000s [00:07:15, 00:07:23]. This initial interest was reportedly fueled by the perceived predictive abilities of certain individuals [00:07:28]. The success of the Russian president was directly linked to the presence of one such person; things went well while this individual was alive, but deteriorated after their death [00:07:36, 00:07:50].

A lasting "imprinting" from this period led to a continued search for "wisdom," "miracles," and a "ring of omnipotence" among Russian rulers [00:08:03, 00:08:16]. This quest, particularly noted among Chekists since the 1920s, initially explored Orthodoxy as a means to find identity and an instrument of power [00:08:18, 00:08:26, 00:08:35]. However, Orthodoxy was soon deemed incapable of providing what was needed [00:08:42, 00:08:52].

By the early 2000s, attention shifted to other practices, including Eastern esotericism [00:08:57, 00:09:04, 00:09:10]. The depth of this engagement was such that it influenced figures like Pelevin, who reportedly learned about its "interface" from practitioners [00:09:36, 00:09:41].

## Shifting Focus: From Prediction to Influence
Around 2014, a significant shift occurred: the focus moved from merely predicting the future to actively influencing and changing it, especially as events began to unfold unexpectedly [00:10:05, 00:10:13, 00:10:16, 00:39:31]. This intensified search led to the utilization of various, often potent, [[occult_magical_practices | magical practices]] [00:10:28, 00:11:16, 01:00:19]. The belief system of the supreme leadership, perceiving this reality as serious, directly influences decision-making processes [00:06:37, 00:11:02, 01:00:06].

An example of this quasi-rational attempt to explain magical abilities is the "nooscope," conceptually likened to a crystal ball for foreseeing the future [00:11:12, 00:11:33, 00:11:36].

## Case Study: Shaman Alexander Gabyshev
The forcible psychiatric commitment of self-proclaimed shaman Alexander Gabyshev illustrates the perceived threat of magical influence [00:03:00]. The President of the Russian Federation reportedly issued a direct order to sedate Gabyshev into a "vegetable state" or force him into private life, under surveillance, to prevent him from undertaking socially significant initiatives [00:05:01, 00:05:13, 00:05:19]. This action occurred days after Gabyshev announced he had performed a ritual to "drive out evil spirits from the Kremlin" [00:05:30, 00:05:40, 00:05:51]. Similar measures were taken in September of the prior year when Gabyshev reached Buryatia [00:06:08, 00:06:10].

Gabyshev belongs to a "cultural type of shamans" whose worldview is based on mythology and folklore, particularly the Siberian-Mongolian "rite of the stolen soul" [00:12:43, 00:12:47, 00:12:50, 00:12:57]. This rite involves a shaman fighting a demon who stole a person's soul and returning it [00:13:16, 00:13:20, 00:13:30, 00:13:33, 00:13:40, 00:13:46]. Crucially, the person whose soul was stolen *must* participate in the ritual; it cannot be performed remotely [00:14:02, 00:14:06, 00:14:10, 00:14:17, 00:14:29]. Therefore, from a shamanic perspective, a ritual for Putin's soul could not be effective unless he participated [00:14:17, 00:14:19].

From a psychiatric standpoint, the use of psychiatry for punitive purposes, as seen in Gabyshev's case, is condemned as creating "even greater evil" [00:15:57, 00:16:00, 00:16:06]. Gabyshev is considered an ordinary person with a different worldview, comparable to Don Quixote [00:17:54, 00:18:05].

## The Role of Current Elites
The contemporary Russian elite, described as having "extreme mental instability," are deeply involved in these [[role_of_mysticism_and_esotericism_in_the_kremlin | mystical and esoteric pursuits]] [00:22:18, 00:22:21]. This behavior is attributed to their sudden rise to power ("chosenness") and a search for guidance and solutions to complex problems through intermediaries and operators [00:22:26, 00:23:02, 00:23:07, 00:23:16, 00:23:42, 00:23:44]. The current situation is considered unprecedented in Russian history in its scale of engagement with occult practices, far exceeding the imperial court's fascination with Rasputin [00:21:46, 00:22:05].

Some elements of the Russian elite operate in a "shifted reality," influenced by [[sociopolitical_implications_of_occult_beliefs | hallucinogenic experiences]] from alkaloids that induce "rapid personal transformation of degradation" and can lead to schizophrenia [00:34:59, 00:35:09, 00:32:32, 00:32:35, 00:33:05, 00:33:13, 00:33:15]. These individuals make political and financial decisions while in such altered states [00:35:18, 00:35:22].

## Modern Occult Practices and Their Implications
Modern [[occult_rites_and_political_synchronization_in_russia | occult rites]] for the elite are highly theatrical and often involve blood and horror, considered to be the most effective [00:46:27, 00:46:33, 00:46:37]. Two relevant practices in Moscow are:

*   **Water Cult (Voodoo variant):** The "toughest, bloodiest direction" involves digging up a fresh corpse (preferably of a maniac or suicide), dismembering it, mixing parts with grave soil in a barrel, and adding a carved wooden "chicherina" doll [00:46:48, 00:46:58, 00:47:04, 00:47:07, 00:48:00, 00:48:04, 00:48:14, 00:48:17, 00:48:22, 00:48:52, 00:48:56, 00:49:00]. Live birds are placed on copies of the doll and must die in agony to "cleanse" the grave soil [00:48:25, 00:48:28, 00:48:32, 00:48:35, 00:48:39]. The doll is then soaked in a composition of blood (human, not animal) and plant juice, buried in the grave soil, and later "fed" with "the blood of a virgin and the sperm of men" [00:49:25, 00:49:30, 00:49:34, 00:49:37, 00:49:43, 00:49:47, 00:49:50, 00:49:54, 00:49:57, 00:50:00, 00:50:03, 00:50:06, 00:50:08]. Iron objects are then driven into the doll as part of a ritual, and one doll is sent to the intended victim [00:50:27, 00:50:29, 00:50:38, 00:50:41]. The psychological impact on the victim is paramount [00:50:47, 00:50:51, 00:50:53, 00:50:56].
*   **Santa Muerte Cult:** This practice involves using a decayed human corpse, preferably of an influential person, which is washed, adorned with incense, gold crowns, and jewelry [00:46:50, 00:51:54, 00:51:59, 00:52:03, 00:52:05, 00:52:09, 00:52:13, 00:52:16, 00:52:21, 00:52:23, 00:52:27]. Followers often keep a human skull of an ancient, influential person in their homes, believing a "fool's skull" would make them foolish [00:52:43, 00:52:47, 00:52:50, 00:52:53, 00:52:55, 00:53:50, 00:53:53].

These practices are not openly discussed but are evident in the behavior of high-ranking officials and the public information surrounding them [00:59:22, 00:59:32, 00:59:40, 00:59:42, 00:59:45, 00:59:51, 01:00:00]. This phenomenon is a "colossal business," with operators performing rituals for "colossal money" [00:38:33, 00:38:36, 00:38:51, 00:38:53, 00:38:57, 00:39:00].

## Occult Warfare and Broader Implications
Some participants in these circles believe they have entered an "occult war" against two or three "very powerful" orders, possibly referring to 13 world [[historical_and_contemporary_perspectives_on_black_magic | occult orders]] [00:39:43, 00:39:46, 00:39:48, 00:39:51, 00:40:20, 00:40:23, 00:40:25, 00:40:28]. This perception of conflict influences their actions and their continued resort to increasingly potent means [00:40:09, 00:40:13, 00:41:16, 00:41:19].

The traditional Russian Orthodox Church initially tried to deny and condemn these non-traditional occult practices, then adopted a calm approach, and in some cases, even participated in them, with some clergy believing it is a "real path to power" [00:55:08, 00:55:11, 00:55:15, 00:55:18, 00:55:22, 00:55:24, 00:55:30, 00:55:32, 00:55:36, 00:55:39]. Unlike 10 years ago when there was an attempt to return to Orthodox roots, the last 5-6 years have seen a clear departure from it [00:56:40, 00:56:42, 00:56:46, 00:56:48, 00:56:52]. The church's influence is diminished, partly due to its historical oversight by the State Security Committee (KGB) and its current inability to act [00:58:40, 00:58:42, 00:58:45, 00:58:48, 00:57:20, 00:57:22, 00:57:23, 00:57:26, 00:57:29, 00:57:34, 00:57:36].

The current situation is characterized by a "colossal instability" of the modern sociopolitical world and within Russia, leading to uncertainty among its leaders [00:55:50, 00:55:54, 00:55:58, 00:25:50, 00:25:54, 00:25:56, 00:25:59]. This internal chaos pushes them to seek "cover" in perceived masters of the occult [00:28:02, 00:28:05, 00:28:09, 00:28:13].

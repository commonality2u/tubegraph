## Digital Control

The idea of "digital physical slavery" was never part of Patrushev's group's intentions, though they did aim to strengthen control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The digital ruble was one element of this control, but not in an "apocalyptic spirit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. The speaker also states that the organizational and technical aspects for mobilization are ready, including the functioning of a "weight register" and public services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

## Societal Moods and Political Participation

The speaker notes that new sociological data regarding societal moods is not readily available to them, and no extraordinary information from closed sources has been reported recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

Regarding elections, the speaker observes that they are conducted in a "derogatory, offensive to common sense, dignity manner," which might make participation not truly worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. However, if there are still elements of competition or a favored candidate, voting is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

## Envisioned Societal Changes and Reforms

The speaker's team plans significant changes to improve the lives of the populace.

### Leadership and Governance
The speaker's team has multiple "highly worthy" candidates for the presidential chair, expressing confidence in their recognizability and chances of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. Upon gaining power, the team intends to maintain constant "reverse direct feedback" with society to understand public sentiment, moving away from the current "humiliating, offensive, comedic" communication style seen in presidential direct lines or press conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.

### Economic Reforms and Social Policies
[[economic_reforms_and_social_policies | Economic reforms and social policies]] are a key focus:
*   **Salaries and Income:** Salaries for professionals such as teachers, doctors, and Ministry of Emergency Situations employees, as well as pensions and social payments, are planned to increase significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. The speaker believes that the country possesses sufficient funds to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
*   **Import Duties:** Duties on imported cars (from the USA and Japan) will be "significantly reduced" to saturate the market and satisfy demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>, before focusing on developing Russia's own automobile industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:02:00">[22:02:00]</a>.
*   **Loan Debt Relaxation:** After a change of power, a relaxation regarding large bank loans is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:00">[22:30:00]</a>. Individuals are advised to prioritize their families' survival over strict loan repayment if it jeopardizes their well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39:00">[22:39:00]</a>.

### Healthcare and Education
The speaker's team plans comprehensive reforms in healthcare and education, aiming for "good, understandable reforms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. A primary goal is to reduce paperwork for teachers and doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. The Unified State Exam (USE) is viewed as a good method for assessing grades and ensuring social mobility, allowing students from remote regions to enter elite universities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>.

### Rural Development
The speaker believes that some villages can be revived by injecting not just money, but also [[technological_revolution_and_societal_impact | technology]] to change the quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>. The goal is to provide people in Russia, who have "earned the right to a decent life," with better living conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:00">[19:40:00]</a>.

### Law Enforcement and Justice
The speaker acknowledges that many law enforcement representatives are "quite decent people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>. Changes in the system will begin gradually, with those who committed crimes against society being punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>. A special service or department will be created to restore the constitutional rights of citizens violated over the past 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:00">[21:04:00]</a> and propose punishment for those responsible for these violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:26:00">[21:26:00]</a>.

### Military
Following the Russian-Ukrainian conflict, the experience suggests a transition to a "contract professional army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:46:00">[18:46:00]</a>.

### Amnesty
A broad amnesty for political and "near-political" articles will be enacted after the fall of the current regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. There will also be rehabilitation for those "innocently convicted and suffered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>.

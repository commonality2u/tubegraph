Valery Solovey discusses the [[Economic Conditions in Russia|economic conditions in Russia]], particularly focusing on the ruble's stability and the potential for a denomination. He notes that [[economic_challenges_and_financial_management_in_russia|financial challenges]] are becoming increasingly severe for the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## Denomination Discussions and Rationale

The concept of ruble denomination has been under discussion within the Kremlin for the last two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Solovey notes that while some argue there is no financial or economic sense in denomination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, decisions by authorities are not always based on common sense. As an example, he mentions the decision to raise the retirement age, which he claims was made after a conversation with a shaman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

The monetary authorities are increasingly advocating for denomination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, claiming it is necessary to "remove the inflationary overhang" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a> and combat inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>. New money has reportedly been printed 1.5 to 2 years ago in anticipation of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. They view it as an effective tool to address the many accumulating financial problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## Ruble Instability and Budget Deficit

[[russian_economic_challenges_and_ruble_instability|Inflation is growing in Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>, and the national currency rate is falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This decline has both tactical and strategic reasons:
*   **Tactical:** Companies like Shell are withdrawing, converting rubles into foreign currency that is then removed from the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
*   **Strategic:** Russia's budget is in an acute deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. The government aims to fill this deficit by weakening the ruble exchange rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. Economists from Alfa Bank have calculated that the dollar would need to reach 115 rubles to cover lost budget revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. Solovey expects the dollar to move towards 100-110 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

## Implications of Denomination and Advice for Citizens

A denomination process typically involves a reduction in the number of zeros on the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. During this period, deposits might be temporarily frozen to allow for recalculation and to prevent panic withdrawals, as people currently hold a large amount of cash â€“ tens of trillions of rubles according to some estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

Solovey offers advice on how to protect savings during these [[economic_challenges_and_consumer_behavior_in_russia|economic challenges]]:
*   **Buy currency:** He recommends buying currency, advising viewers to use any temporary strengthening of the ruble to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   **Digital dollars (USDT):** If familiar with cryptocurrency, digital dollars like USDT are suggested as a reliable means of saving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   **Hold cash:** Keep some part of savings in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.
*   **Make purchases:** Buy desired items now rather than postponing, as prices will inevitably rise due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

He emphasizes that the exact timing of denomination depends solely on the president and the general military-political situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. While it has been suggested for the fall, it might not happen then, or could even be implemented by a successor government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. Technically, everything is "more or less ready" for a denomination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>.

Regarding the US dollar, Solovey states that it will not be canceled in Russia and advises against selling dollars, as they are expected to increase in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. He highlights that the US currency maintains stability, which is crucial for financial well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

Citizens' personal [[socioeconomic_challenges_in_russia|socioeconomic challenges]] and daily concerns take precedence over events in Ukraine, unless family members are directly involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The number of denunciations in Russia has increased 128 times compared to the previous quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. However, Solovey believes that a significant portion of the Russian populace, an "active minority" of 15-20%, desires an honest way of life and will drive societal change if given the opportunity by new political and legal frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Political Implications

The speaker expects [[economic_challenges_and_political_crisis_developments_in_russia|serious political crisis developments]] at the end of the "special military operation," leading to significant suffering for all current governmental institutions, structures, and high-ranking individuals, including Patriarch Kirill of the Russian Orthodox Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. He predicts the church will emerge from this crisis "very much suffered and ragged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

The speaker dismisses rumors about an 80% plus result for Putin in the 2024 presidential elections, stating that Putin "will not go to the elections" and "will definitely not participate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. He anticipates "other events" will preclude Putin's participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

The potential for "fatal development of events" for Russia, Ukraine, and the world, specifically the use of tactical nuclear weapons, is increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. This risk is linked to Putin's deteriorating health and the possibility that he might make rash decisions, driven by a "strong hatred for the whole world" as he faces his physical end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.

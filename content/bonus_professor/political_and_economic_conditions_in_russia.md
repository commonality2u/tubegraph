Valery Solovey conducts a Q&A session, addressing various questions about the [[political_situation_in_russia | political situation in Russia]] and [[economic_conditions_in_russia | economic conditions in Russia]].

## Economic Outlook and Policy
### Currency and Real Estate
In the event of a [[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_russia | serious political crisis]] in Russia, people tend to move into defensive assets like currency and potentially gold, causing currencies to rise in price [00:01:51]. Real estate prices, conversely, are expected to decrease [00:02:11]. The duration of the crisis is key: if short-lived, real estate could rebound, while currency values might stabilize or decline [00:02:14]. This is not investment advice, and personal circumstances (such as planning to leave Russia) should influence decisions [00:02:39]. Demand for real estate is currently declining, which may complicate future sales [00:03:04]. However, for those willing to hold assets for a "long game" (a couple or more years), holding real estate might ultimately be profitable [00:03:16].

### Pension Reform
A new government in Russia would need to address pension issues [00:04:31]. Key steps include:
*   Cancelling the increase in the retirement age [00:04:39].
*   Providing compensation for lost benefits to those affected by the retirement age increase [00:04:44].
*   Increasing pensions by reducing "non-productive expenses" [00:04:54].
However, a radical increase in pensions (2-3 times) is unlikely in the near future without a fundamental reform of the pension system itself, as the previous "reform" was merely an age increase [00:05:07].

### Post-Putin Economic Transformation
In a post-Putin Russia, all laws and by-laws that violated fundamental human rights are expected to be cancelled [00:23:16]. Those responsible for developing and initiating such laws would be punished [00:23:33]. A separate service might be created to protect citizens' rights and restore constitutional legality, providing compensation for those whose rights have suffered [00:23:56]. This process would be systematic, planned, and long-term [00:24:10].

Regarding state-owned companies like Gazprom, immediate privatization or dismemberment is not seen as necessary [00:05:23]. The first priority would be to implement effective management focused on national interests [00:05:32]. Partial privatization could be considered later when market conditions and company success allow for good sale prices [00:05:42].

The financial system would require revision of credit policies [00:57:38]. This would involve credit holidays and the state taking on some "irrevocable" debts [00:57:52]. The best long-term solution would be to foster [[economic_conditions_and_government_policies_in_russia_under_putin | economic growth and prosperity]] [00:58:05].

For Russians living abroad, opportunities to influence the future Russia are limited at present to financial assistance for worthy causes, and protecting the interests of Russian political prisoners through protests and solidarity events [00:30:35]. However, once Russia undergoes radical political and [[economic_challenges_and_political_crisis_developments_in_russia | economic transformations]], their knowledge, technologies, experience, and capital will be valuable [00:31:10]. This offers a pragmatic incentive beyond patriotism, as Russia will be a country with "very high margin" for earning [00:31:41].

## Political Landscape
### The Impending Crisis
Russia is anticipated to face a [[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_russia | serious political crisis]] [00:01:44]. This crisis is expected to be "very sharp, cardinal and large-scale" [00:27:27]. It is predicted that the "close chord" of events will stretch until the end of the year [00:03:31]. The year 2023 is seen as having every chance to become a decisive year for Russia, offering an opportunity to influence the country's destiny [01:15:10].

### Risk of "North Korea" Scenario
The notion of Russia transforming into a "plague Barack" (a North Korea-like state) is considered "extremely unlikely" [00:14:08]. While theoretically possible, it's practically improbable because even within the ruling elite and Chekist circles, there is no widespread desire to pursue such a path [00:14:13]. Although a group led by Nikolai Patrushev favors this option, they are not the sole or dominant force [00:14:25]. The [[socioeconomic_conditions_in_russia | socio-cultural landscape]] has changed over the past decades, and the Russian establishment does not wish to live in isolation but rather to enjoy the world [00:14:51].

### Political Transition and Human Rights
In a post-Putin Russia, all laws violating fundamental human rights are expected to be cancelled [00:23:16]. Those who developed or inspired these laws will be punished [00:23:33]. A new service, possibly within the Ministry of Internal Affairs or a separate entity, would focus on restoring constitutional legality and providing compensation to those whose rights were violated [00:23:56]. This would be a long-term, systematic effort [00:24:10]. The process of establishing democracy in Russia will be a gradual one, requiring active participation [00:35:13].

### Mobilization
A "demobilization chord" is expected to begin in late spring, or possibly early spring (March), and unfold in two stages: spring and autumn [00:04:04]. A new wave of mobilization is considered almost inevitable, with a likely start in late February or mid-to-late February [01:03:27]. This mobilization is described as "creeping" and ongoing [01:03:47]. The mobilization base has expanded significantly, now including those deprived of foreign travel for financial reasons (8 million), alimony payers (4 million), and 7 million in the potential mobilization base [01:06:36]. Conscripts, although legally exempt from active duty, could be sent to the front lines if a massive offensive with large human losses occurs under martial law [00:57:05].

### Societal Issues and Propaganda
Decades of deliberate Russian propaganda have shaped public perception, making the "absurdity of what is happening" visible to "normal, sane people" but not necessarily to those influenced by the propaganda [01:10:59]. There is a concern that the "deep people" might not support a democratic position if Putin falls [00:34:30]. However, cultural models and values can change relatively quickly over 10-15 years [00:37:47]. The state's current policy encourages informing on others, but this is expected to disappear when the state is no longer interested in such a climate [00:38:51].

## Geopolitical Stance
### Ukraine War and International Relations
The fulfillment of Andrey Kosmocha's forecasts is described as "extremely high" [00:06:51]. He confidently repeats that "decisive military events" will occur in March, developing from March to summer, in favor of Ukraine [00:07:14].

The possibility of Crimea becoming a battlefield is not excluded, with scenarios presented even to the Russian president [00:15:48]. Attacks on Ukrainian transport hubs, particularly railway tracks, are difficult to sustain due to quick restoration and the risk of accidental strikes on NATO territory (e.g., Poland), which could trigger Article 5 of the NATO Charter [00:16:10]. Russia is "very afraid" of this [00:17:19].

The question of using tactical nuclear weapons could move to a "practical plane" if Russian armed forces suffer a crushing defeat in spring/early summer [00:19:35]. While Putin has never removed this option from the agenda, there is a "high probability" that people from his entourage, who do not want Russia to become a pariah state or "North Korea," might try to interfere with such an order [00:20:36].

A "General battle" is expected to be a series of offensive and counter-offensive actions over several months [00:42:16]. Russian offensive activation began in February, with major offensives planned in several directions on the border, timed to coincide with the anniversary of the special military operation [00:42:27]. Putin is also timing "very important speeches" and significant steps, such as introducing military movement and announcing a second stage of mobilization, to the same anniversary [00:42:50].

Belarus is considered "extremely unlikely" to enter the war [00:53:34]. The current status of Transnistria is expected to change within the next five years, linked to the crisis in Russia, as Russia would likely be unable to hold it during such a crisis [00:39:50].

Regarding assistance to Ukraine, delays in arms supplies are attributed to two factors: some European countries do not want Ukraine to win on the battlefield and prefer a compromise with Russia, and a lingering fear of Putin's unpredictability as a leader with a nuclear arsenal [00:59:02]. However, this fear is currently lower, and the Americans have "bet on Russia's military defeat," which they believe should lead to [[impact_of_political_changes_in_russia | political changes]] in Russia [00:59:40].

### Future of Russia's Statehood
Russia has a historical chance to shed its imperial and colonial legacy and for its people to be "lucky" [00:26:23]. The current attempt to recreate the empire is seen as unnecessary and lacking ideological, moral, or propaganda grounds [00:26:39]. Russia is expected to become a "Democratic republican state" [01:07:53]. The reburial of Lenin's body in a national military cemetery is suggested [01:01:14].

### Role of Media and Opposition
Official propagandists in Russia have unparalleled influence due to their significant media resources and audience reach, despite a general decrease in their audience [00:45:48]. Opposition bloggers are also influential [00:46:07]. The speaker avoids publicly stating his attitude towards individual opposition figures, instead focusing on agreeing or disagreeing with their views, welcoming the presence of different opinions, even those he considers "erroneous" or "idiotic" [00:28:21].

Navalny's team is seen as reluctant to communicate with other opposition groups because they consider themselves to hold key assets (organizational, media, symbolic) and believe others should follow their lead [00:52:05]. However, the speaker believes this is "not very correct" and that the dynamics are currently not in Navalny's team's favor [00:52:35]. It is hoped that different opposition groups will eventually reach an agreement [00:52:51].

## Internal Political Situation
### Succession and Putin's Doubles
The question of Putin's potential successor, particularly Dmitry Patrushev, is a concern for "several Muscovites" [01:06:04]. The use of doubles for Putin is acknowledged [00:12:53]. These doubles were prepared to control the situation for some time after Putin's death, implying that his death might not be immediately announced [01:04:12].

### Access to Classified Archives
Top state officials, including heads of state and government, do not have access to highly secret documents like agent card files or intelligence activity records [00:24:40]. However, they can access broader "conditionally unclassified documents" [00:24:53], though they likely lack the time to do so [00:25:01].

### External Interference Concerns
Countries like France and other European nations extradite refugees, particularly those from Chechnya, based on national security considerations that may conflict with humanitarian aspects [00:43:31]. The decision to not close borders after the first mobilization was due to a lack of a legal basis, which now exists with a larger base of individuals restricted from leaving the country [01:06:25].

### Historical Context
From a historical science perspective, the Russian Federation's statehood emerged from two centers in the European part of the post-Soviet space: one in the northeast (which withered) and the other near Kyiv [00:50:17]. The powerful Muscovite state developed, with Moscow princes distinguishing themselves through absolute cynicism and opportunism in agreements [00:50:56]. The Russian Federation's right as the successor to the Soviet Union was recognized in 1991 by the international community [00:51:44]. The idea of a new Khazaria on part of Russia/Ukraine is deemed "phantasmagoric" [00:55:13]. In the early 70s, Lithuanians and Western Ukrainians, including some from Donbass, privately expressed desires for an independent state [00:06:06].

[[vladimir_putins_leadership_and_opposition_forces | Vladimir Putin]] retains control over governing levers, despite rumors of his removal from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. However, his current political strategies are characterized by a reluctance to appear in public with bad news and an unwillingness to bear responsibility for difficult decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. He has a habit of postponing or shifting responsibility onto others, including Moscow Mayor Sobyanin and Russian governors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Despite demanding actions from these regional leaders, he does not provide them with necessary resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Domestic Policies and Challenges

Russia's government, including the Kremlin, avoids declaring a state of emergency (which would require it by law) to evade financial and legal responsibility to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. This contrasts with the actions of Western countries and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

### Economic Strategy
Russia's budget is critically dependent on oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Based on government estimates, if the status quo is maintained, Russia's reserves may only last until October or November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. To address this, there are proposals to limit expenses and devalue the ruble to 100 per dollar to compensate for lost budget revenues, though [[vladimir_putins_leadership_and_opposition_forces | Putin]] has resisted this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

Even at $25 per barrel, Russia could potentially make ends meet by changing management, stopping widespread theft, and cutting non-core expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. However, [[vladimir_putins_leadership_and_opposition_forces | Putin]]'s current lack of self-confidence in his actions is a significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Previously seen as a factor of stability, he has now become a factor of destabilization for the first time in 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

### Response to Crises
[[vladimir_putins_leadership_and_opposition_forces | Putin]] is unwilling to accept responsibility and make tough decisions, which is theoretically a strength of authoritarian regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. He has been reluctant to take on difficult economic decisions and implement administrative and police measures, such as introducing curfews or using armed forces for quarantine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. This hesitation has led to massive public disappointment, with sympathy among his electorate turning to hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

## Foreign Policy and Geopolitical Manoeuvres

### OPEC+ Deal
[[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Russia's decision]] to leave the OPEC+ deal was made personally by [[vladimir_putins_leadership_and_opposition_forces | Putin]], not Sechin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. The form of Russia's refusal was considered offensive by Saudi Arabia and other OPEC participants, leading to a strong personal conflict between [[vladimir_putins_leadership_and_opposition_forces | Putin]] and the Saudi Crown Prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. The Crown Prince has repeatedly refused to speak with [[vladimir_putins_leadership_and_opposition_forces | Putin]] on the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.

A contributing factor to this conflict is Saudi Arabia's belief that the Kremlin was involved in leaking information about the Khashoggi scandal through its agents and media in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>. The alleged motive for this was to isolate Saudi Arabia through sanctions and European hostility, pushing them into Russia's arms, as evidenced by improved relations between Russia and Saudi Arabia shortly after the scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>.

Ultimately, Russia may have promised the US it would cease support for Venezuela, including evacuating Maduro, in exchange for American assistance in the OPEC+ deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>. This aligns with the US goal of restoring order in its "backyard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>. Russia hopes that if the asset growth of oil becomes state property, Venezuela might be saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>. Russia is currently in a position where it is ready to agree to almost any terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>.

### Ukraine Strategy
[[putins_strategy_for_ukraine | Putin's intentions regarding Ukraine]] remain absolutely unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:41:00">[24:41:00]</a>. The Kremlin expects Ukraine to turn to Russia for help, particularly in terms of medical assistance, given the current crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36:00">[24:36:00]</a>. They believe this is a "very good option" to utilize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:31:00">[24:31:00]</a>. The Kremlin had placed a significant bet on Yermak, head of the Ukrainian president's office, viewing him as a potential "Sherpa" to influence Ukrainian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:48:00">[25:48:00]</a>.

If Russia considers it necessary to pressure the Ukrainian leadership or distract its own society from internal problems, there is a very great threat of a war outbreak in Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:13:00">[52:13:00]</a>. Donbas is also seen as an important, manageable electoral resource for Russia, with plans to formally increase the number of Russian passport holders there to one million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:26:00">[49:26:00]</a>.

### US Elections
[[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin]] considers the results of US elections quite important and would like Trump to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:39:00">[52:39:00]</a>. He will try to help Trump, potentially by providing information about the Biden family in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:46:00">[52:46:00]</a>.

### Sanctions Relief
Russia is actively promoting the idea of lifting sanctions due to the global economic and medical challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:49:00">[30:49:00]</a>. While the US is expected not to tighten sanctions and might even try to soften them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:26:00">[31:26:00]</a>, it is unlikely the European Union will lift them entirely, as decisions are made by consensus, and the EU's diplomatic department is currently preoccupied with its own issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:02:00">[32:02:00]</a>. Lifting sanctions is more likely if a peaceful status and understanding are achieved between Russia and Ukraine regarding Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:00">[33:01:00]</a>.

## Internal Political Instability

The political and state structure in Russia, known for the last 20 years, is beginning to collapse rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:49:00">[33:49:00]</a>. This process could take on an "avalanche-like character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:59:00">[33:59:00]</a>. The authorities may become concerned not with lifting sanctions, but with their own survival and confronting internal political issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:00">[34:03:00]</a>.

[[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin]] initiated constitutional changes, which were seen as generally senseless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:35:00">[34:35:00]</a>. His idea of renewing presidential terms caused general anger, and it is believed he would not be able to take advantage of these changes anyway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>. This process of undermining the regime's foundations through constitutional changes and mockery of laws is seen as a "mockery of any laws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:28:00">[51:28:00]</a>.

Perceptions within [[russian_political_elite and putin | Putin's inner circle]] suggest that his luck has run out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>. Every day plays against [[vladimir_putins_leadership_and_opposition_forces | Putin]] and the government, with public moods worsening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00:00">[36:00:00]</a>. Prognoses indicate that many people currently at the top of the Russian political system will not be part of the final configuration after the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:10:00">[46:10:00]</a>. Part of the ruling elite is already considering how to preserve their positions and properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:15:00">[47:15:00]</a>. New political figures are expected to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:27:00">[47:27:00]</a>.

Russia's long-term sanctions and supposed import substitution programs are considered a propaganda myth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:47:00">[38:47:00]</a>. The country's dependence on imports is very large, and it cannot even produce enough masks or conduct sufficient testing for the epidemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:06:00">[39:06:00]</a>. This demonstrates the system's initial inefficiency and inability to mobilize, even preventing the purchase of necessary supplies due to taxes and customs duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:08:00">[40:08:00]</a>.

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The "mutual exposure of the opposition" has been identified as a key topic of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This refers to the ongoing conflict within the Russian opposition, which includes discussions between [[coalition_conflicts_in_russian_politics | Navalny]]'s team, particularly Volkov, and others like Ienedictov, the former editor-in-chief of Echo of Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.

## Nature of the Conflict

The discussion within the opposition has not yet escalated to outright "foul language," but it is characterized by some individuals attempting to adopt a moral and cultural stance, aiming to present themselves as morally superior figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. This quarrel has evolved into a "howling abuse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.

## Expert Commentary on the Conflict

Valery Solovey has stated his policy of not commenting on individual personalities within the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. He emphasizes that all individuals are "on the same side of the barricade" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. He views commenting on such internal conflicts as "pointless and counterproductive," as it only contributes to negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

Solovey draws a parallel to a quote by Mark Aldanov, who noted that if communists hated the bourgeoisie as much as they hated each other, a world revolution would have occurred long ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Applying this, he suggests that if the [[impact_on_russian_opposition | Russian opposition]], whether liberal or patriotic/conservative, genuinely wanted to fight the regime, they would have a chance to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

## Beneficiaries of the Conflict

The primary beneficiaries of this internal conflict are identified as the "second service of the FSB" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a> and the Presidential Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. The Presidential Administration benefits by observing the opposition "drowning each other" without needing to intervene directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>. This indicates manipulation and exploitation of internal divisions by elements within the government and security services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

## Losers of the Conflict

The clear losers of this internal struggle are the opposition itself and [[impact_on_russian_opposition | Russian society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. Russian society, observing these conflicts, often expresses disillusionment, questioning if the opposition is any better than the Kremlin, and adopting a cynical view: "a plague on both your houses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. This dynamic indicates that the balance of the conflict is not in favor of those who initiated and actively participate in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

## Stance on Accountability
The political force supported by the speaker holds a "definitely positive" view on investigating war crimes and punishing those responsible after the end of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

## Prosecution of Crimes
Individuals guilty of crimes against humanity and [[international_investigation_and_accountability | war crimes]] must be identified, found, and brought to justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. This applies to all participants, regardless of their side during the [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | armed actions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

Specific actions considered criminal offenses include:
*   Beating protesters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   Handing down sentences that violate the law and the Constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   Lack of justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Those found guilty of these offenses will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Lustration of Court Employees
All court employees are planned to undergo lustration without exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Lustration is considered "more than sufficient punishment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, though it is not a form of criminal prosecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

Regarding free service housing given to judges, prosecutors, and National Guardsmen, the speaker is unsure if it should be taken away, considering lustration sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. The issue of pensions for such employees is currently under discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Valery Solovey discusses the recent changes in the Russian government, emphasizing that his analytical predictions regarding the [[potential_government_reforms_and_policies_in_russia | Russian political situation and governance issues]] proved to be 85-90% accurate due to skillful use of insider information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. He highlights two key predictions that materialized: a sharp increase in turbulence connected with the new government formation, and the continued dominance of the Chemezov and Patrushev coalitions, whose conflict will define the main content of [[russian_internal_politics_and_economy | domestic Russian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## The Prime Ministerial Appointment Process

Contrary to claims that Mikhail Mishustin's appointment as Prime Minister of the Russian Federation was predetermined, Solovey asserts that nothing was set in stone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. He reconstructs the retrospective of the process:

*   **Initial Plan**
    *   From late November to mid-February, it was understood that Dmitry Patrushev would become Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   This plan anticipated a radical government renewal (75-80%) and Dmitry Patrushev becoming the heir to the "so-called President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Resistance and Stalemate**
    *   By February 15, the Patrushev coalition's plans faced strong, seemingly insurmountable resistance from the Chemezov coalition, which was "categorically against" Dmitry Patrushev becoming Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    *   This led to a stalemate: Dmitry Patrushev was the candidate from Nikolai Patrushev's coalition, while Denis Manturov was the candidate from the Chemezov coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Each group blocked the other's preferred candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Compromise Figures**
    *   Compromise options included Anton Vaina, head of the presidential administration, who refused the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   Another security official was considered as a second compromise candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
    *   Alexey Dyumin appeared as a third candidate in the final days of April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **China's Influence**
    *   China played a decisive role, advocating for Mishustin to become Prime Minister because he personally appealed to Xi Jinping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
    *   Mishustin promised to fulfill all obligations to China that were assumed by the "late President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
    *   The Chinese comrades agreed to arrange a visit to Beijing for the "so-called president" (Putin's double) in mid-May, conditional on Mishustin's appointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Elite Conflict and Appointments

The intense struggle between the elite factions saw various developments:

*   **Shoigu and Military Leadership Changes**
    *   Plans extended beyond the arrest of a Ministry of Defense official (Ivanov) to the detention of Minister of Defense Shoigu himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
    *   This move was intended to increase the efficiency of financing and actions of the [[russian_military_leadership_changes | armed forces of the Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
    *   The appointment of Belousov as Minister of Defense instead of Shoigu was not a foregone conclusion, but the purge of Shoigu's deputies was anticipated and is now happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.
*   **Compromise in Government Roles**
    *   As a compromise in the elite conflict, it was proposed that both Denis Manturov (Chemezov's candidate) and Dmitry Patrushev (Nikolai Patrushev's candidate) would become vice-premiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
    *   Denis Manturov became the First Vice-Premier, while Dmitry Patrushev became a Vice-Premier, indicating a slight improvement in Chemezov's position within the socio-economic part of the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
    *   This "rotten compromise" also included a promise to Nikolai Patrushev that Dmitry Patrushev would become the new prime minister by the end of the year, with a potential transition to president in early next year (winter-spring) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## Nikolai Patrushev's Enduring Influence

Nikolai Patrushev's decision to "go into the shadows" was part of the compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. While his position in the socio-economic part of the government slightly worsened, his positions in the security bloc were completely preserved and even strengthened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

>[!NOTE] Importance of the Person over Position
>Solovey emphasizes that in the Russian system, the person's real political weight matters more than their official hierarchy or institutional role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>. For example, the role of the Security Council Secretary, now held by Sergei Shoigu, is considered an "absolute void" because the real control lies with the first deputy, Nurgaliev, and ultimately with Patrushev, who continues to lead the security forces from behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## Continued Turbulence and Elite Tension

The two opposing coalitions (Chemezov and Patrushev) remain in force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. The current compromise is not considered long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

>[!WARNING] Internal Tension
>Russia's critical dependence on China for military and economic support is a significant source of irritation and humiliation among the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. This, combined with the ongoing tension between the two powerful coalitions, is expected to lead to further, direct, and immediate discharge of tension, potentially involving bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

The speaker concludes that nothing in the government restructuring was predetermined, but rather it resulted from an intense and sharp struggle between elite factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. This struggle, described as "point against point," is expected to intensify sharply in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

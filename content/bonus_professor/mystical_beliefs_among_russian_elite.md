The Russian elite's engagement with [[Occultism and magical practices in Russia | occultism]] has intensified, particularly driven by the perceived "fear of [Putin's] death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> and a general sense of instability in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This phenomenon is characterized by diverse practices, from pyramid building to consulting mystics, reflecting a widespread belief in irrational solutions to political and personal challenges.

## Pyramids and Their Purpose

A significant manifestation of these beliefs is the construction of pyramids across Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Tomsk Pyramid:** Near Tomsk, a pyramid was built by United Russia deputies and prominent businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, designed by Valery Uvarov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, who is reportedly connected to Prigozhin's businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This location is notable for an archaeological discovery of late Bronze Age graves with Egyptian cultural artifacts, which were believed to have arrived via ancient trade routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Symbolism:**
    *   In the context of pharaohs, pyramids were seen as tombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
    *   In Russian "black ideas," they are imbued with mystical power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The suggested hierarchy within such a pyramid places a "subject of politics" at the top, "shamans" (former party workers) at the middle, and "Russian folk doctor Malakhov" (for prolonging life) at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Real-world impact:** A farmer in southern Russia who built a large pyramid claimed it cured his diseases and increased his cattle and crop yields, but he went bankrupt after a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## [[Russian presidential authority and worldview | Putin's]] Personal Engagement with the Occult

The increase in [[Occult practices in Russian politics | occult practices in Russian politics]] is believed to be directly influenced by [[Russian political elite and Putin | Putin]] himself, who is thought to seek healing and prolonged life, and whose aging and perceived "fading luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a> amplify these tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Non-Christian Rites:** In April of a recent year, [[Russian political elite and Putin | Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin)]] reportedly performed "very strange non-Christian rites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> with an "elder Nikifor" (a pseudonym) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. These rituals aimed at protecting his health and "induction of damage" on his enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Prophecies and Predictions:** Early in his presidency, [[Russian political elite and Putin | Putin]] consulted three fortune-tellers, none of whom knew whose future they were predicting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. All three delivered "almost identical predictions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>: he would rule for 20 years, but "the end of the reign will be terrible if he cannot change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. These predictions, though extensive, were delivered without the final paragraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. The missing part included phrases like "all twelve turn away from you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a> and a warning to "be afraid of part of the southern ruler of poisons husband of the state southern ruler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, interpreted as referring to Milosevic, Mubarak, and Gaddafi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. The implementation of these allegories, including mentions of Georgia and Ukraine, can be observed in Russian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. The belief in these predictions significantly guides the behavior of the establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **Loss of Luck:** The [[Russian political elite and Putin | elite's]] mystical belief in [[Russian political elite and Putin | Putin's]] luck is fading, especially since August 2020, marked by events like the Belarus revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a> and the weakening of Russia's influence in the South Caucasus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. This loss of perceived luck contributes to extreme nervousness and near-panic among those close to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

## Broader Trends Among the Elite

The widespread [[Influence of occult practices in Russian politics | occult influence in Russian politics]] extends beyond [[Russian political elite and Putin | Putin]].
*   **Personal Circumstances of Force Majeure:** The current "indefinite quarantine" with "unprecedented measures of isolation" suggests a fear of infection, particularly coronavirus, leading to a "tragic outcome" for someone under such circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. This prompts a "rationalist" to seek miracles in irrational manifestations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.
*   **Cynical Approach to Religion:** For [[Russian political elite and Putin | Putin]] and much of the integrated power structure, attendance at Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) events is largely a "protocol event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. While not excluding mystical elements, they view them as a miracle rather than faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>, seeing Christianity as a "religion of the flesh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. [[Russian political elite and Putin | Putin]], having a KGB background, is aware of the ROC's internal workings and harbors no illusions about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.
*   **Relic Worship and Deception:** A significant aspect of this search for miracles is the acquisition and use of human remains ("power") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.
    *   This practice, though "mercilessly exploited since ancient times by various religious cults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a> and forbidden by the Old Testament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>, continues.
    *   Examples of deception include two heads of John Chrysostom and the mummified, circumcised corpse passed off as Saint Alexander of Svir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>.
    *   Recent incidents include a man detained in Krasnoyarsk carrying a full skeleton, which was to be used to arrange an altar for Santa Muerte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. These "diggers" are at the lowest level, with "quite cynical educated people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>, including those with scientific degrees, at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.
*   **Santa Muerte Cult:** This syncretic Mexican cult combines Christian and traditional Mexican beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. Its altar requires a skeleton or skull, ideally from a "powerful person" like a general, as a "fool's" remains would yield "stupid" results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. There are three varieties:
    *   Black Death: For career growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.
    *   Golden Death: For wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.
    *   White Death: For worldly goods like love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.
    *   The purchase of these remains for such purposes costs hundreds of thousands of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>, considered insignificant by the wealthy elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.
*   **The Sirius Cult:** The billionaire Ilyumzhinov and others reportedly engage in the cult of Sirius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>, involving alleged interplanetary travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.
*   **Shamanism and Charlatanism:** There is a "sharp demand for esotericism, occultism" since 2014-2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. The elite follows "fashionable shamans" from Khakassia, Tula, and Altai Mountains, and even Amazonian shamans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>, often supplied by intermediaries who earn millions and coach the shamans on what the client wants to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>.
*   **Belief in a World Government:** Nearly half of the Russian population, including "practically all FSB officers" and a significant part of the financial sector, believe in a world government and seek a "pass" to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. They cannot believe in a chaotic world and think a "secret chancery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a> rules.
*   **Non-Public Organizations:** Beyond public display, there are influential "non-public organizations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a> with adherents in the Russian government and Western governments, influencing politics through actions like media campaigns and strong statements from Western leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. They believe in free will and do not engage in manipulation as commonly understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>.
*   **Conflict with Occult Orders:** Russian authorities reportedly have "insurmountable contradictions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a> with "13 great world occult orders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. This conflict stems from a perceived insult by the "great master" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>. These orders base their foundation on freedom, enlightenment, and uncensored knowledge, which is "completely rejected by the Russian establishment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. A ritual initiated by these 13 orders in Nepal on June 21 (summer solstice) is linked to changes in the geopolitical landscape, suggesting a loss of "luck" for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>.

## Current State and Outlook

The current situation in Russia is described as a "new Middle Ages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>, where people are poisoned, the government engages in "dense black magic rituals," and worships dead remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:09:13]</a>. The [[Power struggles within Russian elite groups | elite]] is experiencing a "feeling of deep line" and "deep nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>, fearing an inevitable collapse, akin to an avalanche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:47">[00:59:47]</a>. This demand for a "miracle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:57">[00:58:57]</a> is driven by the inability of traditional political and economic instruments to change reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.

Valery Nightingale, in the 123rd episode of "What is Happening," asserted that his analytical descriptions and predictions regarding the Russian government came true with 85-90% accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. This success is attributed to the skillful use of insider information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Key Predictions and Their Accuracy

Nightingale highlighted two key predictions that materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>:
1.  A sharp increase in turbulence connected to the formation of the new government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
2.  The existence and continued influence of two main coalitions: the Chemezov coalition and the Patrushev coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. The conflict between these groups, along with other elite factions, was predicted to define [[russian_political_analysis | domestic Russian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

Nightingale consistently covered the process publicly and in closed speeches, demonstrating that nothing was predetermined despite claims to the contrary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

## Evolution of the Prime Minister Appointment

The process of appointing the Prime Minister was a dynamic struggle:

### Initial Expectations (November to Mid-February)
From the end of November until mid-February, it was widely believed that Dmitry Patrushev would become Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This would lead to a radical renewal of the government by 75-80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. It was also anticipated that Dmitry Patrushev would become the heir to the "so-called President Putin," who is, in fact, described as a double, Yevgeny Vasilyevich, a carpenter from Mogilev, Republic of Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. This links to [[the_role_of_doubles_and_misinformation_in_russian_politics | the role of doubles and misinformation]].

### Stalemate and Compromise Candidates (Mid-February Onwards)
By February 15, the Patrushev coalition's plans faced strong, seemingly insurmountable resistance from the Chemezov coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. The Chemezov coalition categorically opposed Dmitry Patrushev becoming Prime Minister and then President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

A stalemate emerged with Nikolai Patrushev's candidate being Dmitry Patrushev, and the Chemezov coalition's candidate being Denis Manturov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. Compromise options were considered:
*   Anton Vaina, head of the presidential administration, who refused the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
*   A security official (unnamed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.
*   Alexey Dyumin, who appeared as a candidate in the "last days" of April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. [[potential_early_presidential_elections_in_russia | Dyumin was considered as a compromise candidate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>, but only for a short time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:48:00">[18:48:00]</a>.

### China's Influence
It was revealed that China advocated for Mikhail Mishustin to become Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Mishustin was favored by Xi Jinping personally because he promised to fulfill all obligations to China assumed by the "late President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. China's condition for the "so-called president's" (the double's) visit to Beijing in mid-May was Mishustin's appointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. This illustrates Russia's critical dependence on China militarily and economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>, a fact causing "very strong irritation" within the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.

## The "Rotten Compromise"

The appointment of Mishustin as Prime Minister, with Denis Manturov becoming First Vice-Premier and Dmitry Patrushev becoming Vice-Premier, was a "rotten compromise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. This arrangement was not considered long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>:

*   **Temporary Mishustin:** Mishustin's position is described as weakened, with Manturov and Dmitry Patrushev fighting for influence over the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>.
*   **Patrushev's Future:** Nikolai Patrushev was promised that Dmitry Patrushev would become the new Prime Minister by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. Subsequently, Dmitry Patrushev's transformation into president is expected in early next year, shifting the timeframe from fall 2024 to winter/spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. This relates to [[internal_political_strategies_and_succession_rumors_in_russia | succession rumors]].
*   **Patrushev "Going into the Shadows":** As part of the deal, Nikolai Patrushev "removed himself" from his official position, intending to go into the shadows while maintaining control over the security forces from behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. His power is derived from his person, not his position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>. Sergei Shoigu, as the new Secretary of the Security Council, is an "absolute void," with Patrushev's first deputy, Nurgaliev, controlling affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.

## Predicted Future Turbulence

The political struggle is expected to intensify sharply, with blood being shed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>. The two opposing coalitions — Chemezov and Patrushev — remain in force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>. This unstable balance between the two coalitions has been preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>, but the "rotten compromise" is not considered long-term, suggesting further turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>.

### Shoigu's Removal
The prediction that Shoigu's removal as Minister of Defense was highly probable, although not a foregone conclusion, was accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>. The purge of his deputies is expected to be almost complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>. The new Minister of Defense, Belousov, was not known beforehand, as Nightingale only reports what he knows for sure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>.

## Sources and Verification

Nightingale's insights come from constantly covered public and closed speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. He emphasizes that the official hierarchy in the Russian Federation means little compared to the real weight of individuals in the political world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>.

Nightingale suggests that listening to the [[role_of_general_svr_and_intelligence_leaks | General SVR's]] audio speeches can confirm these insights, noting that an audio recording released days before Mishustin's introduction was titled "Who is the new prime minister, Mishustin or Dyumina," reinforcing that nothing was predetermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>. The current outcomes are the result of an "extremely sharp struggle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a>.

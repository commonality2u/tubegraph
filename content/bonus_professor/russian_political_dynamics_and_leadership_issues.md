Discussions on [[russian_political_dynamics_amidst_leadership_changes | Russian political dynamics]] and leadership issues highlight a concerning lack of effective governance and internal power struggles, particularly during times of crisis. The current leadership is perceived as struggling with decision-making and execution, leading to significant public discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Leadership Challenges and Governance Failures

Observations suggest a state where "there is no vertical of power in Russia," leading to poor execution of decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. According to one commentator, the decisions made by the current leader are "not very well executed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. There is a perception that "physiological reasons" may be preventing adequate decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The state is described as capable of only "humiliate people and take from them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, rather than effectively providing support or services.

Mikhail Delyagin reportedly referred to the current power structure as "female able gangs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The public's perception of leadership is such that knowing "who ruled Russia and how" could "damage the psyche" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

## Internal Power Dynamics

A "small group" is described as "welded together by one chain and tied by common blood," indicating a tight-knit elite with no alternative path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This group, likened to a "Politburo," makes decisions, though even they reportedly find it difficult to understand the logic of the "helmsman" and are "scared" by his televised decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin's increasing influence has reportedly caused "discontent" among security forces and the Prime Minister, leading to infighting among various "groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. However, these power struggles are seen as superficial, not indicative of a significant shift in the balance of power within the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

## Economic and Social Policies

Examples of policy failures include:
*   A presidential proposal for 6.5% mortgages being met with skepticism from banks and the Central Bank, highlighting a disconnect between presidential will and financial reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   The Minister of Economic Development, Mr. Reshnikov, failing to secure interest-free loans from banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   The chaotic implementation of a "pass system" for movement, demonstrating poor management and a lack of understanding of everyday life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   The government's attempts to "kill a wedge" between the business community and the population through propaganda posters are expected to cause "strongest irritation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:42">[00:30:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:35">[00:31:35]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Future Outlook

Public opinion is sharply divided, with roughly equal groups believing the authorities are hiding the true picture of the epidemic, accepting official data, or using the virus threat to "cover up... sins and affairs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Approval for isolation measures has decreased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

Concerns about the future include:
*   The feasibility of holding the plebiscite on the constitution or autumn elections given mass negative moods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
*   The economic situation is expected to worsen significantly, leading to unemployment and problems in the financial sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:43">[00:37:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.
*   A significant portion of Russian families lack sufficient funds even for a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.
*   While mass protests are not anticipated immediately, local conflicts and "deviant behavior" are expected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:43">[00:40:43]</a>. However, a "turning point" in public consciousness is foreseen, potentially leading to demands for the "resignation of the president and government" and the formation of a "government of national saved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

The situation is seen as a matter of "physical existence" for the nation, requiring difficult and risky decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>. The fate of the country is believed to "depend solely on our actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>.

During a December 8th, 2022, broadcast, Valery Solovyov discussed the implications of statements made by the Russian President regarding [[potential_use_of_nuclear_weapons | nuclear weapons]]. The president's remarks to the Council on Human Rights and Civil Society Development on December 7th were analyzed for their deeper meaning and potential impact on [[nuclear_threat_and_international_tensions | international tensions]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>

## Russian Nuclear Doctrine

The Russian President stated that the Russian Federation's nuclear weapons are "considered only as a means of protection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. He further elaborated that Russia would only defend itself "by all available means" if "we have nothing else left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Interpretation of "First Strike"
> Solovyov highlighted a logical contradiction in the president's statement, interpreting it as a "recognition of Russia's ability to deliver the first nuclear strike" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. He questioned who would determine whether a strike is "counter" or "retaliatory," suggesting this decision would likely rest with the Supreme Commander-in-Chief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This ambiguity was deemed a "very dangerous statement" in its potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## Global Perception and [[risks_of_escalation_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction | Escalation Risks]]

The presenter suggests that the global community will perceive this stance as Russia believing that if they do not use nuclear weapons first, "then we will have no chance at all to survive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This interpretation underscores the potential for [[potential_military_actions_and_geopolitical_influences | significant geopolitical implications]] and heightened [[risks_of_escalation_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction | risks of escalation]].

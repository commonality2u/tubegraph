On February 18th, 2021, a joint live stream was held by Valery Soloviev and "Victor" representing the Generals of the SVR Telegram channel. The discussion centered on the evolving [[Russian domestic political situation|political situation in Russia]], particularly in the wake of [[Alexei Navalny]]'s return and the subsequent protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Alexei Navalny and Protest Dynamics

The return of [[Alexei Navalny]] to Russia was described as a heroic and courageous act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. However, the subsequent dynamics, particularly concerning the protests, did not meet initial expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

After [[Alexei Navalny]]'s return, a film about "Putin's palace" was released, garnering over 110 million views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Despite this massive viewership, only approximately 100,000 people participated in the protests, representing roughly 1.1% of those who watched the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This low turnout led to doubts about the effectiveness of the protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Critiques of the protests and [[Alexei Navalny]]'s organization (FBK) included:
*   Lack of organization and coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   Protesters lacked specific, clearly set goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   Slogans were deemed dubious, and not everyone was ready to protest solely for Navalny's release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   The act of self-sacrifice by [[Alexei Navalny]] was not sufficiently appreciated by the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   Communication between protesters and organizers was problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   The protests were perceived as aimless and lacking prospects for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   It was suggested that with just 500 brave and desperate people and better organization, the situation could have been "radically different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Despite these shortcomings, [[Alexei Navalny]] is currently seen as the leader of the [[Opposition dynamics in Russian political landscape|Russian opposition]] and a "very powerful force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. While mistakes were made, it is believed that FBK will learn from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The Generals of the SVR expressed readiness to support future protest actions and movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

The decision by FBK to suspend active protests was attributed to a combination of organizational flaws and the "moral weakness" and "unpreparedness of [[Russian sociopolitical dynamics|Russian society]]" for direct action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## Government's Position and Future Outlook

The current government is described as making "all possible mistakes" and acting "thoughtlessly but purposefully" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The authorities are seen as having lost touch with reality, with even sophisticated observers recognizing their errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Upcoming Duma elections are expected to be rigged, serving as another "serious enough trigger" for protest movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. The speaker emphasized that any revolution or significant change in a country relies on a "split in the elites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, and their activity, along with comrades, is precisely aimed at achieving this split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Putin's Health and Decision-Making
Information regarding President Putin's health significantly impacts many processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. It is believed that leaders like those in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, FSB, and armed forces also consider his health, recognizing that "guarantees that give a sick dying person are not equal to 0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

Putin is described as being "maniacally afraid" of his plans becoming public knowledge, which often leads to their cancellation or postponement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. The SVR Generals aim to interfere with his plans, believing this is a significant form of opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

Early presidential elections, initially planned for April 2021, were postponed and not even discussed due to these interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Similarly, the President's message to the Federal Assembly was postponed indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

Recent rumors in Moscow suggested that parliamentary elections might be postponed until early summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. Putin is reportedly more withdrawn and trusts almost no one, making it difficult to expect justified actions from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

## Putin's Inner Circle and Relationships

Putin primarily trusts Nikolai Patrushev and Yuri Kovalchuk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. Others, like Igor Sechin, hold less influence; Sechin is seen as an intriguer whom Putin uses when convenient but distances himself from otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. Sergei Kiriyenko is considered influential when taking responsibility for tasks, such as organizing elections or the constitutional vote, which Putin appreciates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

[[Alexei Navalny]] is regarded by Putin as a personal enemy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>, not a traitor. Putin "hates traitors," but he is willing to do a lot to deal with enemies, and he also "kills quite a lot" of people he has never met based on recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

### International Relations
Putin respects and fears any US president, ensuring minimal classic espionage on US territory during his reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. He has shifted to prioritizing hybrid warfare methods, including cyberattacks on the United States, France, and Germany, as a more effective approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

Putin also respects the Chinese leader, who holds "quite serious leverage" over him, leading Putin to fulfill "all the whims and desires of the Chinese leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

Angela Merkel and Recep Tayyip Erdogan are also respected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:35">[00:26:35]</a>. Erdogan is seen as Putin's "alter ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>, especially after Putin's intelligence helped Erdogan avoid a military coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>. Russia's relationship with Turkey was likened to the "Horde" acting on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. Putin is also expected to grant Lukashenko a $3 billion loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>.

## The Generals of the SVR Channel

The Generals of the SVR Telegram channel has become one of the most popular in Russia and the world, ranking fifth in Russia and 82nd globally in January 2021 by reach per post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. The channel aims to influence President Putin's decisions by exploiting his fear of manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.

The channel's claims of having real access to information are supported by:
*   Warning Valery Soloviev and others about assassination attempts in July 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>.
*   Describing [[Alexei Navalny]]'s poisoning in detail before official investigations were public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.
*   Publishing information about the President's health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>.
*   Releasing "sharp things" at strategic moments to maximize impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.

The channel plans to continue releasing incriminating materials, including those related to terrorist acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>. They also plan to publish materials on oligarchs like Usmanov and Deripaska, especially after [[Alexei Navalny]]'s call for sanctions against those supporting the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:41">[00:47:41]</a>. Usmanov is specifically accused of being "responsible for drug trafficking in Europe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.

## Reform of Special Services and Society's Role

It is believed that [[Russian political dynamics and power struggles|Russian special services]] can be reformed to serve society, citing Georgia's successful reforms under Mikheil Saakashvili as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>. The speaker emphasized that the main purge should begin with a complete lustration of the entire judicial corps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>.

Russian special services are considered "quite professional" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>. If the "criminal component" (murders, special operations, hybrid warfare) is removed and they focus on real external and internal threats, they can be preserved and brought to a "qualitatively new level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>. Failures like the Skripal poisoning or [[Alexei Navalny]] poisoning are seen as degradation of specific groups, not the entire special services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>.

The speaker advises the [[Russian political climate and opposition risks|Russian opposition]] to "seize the moment" as the government will make many mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>. Mobilizing the electorate is crucial, as many people are ready for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:31">[00:50:31]</a>. The degree of tension and radicalism in society has grown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:34">[00:51:34]</a>, and people who participated in protests expressed regret only for not being more active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>. It is asserted that playing by Putin's rules will not lead to victory; instead, when he prohibits something, the opposition should do the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:12">[00:52:12]</a>. The government is currently in its "worst position" since 1996, making it a critical time to exert maximum pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>.

Valery Solovey's program "Answers to Hot Questions" addresses queries regarding Russia's potential geopolitical shifts, particularly concerning its relationship with NATO and the European Union.

## Future Relations with NATO and the European Union

A question was posed regarding whether Russia's policy under a new government would aim for full integration into NATO and the European Union, making it a "full-fledged Eurohangar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.

The speaker believes that neither NATO nor the European Union are currently in a position to consider Russia's integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>. Instead, the primary goal for Russia, following a cessation of hostilities and the rise of new leadership, will be to establish normal working relations with [[Russias foreign policy strategy with Europe | European institutions]] and with NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. Consultations on this matter are reportedly already underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:25">[02:51:25]</a>.

This normalization is anticipated to occur in the foreseeable future, potentially within 2-3 years, and could include the lifting of most sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:11">[03:02:11]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics Influencing Foreign Policy

The discussion also touched upon internal Russian dynamics that could influence its foreign policy:

*   **Judicial Reform:** Under a new government, all judges, including those of the Supreme Constitutional Court, would be subject to lustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:21">[03:41:21]</a>. However, lower-level court apparatus employees would likely not be, as lustration for them would lead to "chaos" and "emptiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:14">[03:53:14]</a>. The principle of lustration of the entire judicial corps remains unconditional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:16">[04:46:16]</a>.
*   **Military and Security Apparatus:** The speaker notes the effectiveness of military counterintelligence within the FSB of Russia, suggesting it prevents resistance within military ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:06">[06:06:06]</a>. Despite this, generals are said to be able to influence hostilities and block some of Patrushev's decisions, as Sergei Viktorovich Mizov and his coalition hold significant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:05">[06:53:05]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Operations:** A "hybrid operation" does not necessitate a large military contingent, at least in its initial stages, meaning it can be carried out simultaneously with mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:18">[12:43:18]</a>. Part of [[Russias foreign policy strategy with Europe | hybrid operations]] involves the destabilization of European countries, especially those actively supporting Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:32">[34:47:32]</a>. Russia possesses an "extensive spy ring," usually managed by [[Russian foreign policy and military strategy | military intelligence]], which often operates under a foreign flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:00:52">[35:00:52]</a>.
*   **Dictatorship and Public Apathy:** The current dictatorship persists because many people are "satisfied" or afraid of change, preferring a "terrible status quo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:40">[16:40:40]</a>. The speaker argues that the dictatorship will only end when the people actively fight against it, even through "completely safe" forms of civic activity such as financial assistance or subscribing to Telegram channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:17">[17:30:17]</a>.

## Current Geopolitical Stance

*   **Nuclear Weapons:** The speaker claims that the current Kremlin team is limited in or has refused the use of nuclear weapons, unlike the "late dictator Vladimir Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:28:10">[26:28:10]</a>. These individuals are described as more realistic, understanding the risks of using tactical nuclear weapons and engaging in rhetorical threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:39:10">[26:39:10]</a>. There is an alleged oral agreement with the Americans that nuclear weapons will not be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:30">[27:00:30]</a>.
*   **Putin's Successor and International Recognition:** Despite assertions that Putin is no longer alive and is replaced by a double, the US continues to recognize him as the president of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:18">[27:08:18]</a>. The speaker questions why Americans should solve Russia's internal problems or "open our eyes" about the double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:41:25">[27:41:25]</a>. This inaction is attributed to the "cowardice" within Russian society itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:08:14">[28:08:14]</a>.
*   **Hybrid War Goals:** The ongoing hybrid war, initially desired by the "grandfather" (presumably Putin), now aims to divert the West's influence by keeping Western nations preoccupied with their own issues, thereby preventing aid to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:58:34">[28:58:34]</a>.
*   **Kazakhstan and Russian-speaking Population:** The speaker believes nothing terrible will happen to the Russian-speaking population in Kazakhstan, noting past tensions in the 1990s and early 2000s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:02">[08:48:02]</a>. A new government would use "civilized and peaceful" means to protect compatriots abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:38">[09:17:38]</a>.
*   **China Relations:** China provides political and military support to the Russian Federation on the condition that it remains silent about the origins of the COVID pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:59:16">[32:59:16]</a>. The speaker's team is against the diminution of Russian sovereignty and its transformation into a semi-colony of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:09:07">[25:09:07]</a>.
*   **Western Perceptions of Russia:** The speaker refutes claims heard by a listener that Western politicians and military openly desire to bring Russia "to its knees" or divide it into three parts, dismissing such statements as coming from "conspiracy sites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:50:00">[33:50:00]</a>.

## Economic and Social Policies (Under a New Government)

*   **Property Rights:** A new government would repeal all laws and by-laws that worsen living conditions and harm people, such as the comprehensive development of the territory (KRT) law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:16">[14:16:16]</a>. Compensation would be allocated to those who suffered, and a new "Department of Management or the Service for the Restoration of Constitutional Legality" would be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:16">[14:43:16]</a>.
*   **Economic Outlook:** There is a detailed economic program developed by General SVR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:40:24">[32:40:24]</a>. While the ruble has recently strengthened due to the tax period and export revenues, it is expected to fall, with a consensus forecast of 100-120 rubles per dollar this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:16">[20:43:16]</a>. A severe crisis and high inflation would precede a ruble denomination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:10">[40:10:10]</a>.
*   **Gasification:** The new team plans to address the gasification of villages and towns more intensively, while also considering economic efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:21:05">[25:21:05]</a>.
*   **Migrant Problem:** A comprehensive approach to the migrant problem would include reducing the visa regime and, if necessary, mass deportations of illegal citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:17:15">[35:17:15]</a>.
*   **Food Security:** While famine is not expected, a shortage of certain products, particularly cereals and possibly vegetable products, is possible due to potential crop failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:37:37">[41:37:37]</a>.

### Collapse of the Regime

The speaker reiterates that the long-awaited collapse of the regime will "definitely, definitely" come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:23">[19:00:23]</a>. He emphasizes that current events, such as arrests and changes in the political elite, are "incomparable with everything that has happened in the last 25 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:02:12">[20:02:12]</a>, indicating a significant crisis.

The withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson in mid-November 2022 marked a significant [[strategic_turning_point_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]] in the [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine Russia conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This event not only consolidated the strategic shift in Ukraine's favor that began around August-September but also firmly transferred the strategic initiative to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Impact of the Kherson Withdrawal

While the loss of Kherson was not a military catastrophe, it is viewed as a profound moral, psychological, and political catastrophe for the Russian leadership and establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Key consequences for Russia include:
*   **Loss of Faith in Victory** The Russian establishment has lost its belief in achieving victory and must now accept the inevitability of military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Putin's Diminished Standing** Putin is increasingly seen by the establishment as a "toxic loser," where everything he touches turns into its opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Internal Confusion and Censorship** The Russian propaganda machine is in disarray, unsure how to frame events, which is expected to lead to tightened censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Scapegoating** Those punished for the military setbacks will likely be the innocent, rather than those truly responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Search for an Exit** There is an intensified search for a way out of the impasse created by the "brilliant actions" of the supreme commander-in-chief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Elite Discontent** Elite discontent is significantly increasing, posing a fundamental threat to Putin's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Peace Proposals

Immediately following the withdrawal from Kherson, the Russian leadership received a peace proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. While details are still being clarified, the general outline of these proposals, reportedly agreed upon by Ukraine, include:
*   **Territorial Withdrawal** Russia to fully withdraw from Ukrainian territory, including the DPR and LPR, but excluding Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Crimea's Status** Crimea would receive an indefinite status for seven years, during which negotiations would be held. Crimea must be demilitarized, and the Black Sea Fleet must leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Demilitarized Zones** A 100-kilometer deep demilitarized zone is to be established along the borders of Russia with Ukraine and Belarus with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Heavy weapons are to be removed from these zones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Ukraine's Commitments** Ukraine promises not to join NATO for seven years and not to raise questions about joining the alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Transnistria** The Russian military base in Transnistria is to be moved back to Russia, and Russia will not interfere with Transnistria's integration into Moldova in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Immunity for Russians** A key aspect of the proposal, which potentially encourages acceptance within the Russian establishment, is the guarantee that Russian civilians, military, and political figures will not be subject to punishment, ensuring their freedom, security, and the preservation of at least some assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. However, it is expected that scapegoats will still be punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Reparations** Financial compensation for damage to Ukraine was not mentioned in the received materials but should be discussed during peace negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

### Indirect Signs of Russian Leadership's Seriousness

There are indirect signs indicating that the Russian leadership is taking these peace proposals seriously:
1.  **Tactical Nuclear Weapons Plans** Plans for the use of tactical nuclear weapons were curtailed on Friday, though they could be reactivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
2.  **Erdogan's Mediation** Turkish President Erdogan announced his intent to meet with Putin soon to discuss peace prospects with Ukraine, followed by a visit or phone call to Zelensky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
3.  **Future Energy Strikes** If Russia abandons the idea of another massive strike on Ukraine's energy infrastructure, it will be a third indirect sign that the proposals are being taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The prevailing American position is a pragmatic approach: inflicting a military defeat on Russia on the battlefield using proxies, without seeking to change Russia's political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Ukraine, while successful militarily, cannot directly influence political change within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Any change must come from within Russia, by its own citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

It is anticipated that "turbo-patriots" and those critical of the authorities will be blamed and repressed in the immediate future, with censorship also tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. This is expected to be a temporary measure. Later, the military may also be blamed once a peace treaty is signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

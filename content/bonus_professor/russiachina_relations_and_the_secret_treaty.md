The 124th episode of "What is Happening," hosted by Valery Solovey, discussed the recent visit of a Russian delegation to Beijing, framing it within the context of [[russias_political_and_economic_relations_with_china | Russia's political and economic relations with China]] and a "secret treaty" between the two nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The program aired on Monday, May 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Context of the Visit: The "Chinese Bogdykhan" and "Moscow Prince" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>

The segment described the visit as a situation where the "real masters of Russia" sent a "double" (referring to the so-called President Putin, identified as Evgeny Vasilyevich) to Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The purpose, according to the speaker, was for this "Moscow prince" to "receive a label from the Chinese Bogdykhan to reign in Moscow," drawing historical parallels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Moscow's Objectives for the Visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>

The Kremlin pursued several goals during the visit:
*   **Legitimization of a Double**: The primary aim was to achieve [[legitimization_of_russian_leadership_in_china | China's acceptance of the double as president]], hoping this would lead to broader international recognition or at least prevent outright rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Pressure on China Regarding Swiss Summit**: Moscow sought to persuade China not to participate in the Swiss summit on [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Guarantees of Continued Military Support**: A critical objective was to secure assurances of ongoing [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics_and_potential_weapon_supply_issues | Chinese support for military operations against Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. The speaker emphasized that without [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics and_potential_weapon_supply_issues | China's provision of dual-use products]], Russian military actions would subside within months, and the economy would struggle to last beyond six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Resolution of Bank Payment Issues**: The Kremlin aimed to resolve problems with bank payments stuck in or returned by Chinese banks, which significantly hinder mutual trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Consent for Power of Siberia 2 Gas Pipeline**: Russia hoped to gain China's agreement for the construction of the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Beijing's Objectives for the Visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>

China's goals were primarily two-fold:
*   **Assess New Russian Leadership**: Beijing sought to observe the "new composition of the Russian leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Understand Readiness to Fulfill Secret Agreement**: More importantly, China wanted to ascertain Moscow's readiness to implement a "secret treaty" signed by the late Russian President Vladimir Putin with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in February 2022, on the eve of the Beijing Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## The Secret Treaty: An Act of "National Treason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>

This secret agreement, hidden from Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, grants China a 49-year lease of "gigantic territories" in Siberia and the Far East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This includes the right to develop natural resources and organize administration, effectively bringing these territories under Chinese control, leaving the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

The speaker characterized this treaty as the price the late President Putin was willing to pay for [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics | Chinese support]] for the "special military operation" in [[russia_ukraine_relations and_conflict | Ukraine]], which was intended as a quick victory but became a protracted conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The speaker emphatically stated that this agreement constitutes "an act of national treason" under Russian and international law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

The treaty is set to come into practical effect on January 1, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The Kremlin reportedly tried to postpone its implementation due to fear of a "monstrous scandal and domestic political crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. However, the Chinese have not yet decided whether to agree to a postponement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## China's Dominance and Russia's Humiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>

The power dynamic during the visit was heavily skewed, with China acting as a "master looking down on Moscow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The Chinese did not give a clear "yes" or "no" to the Russian side's "humiliated request" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

*   **Symbolic Agreements**: While some agreements were signed, they were "not very significant but very important from a symbolic point of view" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. One such agreement concerned cooperation on Bolshoy Usuriysky Island, which China considers entirely its own, despite its formal division with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The speaker noted that the Russian side does not protest China's depiction of the island as wholly Chinese on its maps, suggesting it's a "serious hint" of the Kremlin's readiness to proceed with the secret agreement despite the potential scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Humiliation of the Russian Delegation**: The visit was described as a "colossal, unprecedented humiliation" for the entire Russian delegation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Some members were reportedly denied basic necessities, such as access to toilets, forcing them to comply with the "Chinese masters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Nature of the "One-on-One" Meeting**: The so-called "one-on-one meeting" between the "double" and Xi Jinping was not a true private discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. No substantive issues were discussed; instead, it involved "praises of wisdom, strength and strong-willed dignity of the Chinese leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. The meeting included a translator and "people who controlled the double from the Russian side" to prevent him from saying anything inappropriate or foolish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Absence of Key Figures**: Two "real masters of the Russian land," Sergei Chemezov and Nikolai Patrushev, reportedly did not attend the Beijing visit, unwilling to be associated with the "humiliating requests and insults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   **Chinese Interest in Belousov**: The Chinese showed "noticeable interest" in Andrei Belousov, seeing him as a potential "new strong man of the Russian government" with whom to do business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

## Outcome of the Visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>

In summary, the Chinese did not agree to any important issues for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. There were no decisions on bank payments or the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. On [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Ukraine]], their stance remained "more than laconic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>, although China indicated willingness to send a delegation (not led by Xi Jinping) to the Swiss summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

The visit primarily resulted in "some very modest legitimization of the double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. The speaker concluded that the outcome was "frankly dangerous for Russia" because the "territorial integrity and national sovereignty of the Russian Federation have been called into question" due to the secret treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. The current Russian leadership, at least in part, appears ready to implement this "act of national treason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

The speaker announced a further discussion on the implications of these developments and future Russian politics on May 23, including potential changes in the Cabinet of Ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. These events are expected to "shake Russia" and also concern [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Russian-Ukrainian relations]] and confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

The implementation of [[impact_of_western_sanctions_on_russia | Western sanctions]] on Russia has had a significant [[economic_impacts_of_sanctions_on_russia | impact]], particularly on the Russian oligarchy and the broader economy, leading to potential [[economic_and_social_consequences_in_russia | economic and social consequences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Sanctions Against Oligarchs

Following the imposition of sanctions, prominent Russian oligarchs were notably affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The United States included major figures like Usmanov, Mordashov, Temchenko, Timchenko, Berg, Rotenberg, and Kovalchuk in its sanctions lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

A "differentiated approach" was observed in the application of sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>:
*   **"Seasoned" Oligarchs:** Figures like Timchenko, Rotenberg, and Kovalchuk faced a "merciless" approach from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Arkady Rotenberg, for instance, had assets confiscated and his real estate in Britain seized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **"Old School" Oligarchs:** Some oligarchs from the "old school," including those linked to the Yeltsin era, were given "some leeway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This was evident in Usmanov's case, where not all his companies or assets were immediately frozen by U.S. sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Abramovich, for example, was not formally included in initial sanctions and attempted to sell assets to avoid them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Some individuals, like those from the Alpha Group, were unable to resolve their travel restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

The freezing of assets and restrictions on travel to Europe or Great Britain significantly complicate personal and business situations for those sanctioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Abramovich's public statement about participating in negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv was viewed as an attempt to avoid sanction lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

It is suggested that the West is providing these oligarchs an opportunity to influence the situation regarding [[impact_of_putins_policies_on_russias_economy | Putin]] and the war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Broader Economic and Social Impacts

The sanctions are expected to lead to severe [[economic_challenges_in_russia | economic challenges]] and [[economic_and_social_consequences_in_russia | social consequences]] for the general population:
*   **Deficit and Shortages:** The current generation of Russians, who grew up under [[impact_of_putins_policies_on_russias_economy | Putin]], will learn what a "deficit" truly is, facing shortages of specific goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. While some basic goods might be available, specialized items will be scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Crisis:** A major concern is the provision of medicines, consumables for medical equipment like ultrasound and MRI machines, and overall medical care, which will become physically unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.
*   **Unemployment and Mobilization:** Mass unemployment is anticipated, potentially leading to the introduction of "labor service" or "labor armies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. Rumors of martial law are considered justified, as Russia is estimated to have used 90% of its selected forces in Ukraine, necessitating a reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.
*   **Inflation:** Despite banks raising deposit rates, high inflation is expected, making current offers appear foolish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. An annual inflation rate of 50-60% is projected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.
*   **Restriction on Movement:** A ban on leaving Russia is expected, particularly for conscripts and young, intelligent professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>. Reports suggest that FSB operatives are already present at airports, conducting interviews and checking phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>. Restrictions on taking out more than ten thousand dollars are also in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>. The introduction of "exit visas" requiring interviews is also considered possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>.
*   **Widespread Repression:** The government is expected to target not only disloyal leaders and bloggers but also mass groups of ordinary people to maintain "total loyalty" through intimidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>.

## State Perception and Future Outlook

The West views the current situation as an "economic war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>, which [[impact_of_putins_policies_on_russias_economy | Putin]] reportedly understands and is preparing to give an "asymmetric response" to, including putting nuclear forces on high alert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

Despite the mounting pressure, the effectiveness of sanctions in leading to a coup or elite conspiracy within Russia is doubted unless synchronized with a movement from below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. The disappearance of independent media and alternative viewpoints has limited internal mechanisms for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

Propaganda is still effectively working to maintain public support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>, and many people are unwilling to acknowledge or believe information that contradicts the official narrative, even regarding war casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. However, it is anticipated that the full [[impact of sanctions on Russia | impact of sanctions]] will be felt by the end of summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

The situation is expected to worsen for at least six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>, as the [[impact_of_sanctions_on_russia | impact of sanctions]] on the economy and daily life intensifies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

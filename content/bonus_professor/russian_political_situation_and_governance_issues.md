The [[political_situation_in_russia | Russian political climate]] and its governance are subjects of intense scrutiny, with experts highlighting issues ranging from leadership effectiveness to the populace's growing discontent.

## Leadership and Governance Critique
There is a perception among some groups that the current leadership is failing to effectively manage the country, particularly during times of crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Some believe that the "group that is next to him" hopes for a miraculous direction to a "quiet harbor" where their multi-billion dollar assets will be safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This perspective suggests a focus on personal wealth rather than the nation's well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

A prominent critique points to physiological reasons potentially impairing decision-making at the highest level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Additionally, the effectiveness of executive decisions is questioned due to a perceived lack of a "vertical of power" in [[russian_political_system_and_leadership | Russia]], leading to poor execution where "everything is executed to put it mildly neither shaky nor shaky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This suggests that only a small, "welded together by one chain and tied by common blood" group truly collaborates, as "they have nowhere to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

The authorities are described as only capable of "humiliate people and take from them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, rather than providing support or building effective systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Public Sentiment and Pandemic Response
Public opinion is divided regarding the official handling of the epidemic. Recent polls show:
*   **30%** believe authorities are hiding the true picture of the epidemic and underestimating data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **29%** believe the data provided is correct and reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **28%** think the threat from the virus is being used by authorities to cover up their "sins and affairs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

The approval of self-isolation has decreased by 10% in a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. Sociology reports used by the presidential administration indicate a "frightening" and "negative" public mood, making them hesitant to lift quarantine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. This negative sentiment suggests difficulties for future plebiscites or elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

There is a widespread lack of trust in official statements and initiatives, such as the promised low-interest mortgages. Experts and politicians express doubt that such proposals can be practically implemented, especially given the volatility of the national currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Economic and Social Challenges
The impact of the ongoing situation on the [[Russian Internal Politics and Economy | Russian Internal Politics and Economy]] is severe:
*   **Unemployment**: Expected to rise significantly, with estimates of half a million unemployed in Moscow alone, not including migrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>.
*   **Business Closures**: Many businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), are expected to close, with some believing a month of quarantine was a "fatal shot" to the economy and an extension a "control shot in the head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Financial Support**: Unlike other countries, Russia has not provided direct financial aid to its citizens, with 60-65% of Russian families reportedly lacking enough money to last a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Efforts to secure interest-free loans for businesses from banks have been met with refusal, indicating the state's inability to enforce its will on financial institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

The government's actions, such as the introduction of a pass system, have been criticized as poorly managed and ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. The police response, including fining citizens for minor infractions, is seen as cynical exploitation rather than assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

## Political Infighting and Future Outlook
Amidst the crisis, [[Russian political leadership transitions and internal power dynamics | political infighting]] and power struggles are observed. The Moscow Mayor, Sobyanin, has become "very strong," causing discontent among security forces and the Prime Minister's office, as they "naturally use this situation to strengthen their own positions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

Concerns are raised about potential political reforms, including a possible cancellation of gubernatorial elections starting in the fall and the removal of approximately 20 governors, some of whom may face imprisonment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. These discussions are largely based on information from channels like "not zygar," which are described as being sourced from the Russian president's press secretary and FSB officers, and are used for "manipulation" of public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>.

> "The decision has not been made yet well this is one of the options it is not to cancel them completely as it was remember after Beslan when the president simply canceled the gubernatorial elections and began to appoint governors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>

There is a growing sense of class hatred due to official rhetoric and the lack of support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. While society is not yet ready for mass protests, local conflicts and "deviant behavior" are expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.

Many believe that the ultimate agenda will be a demand for the "resignation of the president and government and the formation of the government national saved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. This outcome is expected to be achieved through street protests rather than elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>. The overall sentiment is that the current crisis is a "question of our physical existence" as a nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.

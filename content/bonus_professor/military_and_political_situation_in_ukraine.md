This article summarizes the military and political developments from the week of May 15, as presented by political analyst Valery Solovya. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>

## Military Situation

The Kremlin has been unable to achieve a turning point in the [[military_situation_in_ukraine_and_russias_challenges | special military operation]] in its favor, a fact evident to all uncommitted observers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> The chances of reaching a strategic turning point without the use of "extremely potent means" are diminishing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

Ukraine, conversely, feels a growing sense of drive and hope, believing it can achieve decisive success and fully regain all its territories, rather than merely restoring the pre-February 24th status quo. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has declared its readiness to mobilize up to a million people, preparing for a counteroffensive to fully return its territories. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>

In response, Russia is left with two primary instruments: mobilization and the use of qualitatively new, non-conventional weapons, specifically weapons of mass destruction. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> A "hidden mobilization" is reportedly underway in the Russian Federation, primarily drawing from the reserve created in 2015. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a> A public mass mobilization has not yet been announced and is likely to occur only after President Putin's recovery from an operation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>

When there is a lack of success on the fronts, Russia's Ministry of Defense (MoD) tends to release sensational news. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a> Recent examples include:
*   An announcement by the Chief of Radiation, Chemical, and Biological Protection troops, Harry Kirillov, about an alleged attempt to infect residents of the LPR (Luhansk People's Republic) with tuberculosis through fake bills. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a> This news drew a parallel to Soviet-era rumors of Americans poisoning chewing gum and cigarettes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
*   A report on the Pentagon's alleged experiments in a psychiatric hospital in the Kharkov region. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>
*   Earlier news, which has since faded, about Ukrainian secret laboratories developing dangerous disease strains and studying migratory bird routes to spread them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>

Such news items are seen as a way to occupy the information space in the absence of military successes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>

## Political Situation & Negotiations

The Kremlin faces a dilemma: either continue the operation without much chance of success or attempt to [[negotiations_and_political_landscape_in_kyiv | negotiate with Ukraine]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> To influence Ukraine into negotiations, Russia believes it must go through the West, and it is sending both overt and covert signals to Western nations regarding its desired conditions for a peace treaty. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

The Kremlin's current conditions for a peace treaty are described as almost minimal from its perspective, but not from Ukraine's or the West's. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> These conditions include:
*   Complete control of Donbass. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
*   Ukraine's recognition of Crimea as Russian. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   Donbass being independent or part of Russia in the future. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   A land corridor to Crimea. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>

Regarding the West's reaction:
*   An overt attempt at communication was a conversation between Russian Defense Minister Shoigu and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the first since February 18. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> This conversation was initiated at Russia's request, as Shoigu cannot conduct such talks on his own initiative. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
*   The overall response from the West is more negative than positive, though positions differ. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>
*   France and Germany would reportedly not mind if Russia and Ukraine agreed to such conditions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a> French President Macron reportedly offered Zelensky to make territorial concessions to Russia to achieve a peace treaty, which Zelensky refused. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a> Germany's position is less clear but manifests in delaying weapon supplies to Ukraine. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>
*   The "Saxon bloc" (Great Britain, the United States, Poland, and the Baltic countries) advocates for the war to continue to a victorious end for Ukraine. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>

The collective West desires a speedy conclusion to the conflict, but Russia, particularly the Kremlin and Putin, cannot afford to leave empty-handed, as this would be an admission of defeat. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> The word "capitulation" has now entered the lexicon of Russian officials, which was previously avoided, along with "defeat." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a> At the same time, the West has made it clear to Putin that it does not want an escalation or territorial expansion of the conflict, nor a qualitatively new level of confrontation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>

## Russian Domestic Situation

### Economic Optimism vs. Reality

Official rhetoric from the Russian leadership presents a positive economic outlook. President Putin stated that Russia is successfully overcoming sanctions, which are to its advantage, and that the ruble is demonstrating the best dynamics among all world currencies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a> He also claimed that the West is experiencing problems with unemployment, inflation, and falling GDP. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a> This "injection of optimism" is compared to Soviet-era propaganda under Leonid Brezhnev. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>

However, the reality behind this optimism appears different:
*   Bloomberg reports that the Ministry of Finance forecasts a GDP decline of 12% in Russia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a> Under a pessimistic scenario, if Russia's isolation from world markets and oil sales continues, the decline could be up to 25% over two years, an unprecedented drop. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a> Even the predicted decline would be the largest in 94 years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>
*   All economic achievements and growth from the past 10 years are effectively being wiped out. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>
*   Despite the strong ruble, personal incomes are decreasing and prices are rising. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>
*   Car sales in the Russian Federation collapsed by almost 80% in April, indicating a significant drop in societal well-being. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>
*   AvtoVAZ is reportedly preparing to offer car models from the early 1990s due to a lack of imported components, especially automotive electronics. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>
*   Unemployment is a growing threat, with one-fifth of companies initiating mass layoffs and another third considering it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>

### Societal Mood and Patriotism

The speaker suggests that the use of jokes and anecdotes is necessary to "smooth over" a reality that is "absolutely unbearable." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a> He notes a visible increase in the number of unbalanced people or moments in behavior. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>

To compensate for the deteriorating social situation, declining incomes, and lack of economic prospects, the government is resorting to "injections of optimism" and, primarily, "injections of patriotism." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a> Measures include:
*   Introducing history lessons from the first grade, which are expected to become political information sessions akin to those in the Soviet era. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>
*   Restoring the All-Union Pioneer Organization on May 19. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>

The speaker criticizes this approach, stating that the government is "trying to go forward with its head turned back," looking to the past for future examples. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a> He concludes that the more talk there is about patriotism and calls for patience, the worse the real state of affairs in the country is, leading to lower incomes and worse prospects. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a> This type of "state-owned" patriotism, which tells people to live worse because it is their fate, causes rejection. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>

### Governor Resignations

Five governors were removed from their positions last week. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a> They are considered "lucky" because they will not be held accountable, as the position of governor has become a "frankly shot" one. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a> High-ranking officials in Russia only resign by order of the supreme leadership. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a> More removals are expected, with some potentially facing criminal cases. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>

The speaker concludes by calling the past week "phantasmagoric" and encourages listeners to help each other, support human dignity, common sense, and moral values in Russia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a> He expresses firm belief that "victory will be ours." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The ongoing conflict brings colossal and incalculable losses to the involved countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. There is a hope that by the end of 2023, the parties may enter into [[prospects_of_a_truce_and_peace_negotiations_in_russian_military_conflicts | peace negotiations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Prospects for Negotiations
A preliminary agreement between the warring parties to engage in negotiations already exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. It is anticipated that these [[consultations_and_proposals_for_resolving_the_ukraine_conflict | negotiations]] will most likely be completed by the fall, or at least by the end of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. However, there is no current agreement on a specific peace formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

The speaker notes that the current situation is leaning towards a stalemate, characterized as a positional war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. While the outcome of the military confrontation is not yet a foregone conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, things are moving towards the beginning of [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace negotiations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

### Challenges and Conditions
Both the Russian and Ukrainian sides currently hope to achieve a decisive advantage on the battlefield before entering negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. The Russian side, in particular, may use mobilization as a means to achieve this, even potentially for a counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Mobilization serves as a demonstration of a country's readiness to continue and increase military efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

There is a high probability of negotiations in the fall, especially if a counteroffensive fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. It is asserted that negotiations will involve Russia and its leadership, but not specifically Putin, as he will no longer be able to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

According to polls, the Ukrainian people are currently unwilling to agree to a "peace in exchange for territory" formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. However, it is suggested that if the Ukrainian people are deprived of Western military support, they would immediately enter [[discussion_on_russian__ukrainian_relations_and_conflict_resolution | negotiations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, as "necessity breaks any ambitions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes the saying, "a bad peace is better than a good quarrel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. As of now, no realistic alternative to a truce or peace is apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

### Post-Conflict Governance
The outcome of the conflict and future governance in Russia depend on who replaces the current leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. New leaders could either continue military confrontation or immediately announce a unilateral ceasefire and offer unconditional [[prospects_of_peace_and_territorial_disputes_in_russia | peace talks]] on neutral territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

Regarding military structure after the conflict, the experience of the Russian-Ukrainian confrontation suggests a transition to a fully professional contract army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

### Other Political Considerations
*   **Patrushev's Group**: The positions of Patrushev's group are reportedly weakening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. While they aimed to strengthen control, potentially through elements like the digital ruble, physical slavery was never part of their plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Elections**: Current elections are deemed "derogatory" and offensive to common sense, making participation questionable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Political Candidates**: The speaker's team has multiple worthy candidates for presidential roles, with good chances of recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Amnesty**: A broad amnesty for political and "near-political" articles, along with rehabilitation for innocently convicted individuals, is planned after a regime change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Law Enforcement Reform**: A gradual change in the law enforcement system is envisioned, where those at the top dictate new behavior patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. A special service will be created to restore citizens' constitutional rights violated over the past 20-30 years, and it will recommend punishments for those who violated these rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Circumstances are dynamic and can change frequently, especially on a national scale or within supreme authority, requiring consideration of both internal and [[international_relations_and_cooperation | international contexts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

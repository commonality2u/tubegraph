The current global transition, which began in the 1990s with the collapse of the Soviet model of socialism, is moving away from a clearly ordered world towards an unknown future [00:00:28]. While the exact nature of this new world is uncertain, individuals possess the will and desire to influence its formation [00:01:46].

## The Financial Elite and Influence
The [[world_financial_elite_influence | financial elite]] remains a dominant group, primarily focused on maintaining its status quo through a degree of closure rather than expansion [00:10:51]. This tendency is particularly noticeable within Anglo-Saxon societies, and to a lesser extent, European ones [00:11:17].

## Non-Public Organizations
In addition to the financial elite, there are various [[influence_of_nonpublic_organizations_on_global_politics | non-public organizations]], sometimes erroneously referred to as secret societies, that wield significant influence globally [00:11:25]. There are about a dozen and a half such influential organizations where elite groups are represented [00:11:38].

These organizations are not world governments [00:12:35]. Instead, they are influential enough to maintain their autonomy and sovereignty [00:12:26]. Their primary goals often extend beyond wealth acquisition, focusing on understanding and transforming human nature [00:12:40]. Many of these organizations are long-standing [00:12:59].

### Exclusion of Russian Elites
The "cream of Western society" are members of these organizations, but the "cream" of Russian society is generally not accepted [00:13:34]. This exclusion irritates Russian elites who desire to join these exclusive clubs [00:14:13]. The reasons for this exclusion include:
*   **Lack of consistent identity:** Russian elites are perceived as opportunistic, shifting political allegiances from communists to "pure Denikin and Kolchak" [00:14:26].
*   **Lack of perceived value:** Western organizations question what Russian elites can offer them [00:14:45].
*   **Absence of historical responsibility:** Members of these influential organizations typically possess a strong sense of historical responsibility for their nation and its mission, a quality often lacking in their potential Russian counterparts [00:14:59].
*   **Perception of corruption:** Foreign counterparts view many Russian elites as "thieves" and are unwilling to engage in dialogue with them [00:15:15]. While ethnicity can influence trust, the primary concern is the integrity and mission of the individual [00:16:36].
*   **Disdain for security services:** Security officers from Russia are generally distrusted and deeply despised, which hinders professional activities of Russian special services [00:17:14].

Russian elites, despite their vast wealth, appear to lack a deeper aspiration beyond money and power [00:18:08]. While some may wish to "leave a good memory" or "leave a mark in history," their fear of the authorities prevents them from pursuing alternative projects [00:18:41]. This fear is rooted in the constant surveillance by departments like the FSB's special department, created in 2012, which monitors the financial elite for any actions perceived as disloyal to the presidential administration [00:20:04].

### Role in Geopolitical Shifts
Non-public organizations generally operate through individuals and institutions [00:45:28]. These organizations have entered into conflict with the Kremlin elite, a situation that intensified around 2017 [00:44:53]. They are capable of exerting external pressure, including economic sanctions [00:48:09].

However, they support the principle of free will and acknowledge the limitations of manipulative mechanisms [00:47:07]. They believe that the fate of a country is ultimately decided by its people [00:47:02]. These organizations aim to maintain a balance or "world harmony," believing that the Kremlin, among others, has disrupted this balance [00:49:12]. A world government, however, does not exist, primarily due to the inherent impossibility of organizing such a body and the existence of free will, especially the free will of the people, which can fundamentally alter situations [00:49:37].

A significant portion of the Russian population, including official figures, believes in the existence of a world government [00:50:49]. This belief stems from a deep-seated insecurity within the Russian authorities regarding their own legitimacy, leading them to seek out perceived "real rulers of this world" [00:51:30]. This self-doubt also manifests in their frequent reliance on repression and a brutal tone, as they attempt to project an image of strength they do not truly possess [00:52:17].

Russian authorities fear change and a loss of control, including the potential for their foreign assets to be seized [00:52:48]. This fear has led some Russian elites to transfer their assets into physical forms (e.g., tons of dollars or gold in bank cells or real storage facilities), often in hard-to-reach locations like Africa or Latin America, reflecting a desire for tangible security and control [00:54:14].

## Preparation for a Decisive Battle
Both parties in the conflict are preparing for a decisive battle and concentrating their forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Ukraine's Strategic Offensive
According to President Biden, Ukraine expects to receive substantial [[military_aid_and_strategy_in_the_ukrainian_conflict | military aid]] from NATO countries and allies in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This aid includes:
*   2,000 tanks and other armored vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>
*   More than 800 artillery systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   More than 2 million shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>
*   More than 9 multiple launch rocket systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>

Ukraine requires this equipment to launch a [[strategic_turning_point_in_ukraine_conflict | strategic offensive]], distinct from a counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The objective of this [[strategic_turning_point_in_ukraine_conflict | strategic offensive]] is to reach the state borders of Ukraine with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Russian Counter-Strategy
In response to Ukraine's preparations, the Russian Federation is attacking Ukraine's energy system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The aim is to:
*   De-energize Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>
*   Cause disorganization in industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>
*   Demoralize Ukrainian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>
*   Exert public pressure on President Zelensky and the Ukrainian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>
*   Provoke a new significant wave of emigration towards European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>

Russia also anticipates receiving new weapons systems, particularly ballistic missiles, from Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The first batch of these missiles is expected to be transferred before the New Year and utilized thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

Another key aspect of [[putins_strategy_for_ukraine | Russia's strategy]] is a new mobilization and concentration of manpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The Kremlin believes that a quantitative advantage is essential to achieve victory or even honorable peace terms with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This approach mirrors [[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_strategy | Russian military strategy]] from the mid-20th century, which relied on manpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

## Putin's PR Response to Zelensky's Success
President Zelensky is perceived to "completely outplay" the Russian leader in terms of public relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This forces Putin to react with similar PR events, such as alleged visits to headquarters, awarding fighters, and meeting with the Belarusian President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The initiative in the foreign policy arena, where reputation and image are formed, currently rests with the Ukrainian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

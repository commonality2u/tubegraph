Russian national identity is often expressed through cultural references, historical narratives, and a focus on resilience and self-reliance.

## Cultural Characteristics and Traits

Cultural references suggest a unique Russian character. One speaker notes that a Russian person can "drink with shaking hands," referencing a performance by People's Artist Lebedev at the Leningrad BDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Another common joke cited is "Stop drinking and get on his skis," implying a call to action or a particular approach to overcoming challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Patriotic Sentiment

Expressions of national pride frequently invoke the vastness and shared history of Russia. A patriotic song highlights "our beloved country," describing it as a "free fraternal peoples Union" stretching "from the southern thieves to the Polar region," with "our forests and fields are spread out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The lyrics also call for wisdom to be "glorified" for "our fatherland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Emphasis on Practical Skills and Labor

A strong sense of pride is associated with practical skills and the ability to work with one's own hands. One speaker proudly states they are a "fourth-category carpenter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, a qualification earned while working in a student detachment in the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This qualification was necessary to receive payment for work performed, such as major repairs of small houses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. The speaker recalls discussing this with a former US President, who was initially skeptical but reacted strongly upon seeing proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This background also connects to large-scale national projects, as student detachments were involved in the construction of facilities like the Vostochny Cosmodrome and Olympic venues in Sochi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

## New Year's Addresses and National Unity

New Year's addresses often serve as a platform to reinforce national identity, unity, and resilience. Themes include:
*   **Reflection and Progress**: Acknowledging hard work, common achievements, and being firm in defending national interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Resilience in Challenges**: Recognizing "colossal challenges" and the ability to "live in such harsh conditions" and "solve complex problems" thanks to national solidarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Shared Responsibility**: Emphasizing "large-scale goals that society faces" and the "colossal responsibility for the Motherland that Each of us feels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Hopes for the Future**: Expressing wishes for "joyful events," the formation of new families, and children growing up "healthy, smart, honest and free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. The family is highlighted as a core unit where "attention, warmth and care for parents reign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

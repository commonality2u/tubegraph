The visit of [[xi_jinpings_visit_to_moscow | Xi Jinping to Moscow]] was a significant topic of discussion, with many questions dedicated to evaluating its outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The overall assessment suggests that the visit was successful and useful for China, but unsuccessful and not useful for the Russian Federation, and particularly disappointing for President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Benefits for China

China gained several significant advantages from the visit:
*   **Economic Concessions**
    *   Access to cheap gas with a substantial discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
    *   Commitment from Russia to build a new liquefied natural gas pipeline at Russia's expense, which will supply gas at a colossal discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   Russia's commitments to all investment projects and economic requests that China is interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Financial Influence**
    *   Russia has effectively reviewed its trade currency, agreeing to pay in yuan for trade with Latin America and Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This move is exclusively beneficial to China, as it expands the global appeal of the yuan and further ties the Russian Federation to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Disappointments for Russia

In return for its concessions, the Russian Federation primarily received "beautiful, high-flown, flowery oriental formulas" about being reliable partners who together resist attempts to undermine modern peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Lack of Military Support
President Putin was particularly disappointed that the Chinese did not promise to supply Russia with lethal military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. While China already supplies non-lethal goods for the armed forces and will continue to do so, Russia is in dire need of military equipment to repel the anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive in the spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

China responded to these requests with "friendly reprimands," affectionately patting President Putin on the shoulder or cheek, a gesture indicative of a dominant party's confidence over another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The Chinese vaguely indicated they might revisit the issue of lethal weapons in the summer, intending to observe the results of the Ukrainian counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This caution is driven by a desire to avoid worsening relations with the United States if supplying arms proves ineffective for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The Chinese comrades are in no hurry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Shifting Geopolitical Standing
The visit highlights a shift in Russia's geopolitical standing. Russia, which once spoke of multipolarity, is now effectively becoming a vassal of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This is seen as an ongoing process that is far from complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Impact on Russian Domestic Politics

[[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics | China's influence on Russian politics]] and its geopolitical stance suggests that the Chinese are indifferent to who holds the presidency in Russia (Putin, Dmitry Patrushev, or Mishustin), so long as Russia fulfills its obligations to China and maintains political stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

The meeting also served as a "bride show" for Prime Minister Mishustin, whom [[xi_jinpings_visit_to_moscow | Xi Jinping]] reportedly observed closely and seemed pleased with, extending an invitation for Mishustin to visit China alongside the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This suggests a potential consideration by China for future [[potential_changes_in_russian_leadership_and_implications | Russian leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

An earlier error by [[xi_jinpings_visit_to_moscow | Xi Jinping]] was noted from February of the previous year, when he consented to Vladimir Putin's assurance of a "lightning-fast" and "large-scale" military operation that would lead to triumphant success for Russia in a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Russian Far East Territories

Regarding the [[russiachina_relations_and_influence | Russian Far East]], an agreement was signed last year, set to take effect in 2025, which grants China a 49-year lease on "gigantic territories" comparable in area to Ukraine in the Far East and Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. However, it is believed that this "anti-national" agreement will not be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

## Putin's Personal Upset

President Putin was significantly upset that he could not participate in a traditional ritual with elders on the vernal equinox due to [[xi_jinpings_visit_to_moscow | Xi Jinping's visit]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>.

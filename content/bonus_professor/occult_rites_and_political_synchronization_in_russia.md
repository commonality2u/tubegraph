## The Rite of Thirty-Three Misfortunes

The material in question concerns "the rite of thirty-three misfortunes" from a grimoire titled "The Cup of the Blind King" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. This information is considered "extremely fascinating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

It reportedly demonstrates how certain [[Occultism and magical practices in Russia | occult rites]], conducted in the two months prior to the broadcast, "synchronize[d] with the dates of the political... history of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This specific topic is planned to be detailed in a lecture on February 25, available both in Moscow and online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

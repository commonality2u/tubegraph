Valery Solovey's 124th episode of "What is Happening," broadcast on Monday, May 20, focused on the death of Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## The "Iranian Butcher"

Ibrahim Raisi, known by the nickname "the Iranian Butcher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[01:01]</a>, died in what is considered an air crash on Sunday, May 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[01:09]</a>. He earned this nickname due to his role in the judiciary, initially in the Iranian capital and then overseeing the entire national judicial power, especially given the "overly humane Iranian judicial system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[01:51]</a>.

## Circumstances of Death

As of the broadcast, there is a lot of speculation and assumptions regarding the cause of his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[01:19]</a>. However, the current circumstances suggest the disaster was more natural than man-made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[01:24]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> The speaker advises against engaging in empty speculation regarding Raisi's death due to a lack of reliable information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[03:00]</a>. The only unconditional fact is that "the Iranian butcher is no longer alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[03:07]</a>.

## Potential Impacts

Two main questions arise concerning Raisi's death:
1.  How it will affect Russian-Israeli relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[02:09]</a>. The speaker notes that some people are interested in close relations with the Russian Federation for mercantile and pragmatic reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[02:34]</a>.
2.  How it will affect the internal situation in Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[02:45]</a>. The speaker admits uncertainty on this matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[02:50]</a>.

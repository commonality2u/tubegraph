Valery Solovey's program, "What Is Happening," discussed the main topic of the "death of the Iranian butcher" in its 124th episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Identity and Death

The "Tehran Butcher" or "Iranian Butcher" is a nickname for the President of Iran, Ibrahim Raisi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Raisi reportedly died in a plane crash, or what is considered an air crash, on Sunday, May 19, the day of the Soviet Pioneer movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

At the time of the broadcast, while there were many insinuations and assumptions about the cause of his death, the circumstances so far suggested that the nature of the disaster was more natural than man-made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Origin of the "Butcher" Nickname

Ibrahim Raisi earned the "disrespectful" nickname "Iranian Butcher" due to his role in the judiciary, first in the Iranian capital and then across the entire national judicial power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This was attributed to his "special" (in quotes) actions within Iran's "overly humane" judicial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Potential Consequences

The death of President Raisi raised questions about its potential impact on several fronts:

*   **Russian-Israeli Relations**: It is speculated how his death will affect Russian-Israeli relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. There are individuals interested in close relations with the Russian Federation for pragmatic, often mercantile, reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Internal Situation in Iran**: Another question is how Raisi's death will affect the internal situation within Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

>[!WARNING] Limited Information
>It is noted that there is too little information, especially reliable information, to engage in "empty speculation" regarding the consequences of Raisi's death, other than the "unconditional fact" that "the Iranian butcher is no longer alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Valery Solovey, a professional historian and guest on the program, offers a critical [[valery_solovievs_political_analysis | political analysis]] of Vladimir Putin's presidency, asserting that Putin's era has already ended and will ultimately be viewed negatively by history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. He discusses the missed opportunities, the transformation of Putin's personality, and the potential future political dynamics of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

## An Era of Missed Opportunities

Solovey argues that no Russian politician in history had more favorable conditions than Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. These conditions included high oil prices, no external enemies, benevolent Western relations, and access to loans and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Society and nearly all elite groups welcomed Putin after Yeltsin, granting him a huge credit of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Early Prosperity
> In the first eight years of Putin's presidency, Russia experienced significant economic growth, and people's incomes increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. This led to a taste of Western-like prosperity, with people changing iPhones, traveling to foreign resorts beyond Turkey (like France and Spain), and acquiring homes through mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. This period, from the people's perspective, made them perceive Putin's actions positively, as they aligned with their national interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

However, Solovey believes that had Putin stepped down in 2008, he would have been remembered as the greatest statesman who lifted Russia from its knees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. Instead, the perception began to change around 2011, notably after the "castling" of power with Dmitry Medvedev, which people saw as a deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

### Deteriorating Conditions and Public Discontent
A significant factor in the declining public perception is the continuous decrease in people's incomes for six years in a row <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>, which causes "colossal irritation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. The government's inability to cope with the crisis for such a long period is unprecedented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. The pension reform, in particular, is seen as a "mockery of common sense," as many men in Russia do not live to the new retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Crimea's Short-Lived Impact
> While the annexation of Crimea led to a "colossal rise in popularity" for Putin, it merely paused the declining rating, which has now returned to 2011 levels, but with a significant negative public experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

Solovey concludes that Putin will be remembered as a leader who "missed a unique historical chance to ensure the rapid development of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. This opportunity was exchanged for the enrichment of his friends and "cheap, incomprehensible projects" like the most expensive Olympic Games in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

## Putin's Personality and the Information Cocoon

According to Solovey, Putin's conviction that everything he did was "absolutely right" and "impossible to act differently" is a clear indicator of "deformation of the personality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. This deformation is attributed to prolonged time at the top of power (nearly 20 years), lack of competition, absence of public criticism, and being surrounded by sycophants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.

> "A normal person gets infected... around him create an information cocoon, around him created a kind of sterile information space in which it is located, and in this space everything is fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.

Putin's current perception of reality includes a "messianic complex," believing he is an "outstanding statesman" and "the largest world leader of the early 21st century" who "raised Russia from its knees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>. Solovey suggests Putin is "simply afraid" of the truth that would destroy his fabricated world view, leading him to fear people and increasingly surround himself with security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.

### The Elite's Corruption and Disconnect
The elite surrounding Putin is described as corrupted by "colossal money" and privileges gained through their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:00">[21:12:00]</a>. Many of these individuals, who were "walking around St. Petersburg in sports Turkish trousers" 15-18 years ago, now imagine themselves "masters of the world" and the "new aristocracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:27:00">[21:27:00]</a>. They treat ordinary people "like serfs, like lower-class creatures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>. This disconnect leads the government to "spoil relations with all groups of society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:29:00">[33:29:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The Insult to the People
> The government's actions, such as laying tiles in Moscow while people in other regions live in monstrous conditions, are seen as an "insult to our people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:00">[32:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:42:00">[32:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. Solovey asserts that a tenth of the money Russia received from raw material sales could have provided everyone with normal housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>.

## The Future of Power Transit in Russia

Solovey believes the [[russian_political_dynamics_amidst_leadership_changes | transit of power]] will be "very risky" and "will not go at all as planned in the Kremlin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:00]</a>. The situation is "too unstable" and "turbulent" due to immense and growing discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13:00">[25:13:00]</a>. There are "too many problems in the country" with "no solutions," and crucially, "no one is looking for solutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:28:00">[25:28:00]</a>. This indicates the "inefficiency of the state system as a whole" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:00">[25:38:00]</a>.

### Contradictions and Potential Forces
Solovey states that a "second Putin" will "definitely not be" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:12:00">[27:12:00]</a>. The unique conditions that brought Putin to power in 1999-2000, where he "optimally corresponded to the needs of society," no longer exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:00">[26:56:00]</a>. The accumulated contradictions are too sharp for a smooth transition, unlike in Kazakhstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:44:00">[26:44:00]</a>.

He predicts that the transition will only occur as a result of "pressure from below," specifically "strong grassroots pressure" in the form of "mass protests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:55:00">[27:55:00]</a>. Symptoms of this pressure are already visible, citing the authorities' retreats in Yekaterinburg and Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:27:00">[28:27:00]</a>.

#### Liberal vs. Leftist Chances
Solovey believes that liberals have the greatest chances to gain power, not due to popularity, but because they "control the entire forest of information," media, and hold key positions in ministries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:00">[36:02:00]</a>. They also possess "some developed ideas and plans" for economic transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:18:00">[36:18:00]</a>. Their rhetoric will need to be social, focusing on "justice and equality before the law" and "respect for human dignity" to gain broad support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:46:00">[36:46:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Russian Individualism
> Solovey argues that "Russia is not strong left island," but rather "strong moods" of people wanting "to take revenge on the masters of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:43:00">[37:43:00]</a>. Russian society is "very individualistic," with no trace of the "notorious community or commune" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:01:00">[38:01:00]</a>. This individualism favors liberals, as people "do not want to have anything to do with the state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:21:00">[38:21:00]</a>. He does not believe in the chances of radical left groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:48:00">[38:48:00]</a>.

### Necessary Reforms for the Future
To avoid societal upheaval, Solovey suggests two urgent reforms:
1.  **Freedom for small and medium businesses:** This can be achieved quickly by removing existing restrictions and canceling unhelpful laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:50:00">[49:50:00]</a>.
2.  **Complete reform of the judicial and legal system:** As there is "actually no court" in Russia, justice is absent. This would require a "total illustration" of the judicial corps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:03:00">[50:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:03:00">[51:03:00]</a>.

Other reforms, like healthcare and education, would take much longer (10-15 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:16:00">[50:16:00]</a>. He also proposes a temporary ban on officials and their families leaving Russia while an "inventory and lustration" is conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:35:00">[50:35:00]</a>.

Solovey emphasizes the importance of a peaceful transition, as he senses a "civil war" in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:34:00">[51:34:00]</a>. He hopes the new leadership will prioritize the "care of this common people" and the "education of a new person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:01:00">[52:01:00]</a>, understanding that "the state should serve society and not society serve the state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:17:00">[52:17:00]</a>.

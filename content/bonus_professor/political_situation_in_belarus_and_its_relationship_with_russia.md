The political landscape in Belarus following the presidential elections in August 2020 has been marked by significant unrest and protests, which have been described as a revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. These elections were not recognized by many European countries, including Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Despite the widespread protests, the impulse of Belarusians has not been sufficient to decisively overthrow President Lukashenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Russia's Influence and Proposed Compromise

Amidst the protests, a high degree of uncertainty remains regarding the future unfolding of events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. A likely compromise formula has reportedly been discussed between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Proposed Compromise Details
The formula for this compromise reportedly includes:
*   Lukashenko remaining President of Belarus for no more than one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Announcing early presidential elections after a new constitution is adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   During this period, Lukashenko must sign a new union treaty with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Lukashenko would not stand for re-election in the early presidential elections, with Babariko being a favored candidate by Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   Belarus would gain a new, non-authoritarian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   Russia would gain increased control over Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   Lukashenko would relocate to Moscow and become secretary of the new State Council in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

This proposed plan aims to force the Belarusian opposition and society into negotiating a compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Russian Reserves and Military Involvement
Putin's statement about Russia preparing reserves to assist Lukashenko was intended to pressure the Belarusian opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. However, the use of force is not a valid argument as neither Putin nor Lukashenko desire it, recognizing it would severely damage relations between Russians and Belarusians, similar to the impact on relations between Russians and Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Angela Merkel was informed by Putin that Russia does not intend to introduce armed forces into Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. The "reserve" referred to by Putin is not the army itself, but rather the so-called "force of the Rosgvardiya" (Russian National Guard) and OMON (Special Purpose Mobile Unit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. As of the interview, there were approximately 200-300 Rosgvardiya personnel, primarily former Ukrainian Berkut fighters, in Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## External Factors and International Relations
Lukashenko has claimed an external factor influences the rallies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. While an external factor exists, it is not of primary importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. There is a group of American consultants, specialists in political technologies based in Warsaw, attempting to assist the opposition, but their role is not decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. It is asserted that the Belarusian revolution is not provoked from the outside, similar to how the Revolution of Dignity was not solely provoked by Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The European Union, in fact, sought compromise with Yanukovych in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. If any external entity has a key impact on the dynamics of events in Belarus, it is the [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus|Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## [[future_of_belarus_under_lukashenko|Future of Belarus Under Lukashenko]] and Independence
If Lukashenko were to sign the union treaty being discussed, Belarus would effectively become a Western province of the [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus|Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Belarus would lose 95% of its national powers to the union state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

Lukashenko himself states he will never voluntarily leave his position, believing he was elected by his people and can only be removed by being killed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. If he becomes an insurmountable obstacle to Russian control over Belarus, troubles could befall him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. It is suggested that Lukashenko may be overestimating his ability to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Donbass Negotiations and [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus|Russian Sociopolitical Dynamics]]
Minsk has served as the main negotiating platform for Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. As of the interview, there was no talk of changing this platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The Russian delegation might be strengthened with Vladislav Surkov returning to the Ukrainian direction of [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus|Russian policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. In extreme cases, negotiations could be transferred to Almaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

The potential return of Surkov is linked to the need to intensify the deadlocked negotiating process, despite previous dissatisfaction from Putin regarding Surkov's handling of agreements with the Ukrainian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Future of Russia-Ukraine-Belarus Relations
The determining factor in the future relations between Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus will be a "very powerful and radical political crisis" within the [[russian_internal_political_dynamics|Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This crisis is expected to change the mode of relations between Russia and its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. It is anticipated that Russia will be too preoccupied with internal problems to focus on these countries, and Putin will leave office, leading to new leadership, a new agenda, and a new style of relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

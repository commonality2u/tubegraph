This article discusses recent alleged and actual [[allegations_of_political_murder | assassination attempts]] on prominent political figures, specifically Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin, drawing insights from a program by Valery Solovey.

## Attempt on Donald Trump

On July 13, at the time of a rally in Pennsylvania, an attempt was made on the life of US presidential candidate Donald Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The speaker refrained from speculating on who was behind the attempt, whether it was a lone wolf, an organization, or a "hit conceived by a game of the Soviet KGB" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. At the moment, no information is available to make definitive judgments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Trump was reportedly saved "literally by a miracle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It is believed that this [[allegations_of_political_murder | assassination attempt]] will likely play a decisive role in his ascent to the presidential chair, making his chances of losing the election seem small, while the chances of him becoming the new president are seen as prevailing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Claims Regarding Vladimir Putin

The head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Budanov (declared an extremist terrorist in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>), stated that Ukrainian intelligence made several unsuccessful attempts to assassinate [[Rumors of Vladimir Putins death and its implications | President Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. However, the speaker clarified this statement, referring to [[Rumors of Vladimir Putins death and its implications | President Putin]] as "the late President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Pre-February 2022 Attempts

Prior to February 24, 2022, none of the alleged attempts to assassinate [[Rumors of Vladimir Putins death and its implications | President Putin]] reached the stage of organizational preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. These discussions remained "at the level of conversations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. At least until February 2022, [[Rumors of Vladimir Putins death and its implications | President Putin]] was considered "one of the most protected, maybe even the most protected person in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Post-February 2022 Changes

After February 2022, the idea of making an [[assassination_attempt_on_president_putin | assassination attempt]] on the Russian president naturally arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Similarly, the Russian military-political leadership considered assassinating the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, expecting him to leave Ukraine or move to western Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. A "hunt" for Zelensky began, which was unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Later, several missiles were fired at locations where Zelensky was present, which occurred this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This was connected to the discovery of "moles of Russian intelligence in Zelensky's inner circle," leading to a purge in the State Security Service in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Zelensky's security was highly professional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

The speaker expresses doubt that any [[assassination_attempt_on_president_putin | assassination attempt]] on the "late Putin" after February 2022 reached an organizational stage due to the first-class security measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The person who replaced the "late Putin" is reportedly guarded with the same high level of security, as their importance is considered very great to prevent the collapse of the Russian government structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

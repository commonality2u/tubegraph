The Kremlin's approach to [[peace_negotiations_with_ukraine | peace negotiations]] involves specific strategic goals and a distinct interpretation of what a "peace agreement" entails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Kremlin's Diplomatic Strategy

Moscow, or the [[kremlins_policies_and_international_relations | Kremlin]], is actively attempting to divide "old Europe" (Germany, France, Italy) from "new Europe" (led by Poland) and from the Anglo-Saxon bloc (Great Britain and the United States) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This [[kremlins_diplomatic_strategies_with_ukraine_and_the_west | diplomatic strategy]] has achieved relative success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Moscow's Leverage in Europe
The Kremlin's influence stems from several factors:
*   **Incriminating Materials**: Moscow possesses compromising information on a number of European politicians, not necessarily first-line figures, but individuals who can influence decision-making and [[kremlins_foreign_policy_and_decisionmaking | foreign policy]] development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. A Bulgarian investigator, Christo Grozev, reportedly promised to publish a list of 600 European politicians who received support from the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Economic and Demographic Blackmail**: Moscow warns Europe that continued conflict will lead to an increased influx of Ukrainian refugees, straining budgets and social services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Additionally, Russia implies that ongoing policies could trigger a global famine, causing refugees from North Africa and the Middle East to migrate to Europe (specifically Italy, Germany, and France) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The memory of the 2015-2018 migration crisis is still a "splinter" in European governments' minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Henry Kissinger's Role
Henry Kissinger's statement advocating for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia is indicative of Moscow's efforts to activate its network of contacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. While his direct influence on global diplomacy is past its peak, Kissinger, a supporter of realpolitik focused on interests rather than values, aligns with the [[kremlins_foreign_policy_and_decisionmaking | Russian foreign policy]] mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## The Kremlin's Definition of "Peace"
A conversation between Putin, Scholz, and Macron revealed Putin's readiness for "peace," contingent on the lifting of sanctions in exchange for food supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. However, the [[kremlins_view_on_peace_with_ukraine | Kremlin's view on peace]] significantly differs from that of European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>:

> [!INFO] European vs. Kremlin's Peace Terms
> European countries (France, Germany) define a [[peace_negotiations_with_ukraine | peace agreement]] as Russia returning its troops to pre-February 24th positions, followed by a ceasefire and peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
>
> The Kremlin, however, interprets "peace" as a *truce* or ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This is seen as extremely beneficial for Moscow, providing time to regroup forces, bring in new contingents, and source military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The Kremlin is "categorically not interested" in returning troops to pre-operation positions and will not do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Strategic Implications of a Pause
If Ukraine were to take a step towards the Kremlin now, it would exclusively benefit the Kremlin by providing a respite, an opportunity for redeployment, and strengthening its positions in the territories it controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

These territories, which Russia calls "liberated" and the world calls "occupied," are being integrated into the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The Kremlin has decided to abandon the idea of self-proclaimed republics and instead aims to directly incorporate the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This means a change in territorial status that benefits the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. In these "new territories," Russian mobile operators and TV panels appear, prioritizing "spiritual food" (brainwashing) over restoring housing and material goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

Ukraine also needs a pause to receive promised weapons, especially multiple launch rocket systems, and to train personnel for a potential strategic counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. However, a strategic turning point for Ukraine is unlikely before the end of summer or early autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Resource Depletion and the Need for a Break
Russia needs a break because the issue of resource exhaustion is becoming very clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Evidence includes:
*   The abolition of the age limit for signing the first military contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   The un-mothballing of outdated T-62 tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   Allegations of forced round-ups of young men (18-27 years old) in Dagestan for military registration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

The military situation could change depending on which side runs out of resources faster, though both sides could face simultaneous exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## Impact of Leadership Changes on Foreign Policy
Russian history shows that the country's fate has always been very dependent on the ruler's destiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. A sudden change in leadership can lead to a shift in [[kremlins_foreign_policy_and_decisionmaking | foreign policy]], sometimes even ending wars or radically altering international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Examples include Peter III withdrawing Russia from the Seven Years' War in 1761 and Paul I leading Russia out of the anti-French coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. More recent examples include the deaths of Stalin and Brezhnev, which led to significant changes in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

Recent publications in Western media about the Russian president's grave health, even suggesting his death, are part of an information operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. While the president is alive but unwell, Western special services are leaking this information to influence the Russian elite and establishment (not the general public, who are kept unaware) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. The signal being sent is that "Putin is no longer the guarantor of the system" and his promises cannot be relied upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.

The Kremlin attempts to hide the president's true health condition using:
*   **Canned footage**: Pre-recorded video footage is released in portions over days or weeks to give the impression that the president is actively working and well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.
*   **Doubles**: The use of doubles is an almost strategic method, with one double allegedly used for a hospital visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Putin has reportedly used doubles for several years, such as for hockey games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

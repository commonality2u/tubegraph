From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Valery Solovey's "Answers to Hot Questions" program discussed the ongoing [[potential_political_transition_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | political transition]] in Russia, focusing on the proposed "transit scheme" and the implications of a double impersonating the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## The Transit Scheme and Power Dynamics

A preliminary agreement on a "transit scheme" was reached around the turn of November and December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This scheme involves significant [[political_changes_and_power_dynamics_in_postputin_russia | shifts in power]].

### Nikolai Patrushev's Role
Nikolai Patrushev is currently considered the de facto supreme ruler of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. His position is the result of a broad compromise and agreement among a wide coalition of several elite groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This agreement is temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The elite groups are observing how Patrushev conducts affairs and how his son, Dmitry, would operate if he becomes prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. They are not rushing to change the supreme power due to their extensive knowledge of Nikolai Patrushev, including his negative traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. It is expected that they will attempt to "replay" or renegotiate this agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Mishustin's Limited Power
Despite being a potential [[political_changes_in_russia_post_putin | interim head of state]] after the president's death, Mikhail Mishustin possesses virtually no significant power to initiate systemic political decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. He is not in a position to announce the president's death or call for early elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### The Double's Control
If the double is elected president, they will remain under complete and absolute control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. While the double's freedom might slightly increase, it is unlikely they could play an independent game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The entire entourage and main [[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | elite groups]] are aware of and anticipate this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Evidence of the Double
The speaker asserts that [[internal_political_developments_in_russia | clear signs of a political crisis]] will emerge within three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, providing evidence that the president of Russia is no longer alive and has been replaced by a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This evidence includes a diametrically opposite change in the president's behavior and appearance: he appears younger, livelier, cheerful, has stopped shaking hands, engages in hugs and kisses, and has become taller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. The double is both younger and taller than the deceased president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Furthermore, the voice has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This information has been published in major Western and non-Western respectable publications and key news sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The deceased president's body is reportedly still in a refrigerator in Valdai, awaiting transfer to better storage conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. The creation of such a similar double required long preparation and training, aided by a special earpiece to avoid major mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

## Consequences of Political Change

### Worsening Situation Post-Putin
The speaker warned that [[political_situation_in_Russia | Putin's death]] will not lead to liberation; instead, the situation will likely worsen, becoming more difficult than the COVID pandemic or the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. However, his death presents a chance that must be seized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### International Relations and Internal Stability
*   **Ukraine Conflict**: It is unlikely that the [[impact_of_political_changes_in_russia | international situation]], particularly relations between Russia and Ukraine, will improve before autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Even with internal [[political_changes_in_russia_post_putin | political changes]] beginning next year (potentially before March) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, it will take time for the crisis to fully manifest and influence events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.
*   **Western and Eastern Interests**: Other countries, including Western nations, Arab countries, Saudi Arabia, and China, prioritize their own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Their basic interest regarding Russia is the maintenance of stability, regardless of the regime that ensures it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. They are content with the current situation as it is "acceptable" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. They will not carry out Russia's struggle or bring ideals of freedom and democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   **Economic Outlook**: Inflation is highly likely to spiral out of control next year, indicating a stretched-out crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.
*   **Second Mobilization Wave**: A second wave of mobilization is currently unpredictable, as it depends on the dynamics of the general and domestic [[internal_political_developments_in_russia | political situation]] and the Russian-Ukrainian confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:25">[00:34:25]</a>. Russian troops are currently on the counterattack, primarily to demonstrate offensive potential and create a favorable background before the presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>, and to signal to the West that aid to Ukraine is futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.
*   **Martial Law**: The possibility of introducing martial law or its elements is still being discussed and remains an option if the country needs to be transformed into a military camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>.

## Future of Russia and Justice

### Leadership and Governance
The speaker believes that "anyone" can rule Russia better than a dead person, requiring only common sense and love for the people and country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. Building a new socialism in Russia is deemed unnecessary, as the old socialism ended poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

### Democratic Path and Checks and Balances
The speaker is confident that a return to dictatorship or a form of power similar to the current one will be practically impossible after a new path is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. Mechanisms of checks and balances, both institutional and extra-institutional, will be implemented to be extremely effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

### Accountability and Justice
*   **Officials**: All officials, including Shoigu and Gerasimov, who maliciously violated the law, betrayed the country and society, will be held accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
*   **Criminal Groups**: Criminal groups cannot resist armed force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. The idea that they are under the firm control of the current rulers is a "pernicious misconception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.
*   **Political Prisoners**: The speaker believes that the [[possibility_of_political_change_in_russia | changes that will happen in Russia]] will lead to the release of all political prisoners, including Alexei Navalny, Ilya Yashin, and Igor Strelkov (Girkin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>. Alexei Navalny is currently in transit to a maximum-security penal colony, alive and in a "more or less acceptable physical condition" given the circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **War Veterans**: Those who fought in Ukraine will likely face a similar fate to Soviet veterans of the Afghan War, potentially being disavowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.
*   **Financial Review**: Cases concerning foreign currency mortgages may be reviewed in a new Russia, among many other issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Information

The speaker noted that society is not yet ready for action, and demanding proof often serves as a justification for inaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. He works for the people of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a> and envisions a future where people live prosperously, not in poverty, lawlessness, or under moral and psychological repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>. The New Year will likely be congratulated by the double if no extraordinary events occur before then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. The suggested slogan for the opposition is "Putin is dead, all this is illegitimate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

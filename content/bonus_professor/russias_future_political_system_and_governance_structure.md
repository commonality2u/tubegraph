Valery Solovey discussed various aspects of Russia's [[future_of_russias_political_landscape | future political landscape]], including potential changes in governance, leadership, and key reforms.

## Prospects of Political Change
The current political system is seen as facing a process of "delegitimization of power," where trust in authorities is diminishing. This lack of trust is considered the initial step toward dismantling the current power structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The elite is reportedly aware of Putin's extensive use of doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, and the next step is believed to be the delegitimization of power in the eyes of Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

While some within the Patrushev group elite are hesitant to seize power due to mutual fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>, the actions of figures like Prigozhin have "expanded the framework," demonstrating new opportunities for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. Solovey anticipates decisive movements in the [[russian_political_landscape_and_potential_changes | Russian political landscape]] by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

## Governance Structure Post-Putin
Regarding the form of government after the current regime, Russia will likely transition to a "new Russian Republic" established by a new constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This constitution will include transitional provisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. It is deemed impossible to immediately transition Russia to a parliamentary republic due to the absence of a fully-fledged parliament and parties, which would take 10-12 years to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. Therefore, for a transitional period, likely 10-12 years, the government will be a presidential republic with certain constitutional and institutional restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>. After this period, a referendum will be held to decide between a parliamentary or presidential republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

The speaker's own group, which aims to take power, comprises "almost exclusively people who think about the Motherland, about the Fatherland and about the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Such individuals are even present in the current Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. These forces also prioritize the development of intellectual potential, science, industry, education, and medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Role of Public Participation
The only guarantee that "adequate people" will come to power and avoid corruption is "direct participation in the political crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This public involvement is necessary to create "public guarantees" that the new government's course will serve society's interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Other mechanisms like separation of powers or parliamentary democracy are established later over time; initially, only public participation and control serve as guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. It is believed that public participation will strengthen, rather than undermine, the desire for continued political engagement, as people will witness a government capable of self-purification and learning from past mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

## Key [[internal_reforms_and_future_of_russian_governance | Reforms and Future Directions for Russia]]

### Judicial Reform
A comprehensive judicial reform is deemed essential for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This reform includes:
*   A broad amnesty with rehabilitation for unjustly convicted individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. It is estimated that up to a quarter of prisoners in Russia are incarcerated on illegal charges or should not be there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   Complete and unconditional lustration of the judicial corps, without exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This will be implemented gradually but fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
*   Changes to the judicial system itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The project for this judicial reform has already been developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

### Economic and Industrial Policy
One of the primary tasks of the new government will be to ensure the "secondary industrialization of the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This includes restarting production where feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, ensuring continued employment for those in manufacturing and aviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

### Migration Policy
The problem of migrants, ethnic criminal groups, and diasporas is believed to be solvable by the new government, unlike the current administration which lacks "goal-setting" and "political will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. The proposed solution involves:
*   **Goal-setting:** Migrants will only be allowed in Russia where needed by the Russian economy and society, and in quantities not exceeding these needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. Society and the state will determine the number of migrants, their specialties, and their locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. For example, migrants could be directed to specific areas like beyond the Arctic Circle if jobs are available there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   **Political Will:** The new state will possess the necessary political will to implement these policies, unlike the current state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

## Foreign Policy and Regional Issues
Regarding the conflict with Ukraine, some forces planning to come to power are ready to quickly end the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, while others are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. If security forces were to come to power, there is a possibility they might escalate military operations to improve their negotiating position, assuming a Ukrainian offensive is defeated and Russian forces could counter-offend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

Friendship between Russia and Ukraine is not expected, but "pragmatic relations" could be built "quite quickly" and "absolutely definitely in our lifetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>.

The [[possible_scenarios_for_russias_political_future | future of South Ossetia and Abkhazia]] will be decided after the political crisis in Russia concludes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. This will involve difficult political negotiations with all interested parties, and the issue is unlikely to be resolved quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

## Other Considerations
*   **Putin's Doubles:** If the real Putin dies, the doubles will not rule Russia, though they might temporarily replace him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. They were promised their original appearance back via plastic surgery and a huge sum of money, but whether these promises will be fulfilled is doubted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Kadyrov's Army:** The new government has solutions for Kadyrov and his army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. Cutting funding to this group will not lead to a scenario like the Prigozhin situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   **National Flag:** There is no definitive view on whether to change the Russian flag. It could be kept, similar to how Germany retained its flag despite past events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>, or a new one could be adopted, such as the flag of the 17th-century ship "Orel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

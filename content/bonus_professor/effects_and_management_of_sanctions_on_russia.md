## Impact of Sanctions
The cessation of warranty services by foreign companies for Russian manufacturing enterprises, including those producing compressors, has forced Russian engineers to perform repairs themselves. This situation carries a high probability of future accidents and technical excesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

### Economic Dependence on China
Russia has become increasingly dependent on China economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>. This dependence is partly attributed to past actions by (the late) Putin, who reportedly harbored animosity towards China and even attempted to "screw up China" with the COVID-19 epidemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. Consequently, Putin was allegedly forced to issue a "repentant apology" to the Chinese leadership, involving a humiliating video apology and the actual transfer of territories to China, initially disguised as rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>. This was done to secure China's support for Russia and prevent official demands for compensation regarding the COVID-19 epidemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.

## Management and Adaptation to Sanctions
Russia employs several strategies to manage and adapt to [[impact_and_adaptation_to_international_sanctions_on_russia | international sanctions]]:

*   **Technology Acquisition**: Western technological achievements are acquired by Russia through various means, as described by the late Putin: "they did something we tsap-tsap and it is already ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Import Substitution**: The current strategy of "import substitution" in Russia largely involves replacing Western products and machinery with Chinese alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. This approach aims to mitigate the problem of technical degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   **Budgetary Funding**: Large-scale projects, such as the construction of "super prisons" in 29 regions, are financed through the state budget, which is derived from taxes and deductions from the sale of energy resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This indicates that revenue from energy resources continues to fund government projects.

## Future Outlook Regarding Sanctions
A political group aiming for radical change in Russia anticipates that if they come to power, [[economic_sanctions_and_their_effects_on_russia | sanctions]] will be lifted "quite quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. This expectation is based on ongoing "regular consultations" with Western countries at high levels where decisions regarding sanction removal are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

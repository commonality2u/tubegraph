The [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia-Ukraine conflict]] has entered a critical phase, with significant shifts in [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | military and political dynamics]]. The situation is characterized by Ukrainian advances, Russian defensive actions, and growing internal challenges for the Russian military and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

## Current Military Actions and Strategic Initiative

Ukraine is actively pursuing offensive actions, which have shown notable success, particularly in the Kharkov region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. These events, occurring in the last 10 days of the recording, are seen not as a turning point yet, but as the *beginning* of a potential turning point in the armed confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

The Russian forces, on the other hand, are primarily engaged in defensive operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. The struggle for strategic initiative is in full swing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

## [[challenges_faced_by_russian_and_ukrainian_military_forces | Challenges Faced by Russian Military Forces]]

The Russian army is reported to be lacking several critical elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>:
*   **Forces and Means**: Insufficient personnel and equipment, especially modern equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Moral and Volitional Qualities**: A significant deficit in morale, faith in victory, and understanding of the meaning of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This deficit is growing chronically and could lead to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

### Strategic Retreats and Their Impact
The hasty withdrawal of Russian armed forces from the Kharkov region, described as a "voluntary gesture," has damaged trust among those who might cooperate with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. The inability to protect collaborators raises serious doubts about the reliability of Russian support, contrasting with previous assurances that "Russia is here forever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This has led to a growing disbelief in victory among both military personnel and the civilian population in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

### Use of Penal Battalions
Following the defeat in Kharkov, a plan emerged to use prisoners to participate in armed actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. This is likened to the creation of penal companies and battalions in 1942, which was also due to the failure of a Soviet army operation near Kharkov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. The formation of these de facto penal battalions is an admission that the Russian Federation cannot or is unwilling to carry out general mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

Penal battalions are historically not a decisive force in wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

### Opposition to Mobilization
Two key security officers, Patrushev and Bortnikov, reportedly spoke out harshly against mobilization, including partial mobilization, last week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. These individuals had previously developed a mobilization plan and reported its feasibility to Putin in the spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. Their objection is seen as a reaction to the political and physiological weakening of the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

## Geopolitical Implications and Russia's Diminished Influence

The recent SCO summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, was seen as a "failure" for Putin and Russia on several fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>:
*   **Image and Symbolic Failure**: Putin was met by the Prime Minister of Uzbekistan, while other leaders were met by the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Putin also had to wait for four state leaders for talks, including India, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Kyrgyzstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. A photograph from the summit depicted Erdogan in a prominent central chair, with Putin seated between two very tall presidents, Lukashenka and Tajikistan's president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. India's Prime Minister spoke to Putin in a "didactic tone," while China's Xi Jinping reportedly smiled ironically and shook his head with distrust at Putin's cheerful assertions that "Everything is going according to plan" in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Failure**: China and Turkey are successfully developing influence in the post-Soviet space, traditionally considered Russia's domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   China publicly stated it is a guarantor of Kazakhstan's sovereignty and territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Kazakhstan's president demonstratively avoided communicating with Putin at the summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
    *   The conflict between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan initially did not turn to Moscow for mediation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Putin had to offer his services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. These countries, traditionally clients of Russia, are behaving "quite insolently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
    *   In the Karabakh conflict, Azerbaijan has Turkey's support, while Armenia lacks Russia's backing. Russia offered to defend Armenia's territorial integrity only if it joined the union state, excluding Karabakh (which is not formally part of Armenia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This suggests Moscow is not a reliable mediator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
    *   The CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organization) is predicted to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, with Kazakhstan reportedly intending to suspend its membership next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The US is emerging as an alternative influence in the South Caucasus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Economic and Health Aspects

*   **Economic Failure**: Putin had little to offer summit participants beyond resources, mainly consumed by India and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. China rejected a proposal for a "Power of Siberia 2" gas pipeline, indicating no need for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Physiological/Health Failure**: Many at the summit observed Putin's "terrible physical and mental shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. A video shows Erdogan supporting Putin's elbow, suggesting he struggles to move at the same pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. High-load events like summits are reportedly no longer possible for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Reports also noted 12 doctors waited for him at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## International Stance and Peace Prospects

The United States has unilaterally withdrawn from consultations with Russia regarding ending [[russia_ukraine_conflict | military actions]] and a peace treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. A consensus has formed in the US to inflict a decisive military defeat on Russia to achieve political change in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>.

Ukraine is ready to negotiate only on the condition of complete liberation of all Ukrainian territories, including Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. This condition is considered "absolutely unacceptable" for the current Russian leadership, as it would mean a complete and final "fiasco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics in Russia

There is a growing sentiment within the Russian elite that they wish for Putin to "suddenly disappear" to take responsibility for the "special military operation" and other negative developments in Russia over the past 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

An assassination attempt on Putin was reported by a telegram channel known for accuracy, and picked up by Western media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. This attempt, though not fatal, is interpreted as a "public warning" from forces indicating they have long arms and can reach him, possibly hinting at demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.

Another suggested option for the Russian president is a "gradual departure" from power in a legalistic way, retiring into the shadows while attempting to rule Russia from behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. A small, effective personal State Council has reportedly already been formed, with its work potentially starting before the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

The speaker warns that time is speeding up in Russia, with changes happening extremely quickly and expected to worsen dramatically, possibly spasmodically, this fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. This deterioration is predicted to be primarily political, but will certainly affect the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

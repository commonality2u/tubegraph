The ruble exchange rate is predicted to decline again after a period of strengthening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This fall is considered inevitable due to the current state of the [[russian_economic_issues_and_potential_crises | Russian economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

### Broader Economic and Social Impacts

Official reports, such as those from Rosstat, indicate that the future for Russians, particularly in Moscow, is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. Many are burdened by loans, debts, and mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.

This [[economic_challenges_and_financial_management_in_russia | economic difficulty]] affects demographics, with some Russians finding it hard to raise even one child due to financial strain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>. In contrast, guests from former USSR neighboring countries are observed to have more children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:50:00">[11:50:00]</a>.

Demographic trends are deeply entrenched and cannot be quickly reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a>. Even with serious efforts starting now, any positive effects on birth rates among the indigenous population of the Russian Federation would likely only become apparent in 10-15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>. The speaker's team reportedly has a program to address this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.

Valery Solovey presents the sixth edition of "Answers to Hot Questions" in Moscow, addressing various queries from the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## [[Economic and Financial Challenges in Russia | Economic Challenges and Forecasts]]

### Inflation and Price Growth
Contrary to official statements, the accumulated inflation in Russia over three years (from 2012 to the end of 2015) is estimated to be no less than 90%, rather than the officially stated 28-29% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:50">[01:41:50]</a>. It is predicted that the rate of price growth will accelerate in the coming year, becoming higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>. This acceleration is particularly significant given that almost all sectors rely on imported components, despite claims of import substitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:40">[02:21:40]</a>.

### Currency Exchange Rates
The Central Bank management had predicted the cost of the dollar to be 120 rubles by the end of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:30">[01:53:30]</a>. For the first half of the next year, forecasts suggest an exchange rate of 150 rubles per dollar, not excluding the possibility of 200 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:02">[01:56:02]</a>.

Regarding currency purchases, it is advised to consider if one has the money to buy currency at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:04">[01:57:04]</a>. Old dollars (pre-2013) are accepted in the United States and European countries but not in places frequented by Russian compatriots like the Emirates or Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:04">[01:57:04]</a>. If purchasing currency, it is recommended to buy new dollars or euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:43">[01:43:43]</a>. The government cannot cancel the circulation of dollars issued before 2013, as dollars are issued by the United States; however, some banks may not accept them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:20">[04:22:20]</a>.

### Overall Economic Outlook
The year 2025 is projected to be harder for Russia than the outgoing year, while there is hope that 2026 will be easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

## Government Financial Measures

### Freezing Deposits and Denomination
The idea of freezing deposits has been postponed until the turn of spring/summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:05">[02:02:05]</a>. If conditions are introduced where smaller amounts (up to 1,400) are not touched, the general public might not oppose such measures and could even support them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:08">[02:07:08]</a>. There are several competing projects for freezing deposits, and answers to detailed questions about limits on salaries and accounts will be provided on the Telegram channel "global crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:50">[03:14:50]</a>.

### Foreign Investors
There are ongoing discussions about measures concerning foreign investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:28">[02:28:28]</a>. A specific group within the elite is actively trying to prevent certain critical actions against foreign investors, and they have achieved a significant amount so far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:19">[02:39:19]</a>.

### Cryptocurrency
The Russian authorities are not preparing to arrest or confiscate cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:54">[04:07:54]</a>. This is because they widely use cryptocurrency themselves as a tool for circumventing sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:16">[04:08:16]</a>. Crypto platforms are under the control of the FSB, and all transactions are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:24">[04:28:24]</a>. Transactions exceeding $20 attract interest, but smaller amounts (tens of thousands of dollars) are generally not of significant interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:10">[04:49:10]</a>.

### Retirement Age
The issue of returning to the previous retirement age and compensating those who did not receive their pension is being considered after a change in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

### Other Economic Aspects
*   **Toll Roads and Clinics**: These facilities will remain, but there must always be a free, high-quality alternative. While private options offer faster service for money, the same quality should be available in public facilities, though possibly with a longer wait time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:30">[03:38:30]</a>.
*   **Bookmakers**: Bookmakers are expected to survive any financial reforms, as they generate colossal profits and the government does not want to fight them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
*   **Fighting Fraudulent Schemes**: There is a 100% chance to strengthen the fight against fraudulent schemes, as the protectors of these schemes are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:04">[04:57:04]</a>. Experts believe it would take up to six months to stop mass telephone and other forms of fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

## Return to the Civilized World
Returning to the civilized world for Russia means getting rid of illusions and corrupt officials who currently rule the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:09">[03:41:09]</a>. A civilized world is defined as one where people are not morally or psychologically abused, their privacy is respected, they are not interfered with in work or business, and they are not encouraged to participate in mass murder under the guise of patriotism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. It is a place where women are respected, animals are valued, roads are good, people are treated well, and pensioners receive adequate support in a resource-rich country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. It represents a normal, decent, and peaceful human life, free from constant violence against one's own people and attempts to project that violence globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. To achieve this, Russia must give up self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

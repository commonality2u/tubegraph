The topic of [[occult_warriors_of_the_kremlin|occult warriors of the Kremlin]] and the influence of [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia|occultism]] on Russian politics is discussed in detail. A key case illustrating this phenomenon is that of Alexander Gabyshev, a self-proclaimed shaman from Yakutsk.

## The Case of Shaman Alexander Gabyshev

Alexander Gabyshev, an "unemployed self-employed shaman," was forcibly sent to a psychiatric hospital by court order for psychiatric care and treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. This isolation is interpreted as an attempt to control perceived "magical properties" associated with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. Political scientist Valery Solovey suggests that the root cause of this action was not primarily political, but rather [[mystical_beliefs_among_russian_elite|magical]] or [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia|occult]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

According to Solovey, there was a direct order from the President of the Russian Federation to "stab the shaman with drugs" to render him into a "vegetable state" or to ensure he would cease any "socially significant initiatives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. This drastic measure was taken just days after Gabyshev announced he had conducted a ritual to "drive out evil spirits from the Kremlin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. The fact that the supreme leadership of the country took this action indicates they take such [[influence_of_occult_practices_in_russian_politics|magical practices]] seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

## Nature of the Shamanic Rite

Philosopher Andrey, a guest expert, clarifies the nature of the shamanic rite Gabyshev claimed to perform. Gabyshev belongs to a cultural type of shaman whose worldview is based on mythology and folklore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. The "rite of the stolen soul," which Gabyshev implicitly referenced, is specific to the Siberian-Mongolian cultural group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.

The essence of this ritual involves a shaman journeying to the lower world to fight a demon that has stolen a person's soul, ultimately returning it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. Crucially, the individual whose soul is believed to be stolen **must** actively participate in the ritual; it cannot be performed remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>. This means a remote ritual targeting Vladimir Putin would not be effective according to the shamanic tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. The ritual typically lasts no more than nine hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>.

From an esoteric viewpoint, Gabyshev's activities are considered relatively benign compared to more sinister practices like Voodoo or the "13 World Occult Orders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.

### Psychiatric Implications and Punitive Psychiatry
Natalia Petrovna Bekhtereva, a renowned neurophysiologist, stated that "the use of psychiatry for punitive purposes gives rise to even greater evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>. Andrey argues that Alexander Gabyshev's danger to society or himself, as alleged in his forced psychiatric treatment, lacks convincing evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>. Gabyshev did not storm populated areas, take hostages, threaten violence, or destroy infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>. He also showed no signs of self-harm or suicidal tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>. Andrey concludes that Gabyshev is an "ordinary person" with a different worldview, likening him to Don Quixote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>.

## Occult Interests in the Kremlin

### Historical Context and Modern Practices
The fascination with [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia|occult practices]] within Russian authorities is not new, with historical parallels such as Grigori Rasputin's influence at the Romanov court in the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>. Rasputin was seen not only as a healer for the Tsarevich but also exerted political influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:55:00">[19:55:00]</a>. This historical context highlights how Russian power, particularly in moments of perceived helplessness, seeks "magical help" to resist challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>.

The current [[influence_of_occult_practices_in_russian_politics|occult practices in Russian politics]] are described as far exceeding anything seen historically, including the early 20th century or even Nazi esotericism like the Ahnenerbe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>. The current Russian establishment exhibits an unprecedented level of involvement in such practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>. This intense interest, especially since 2014, is driven by a desire not just to foresee the future, but to actively *influence* it in the "right direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

Valery Solovey attributes this to a combination of:
*   Extreme mental instability within the ruling elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>.
*   An "artificial sublimation" of power, where individuals from "average" backgrounds suddenly find themselves at the top, leading them to seek rationalization and believe in their "chosenness" by higher powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:00">[22:26:00]</a>.
*   The search for a "ring of omnipotence" to solve complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02:00">[23:02:00]</a>.

### Specific Occult Practices in the Kremlin

The current elite uses various occult methods to influence decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. These practices are conducted for a very narrow circle of "initiates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.
*   **Eastern Esotericism**: Initially, there was interest in Eastern esotericism, including Tao, Zen, and the ability to predict the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
*   **Nooscope Concept**: The "Nooscope" is seen as a quasi-rational attempt to explain magical abilities, functioning like a crystal ball to see the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>.
*   **Psychoactive Substances**: High-ranking officials engage in "flights to Nibiru" or "flights to Sirius" using natural alkaloids that grow in Russia, such as atropine, hyoscyamine, and psilocybin mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:00">[31:30:00]</a>.
    *   "Flights to Nibiru" are based on a mix of intercontinental myths, with a reptilian main character, requiring a circle for the ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:21:00">[30:21:00]</a>.
    *   "Flights to Sirius" are based on recycled Dogon mythology, featuring two-headed entities, and require a triangle for the ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:48:00">[30:48:00]</a>.
    *   These "flights" are induced by a "conductor" (experienced person) and alkaloids, leading to vivid, colorful hallucinations where participants believe they communicate with entities and receive answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:14:00">[31:14:00]</a>. The use of these substances can lead to addiction, personal degradation, and a shifted reality, affecting decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:37:00">[34:37:00]</a>.
*   **Rituals involving Corpses and Blood**: More recent, relevant, and popular practices include "water" and "Santa Muerte" cults in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:40:00">[46:40:00]</a>.
    *   **Water Cult (for evil)**: This involves digging up a fresh corpse (preferably a maniac killer or suicide victim) from a cemetery, cutting it into pieces, and mixing it with grave soil in a barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:57:00">[47:57:00]</a>. Live birds are placed on effigies in the soil and must die in agony to "cleanse" the grave soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:25:00">[48:25:00]</a>. A doll (made of carved wood, resembling the "victim") is then soaked in a composition of human blood and plant juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:56:00">[48:56:00]</a>. After burial in the grave soil and a period of time, the doll is exhumed and fed with "the blood of a virgin and the sperm of men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:57:00">[49:57:00]</a>. Iron objects are then driven into the doll during a final ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27:00">[50:27:00]</a>. One doll remains with the adepts, while a second is sent to the intended "victim," relying on psychological impact if the recipient believes in the ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:38:00">[50:38:00]</a>. An example of a high-ranking businessman receiving such a doll in November 2019 was cited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:05:00">[51:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Santa Muerte Cult**: This practice uses a long-rotted corpse (a "mummy"), which is washed, rubbed with incense, adorned with a golden crown and precious jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:55:00">[51:55:00]</a>. Followers consider it necessary to possess a human skull, specifically from an "influential person of high rank," believing that possessing a "fool's skull" will make them a fool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:43:00">[52:43:00]</a>. This cult, originating in Mexico, is also very "bloody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:57:00">[53:57:00]</a>.
*   **Grimoires**: There is an active acquisition of original grimoires (books of magic) at European auctions by Russian buyers, who believe the originals possess special power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:36:00">[37:36:00]</a>.
*   **Occult War**: Those deeply involved in these practices believe they have entered an "occult war" against two or three "very powerful" entities, possibly the 13 World Occult Orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:41:00">[39:41:00]</a>.

These rituals are often performed by "operators" or "conductors" who are highly skilled and charge "colossal, simply unimaginable money" for their services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:19:00">[38:19:00]</a>. Information about these secret rituals sometimes leaks through these operators or support staff (security, referents) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:44:00">[41:44:00]</a>.

### Relationship with the Traditional Church

The traditional church, specifically Russian Orthodoxy, has a complex relationship with these [[occult_rituals_and_psychiatry_in_russia|occult practices]]. There are three main strategies observed within the church: avoidance and condemnation, calm acceptance, and direct participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:04:00">[55:04:00]</a>. Some members of the church participate in these practices, believing it to be a "real path to power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:30:00">[55:30:00]</a>.

The Russian elite, in their search for a powerful force to assist them, are increasingly turning away from Orthodoxy. While ten years ago there was an attempt to return to Orthodox roots, the last five or six years have seen a clear departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:37:00">[56:37:00]</a>. Andrey suggests that various religious and occult niches "get along quite well and peacefully" in Russia today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:11:00">[58:11:00]</a>. He also points out that the Russian Orthodox Church was directly supervised by the KGB's 5th Main Directorate, leading to skepticism among the educated elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:37:00">[58:37:00]</a>.

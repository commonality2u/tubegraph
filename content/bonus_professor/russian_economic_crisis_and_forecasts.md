The [[the_economic_situation_in_Russia_and_its_future_prospects | economic situation in Russia]] is characterized by "negative economic growth and negative employment growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Despite official statements from President Vladimir Putin claiming "everything is going according to plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a> and that "there will be no mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, the speaker notes a "pathologically sick logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a> in these contradictory statements, suggesting that any result, even negative, can be called "planned" if the plan is unknown to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Economic Forecasts and Outlook
[[russian_economic_and_financial_outlook | Economic forecasts]] for Russia are becoming increasingly grim, particularly from unofficial sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

*   **Alfa Bank Forecast**: Economist Natalia Orlova predicts that Russia's GDP in 2023 will decrease by 6.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This would represent the largest and most significant fall in Russian GDP since 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The speaker highlights that independent economists like Orlova are not subject to the same "topic restrictions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a> as state institutions, potentially making their forecasts more accurate.
*   **Official Forecasts**:
    *   The Central Bank forecasts a GDP fall of only 2% to 2.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
    *   The Ministry of Economic Development predicts a fall of less than 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

The current [[russian_economic_issues_and_potential_crises | crisis in Russia]] is seen as having a different nature, implying that a quick recovery should not be expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Key factors contributing to this outlook include a decrease in domestic demand, export restrictions, and a decline in investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Employment and Population Decline
The economic difficulties are reflected in employment figures. What is termed "negative increase in employment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> or "unemployment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> indicates a dangerous trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. By the beginning of summer, 13% of Russia's working-age population (4.3 million people) were on unpaid, partially paid leave, or idle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Furthermore, there is a significant decline in the population:
*   In October 2022, the birth rate in Russia fell by 11% compared to the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   The population has decreased by half a million people since the beginning of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

This trend raises concerns about Russia potentially turning into a "land free of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, where a small "elite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> rules alongside 5-7 million "servants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, a vision currently being realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Government Response and Public Mood
The government's strategy to cope with the [[russian_economic_challenges_and_ruble_instability | challenging economic situation]] and public discontent is evident in the federal budget for 2023-2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>:
*   Expected tax collection will decrease by 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
*   Oil and gas budget revenues are projected to decrease by 24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   There will be a sharp reduction in spending on supporting the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   A record increase in financing for "unarmed forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a> including police, national guard, FSB, and Federal Protective Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Every third ruble will go to the security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, with a quarter of the budget classified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

This approach is described as "sitting on bayonets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>, a strategy that can only last "for a very, very short time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Putin's popularity is noted to be at "record lows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, and public discontent is increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, leading the authorities to try to avoid disturbing people with persistent reassurances of "no mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Russian Officials and a "Second Homeland"
Adding to the internal challenges, there are rumors that Russian officials are actively seeking a "second homeland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a> as a place to "lie low after the regime collapses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. Latin America is dismissed as a viable option due to predominant US influence, where no representative of the Russian elite would be safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. Instead, Africa is identified as the true location for these "bases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, which include luxury housing, reserves of currencies and precious metals, and protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. The presence of the Wagner private military company in Africa is cited as an example of security arrangements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.

This situation suggests that for the Russian elite, counting on a military victory, public support, or a secure escape route has become increasingly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

Russian political and military strategies are currently shaped by internal disagreements, ongoing military operations, and attempts to exert external pressure. Decisions are influenced by the perceived success (or lack thereof) of military actions and the varying opinions within the ruling elites regarding the conflict's objectives and conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

## Military Objectives and Divisions within Elites

The State Duma meeting on June 15th, 2022, did not result in the anticipated "cardinal options" such as the announcement of martial law in border regions with Ukraine, reflecting a hesitancy from the Russian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:15">[02:15:15]</a>. This hesitation is attributed to the less-than-successful course of the [[military_and_strategic_implications_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | special military operation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> and the differing moods among the ruling elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

Two main viewpoints have emerged within the elite regarding the conflict's outcome:
*   **Majority View** The majority, including the military, advocates for being content with the current territorial acquisitions and then negotiating a truce or agreement with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
*   **Radical Minority View** A radical, but influential, minority believes Russia must fight to a "victorious end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. This entails taking control of Kharkiv, Dnipro (formerly Dnepropetrovsk), the entire Black Sea coast (including Mykolaiv and Odesa regions), and potentially even entering and taking control of Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

The first option (stopping and negotiating) is deemed unacceptable by Ukraine and its active Western supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. The second option (fighting to the end) is considered unlikely to be implemented from a military standpoint, given the events of the preceding five months on the Ukrainian front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

## Diplomatic and Coercive Strategies

The Kremlin seeks a way out of the current situation by attempting to pressure Europe to, in turn, pressure Ukraine into agreeing to terms favorable to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. This strategy involves both economic and forceful blackmail:
*   **Economic Blackmail** This is primarily manifested through "gas blackmail," which has been "quite successful" in aggravating economic problems in Europe, leading to rising energy prices and potential internal crises in European countries, such as the one observed in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.
*   **Forceful Blackmail** Russia hints at "possibilities of force blackmail" that have not yet been utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. Leaks from a closed session of the Security Council meeting on July 15th were reportedly directed at "unfriendly" Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. These leaks allegedly discussed "extremely unpleasant and simply unpleasant" measures of influence on Europe, intended as a signal to pressure Kyiv towards reconciliation on [[Russian military actions and global reactions | Russian terms]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. The leaks are also intended to warn Ukraine against a potential counteroffensive, which Ukrainian officials periodically discuss and which is reportedly scheduled for August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. [[Speculation on Russias future political and military actions | Analytical assessments]] received by the Russian leadership indicate a "quite real" threat of losing the Kherson region in the event of such a counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.

## Economic and Technological Strategies

The Kremlin is preparing for a long confrontation, embracing the idea of a "besieged fortress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. A key component of this strategy is the shift from a market economy to a "strategy of technological sovereignty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. This concept, defined as "poetics of isolationism" and an attempt to create an independent base for high-tech production, is compared to countries like North Korea and Iran, with North Korea's technological development likened to the USSR of the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

Denis Manturov, appointed Vice-Premier responsible for import substitution, is now also responsible for achieving technological sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. However, past import substitution policies have shown significant declines in production:
*   Car production fell by 97% in May 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.
*   Passenger buses by 77% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.
*   Diesel locomotives by 63% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.
*   Washing machines by 59% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.
*   Refrigerators by 58% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.
*   Freight cars by 52% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.
*   Passenger cars by 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>.

It is predicted that "technological sovereignty" will yield similar ineffective results, with money disappearing into "black holes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.

## Internal Political Strategies and Public Opinion

Closed surveys reveal diverse opinions on the [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | special military operation]] within [[Russian internal political dynamics | Russian society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>:
*   Approximately one-third of Russians believe the operation should be stopped immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.
*   Among young people (18-24), 56% are in favor of stopping, while only 19% support continuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.
*   Among those aged 25-34, 43% favor continuation, and 41% favor stopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>.
*   The majority (72%) who insist on continuing the operation and "denazification" of Ukraine are respondents over 60 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.
*   Among Internet users (their main source of information), 47% favor stopping the operation, while 35% favor continuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.
*   Among TV viewers (their main source of information), the opposite trend is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.

The Kremlin is bolstering television's influence with repressive policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>. Recent amendments to the criminal code signed by the Russian president include:
*   Public calls to action against Russia's security: up to 7 years in prison and a fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.
*   Repeated propaganda or public demonstration of Nazi symbols or extremist organizations (e.g., Facebook, Instagram logos): up to 4 years in prison or a fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>.
*   Confidential cooperation with foreign countries: 2 to 8 years in prison with a fine of up to one million rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>.

These repressive amendments are being adopted due to a lack of confidence in mass nationwide support for the [[russian_military_tactics_in_ukraine | special military operation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>. The apparent support is being enforced through legislative "barrier detachments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:00">[17:39:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Risks

The possibility of mobilization in the fall is not excluded, especially if Ukraine launches a successful counteroffensive, making it potentially the "only alternative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>.

August is anticipated to be a period of increased "political turbulence" for two reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:00">[18:36:00]</a>:
1.  The armed confrontation between [[geopolitical_strategies_and_positioning_of_russia | Russia]] and Ukraine is very likely to enter a new phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>.
2.  Important decisions regarding the "transit of supreme power" within [[russian_political_dynamics and power struggles | Russian politics]] may be made, including the potential appearance of a new prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>.

The new criminal code amendments significantly increase risks for anyone engaged in political commentary, leading to a need for self-censorship or suspension of such activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a>.

Valery Solovey discusses various aspects of potential future reforms and rehabilitation efforts in Russia, addressing questions from his audience regarding the political, economic, and social systems.

## Current System's Resilience and Future Challenges

The current Russian political and economic system has shown survivability despite "destructive terminal sanctions" imposed nearly three years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This resilience is attributed to:
*   **Gradual Sanctions:** Sanctions were imposed progressively, allowing the system time to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Economic Safety Margin:** The Russian economy's safety margin proved "much higher than expected" due to "unaccounted for things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **People's Patience:** The "long-suffering people" of the Russian Federation have repeatedly helped authorities navigate problems and "save itself in many, many times and eras" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

However, this patience is now "on the verge of exhaustion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Experts and those involved in the "transit plan" do not place primary hopes on the people "waking up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Discontent within the elite, and "fundamental differences," extend beyond military actions and concern the "future paths of development of Russia" and its "ideology of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. These contradictions are now surfacing and are "irreconcilable and insurmountable within the framework of the model that was created in Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, often referred to as the "Putin model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## Planned [[sociopolitical_changes_and_reforms_in_russia | Reforms]] Under a New Government

A new government is expected to implement significant [[reforms_and_future_strategies_for_russias_governance and_social_systems | reforms]] across various sectors.

### [[russian_legal_and_penal_system_reforms | Legal and Judicial Reforms]]

*   **Criminal Code Revision:** A "radical revise" of the Criminal Code is planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. The current system is criticized for being too soft on violent crimes, while minor offenses, especially "statements," carry disproportionately long sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Judicial Corps Lustration:** There will be a "complete, total lustration of the judicial corps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Release and Rehabilitation of Prisoners:**
    *   One of the "first steps" of the new government will be the release of "all [[judicial_reform_and_political_prisoners_in_russia | political prisoners]] and all those innocently convicted" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, including those not necessarily convicted under political articles but "blatantly" wronged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
    *   These individuals will receive "full rehabilitation, including financial rehabilitation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
    *   A special agency will be created to deal with the "restoration of violated constitutional rights of Russian citizens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

### Accountability for Propagandists and Informers

*   **Propagandists:** Those who engaged in "massive and quite effective propaganda work" will be brought to criminal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Their actions are classified under Russian criminal law and require legal judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. They are expected to face "Basmanny justice," which is considered "much more unpleasant" than an international tribunal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Informers:** The "last names, first names, patronymics of all informers will be named" publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. Victims of false denunciations will be able to go to court and win, with informers compelled to compensate material losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>. Trolls, like informers, will also be named <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>.

### Media Transformation

Russian television will not "go down in history" but its "vector of activity" and "propaganda that television sends" will change by 180 degrees, beginning to "tell us the truth" on command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.

### Return of Citizens

The overwhelming majority of people who left Russia due to military actions and the current regime are expected to return to a "New Russia" that will be "fundamentally different" and offer opportunities they previously lacked or were denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.

## Prospects for [[potential_government_reforms_and_policies_in_russia | Changes]] and Improvement

*   **Political Changes:** The "intra-elite dynamics" for the first time in Russia's history have a chance to "direct the country in the right positive direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. These changes are expected to serve the interests of society and the country at large, not just specific groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. The mechanism of change may resemble "palace coups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>.
*   **Initial "Bells" of Progress:** Visible progress will initially manifest as changes in the general atmosphere, such as the release of political prisoners, refusal to block YouTube, and cessation of blocking social networks deemed "hostile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>. This will allow people to "breathe more freely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.
*   **Socio-economic Recovery:** Due to "colossal inertia" in social and economic dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>, immediate improvement is not expected. The first signs of economic recovery are anticipated "at the turn of the next year" (approximately one year from now) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. Overcoming the crisis fully is projected to take "at least 2 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

The speaker expects to be with his audience through the "most turbulent and probably the most threatening times in the last 30 years of Russian history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.

This article explores the perceived [[influence_of_occultism_in_russian_politics | influence of occultism in Russian politics]], particularly shamanism and other magical practices, drawing insights from an interview with Andrey Kosmach, a specialist in occultism in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Kosmach is recognized as an expert in this field in Europe and North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## The Bon Ritual and Political Fortune

A significant point of discussion is the "Bon" ritual, which was allegedly performed in June of the previous year (2020) and directed against Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Historical Context of Bon Religion
The Bon religion is considered one of the world's most complex and mysterious religions, with origins in the prehistoric period lacking written monuments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. There are two main historical versions:
*   **Old Bon:** An "indivisible and eternal" practice found in Nepal, Tibet, and Western Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **New Bon:** Adapted to Buddhism and distinct from the eternal Bon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Modern manifestations, such as those in Nepal, are described as eclectic performances with elements of Gallic and Tibetan dance, and animal sacrifice, often conducted by Buddhist monks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

Bon has faced serious persecution from "peace-loving" Buddhists for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Twentieth-century pseudo-studies, aimed at depicting Bon as bloody and cruel, were often based on Buddhist sources or author's imagination, without direct contact with Bon priests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. For example, Nikolai Roerich's book *Altai Himalaya* compared Bon with Christianity and concluded it was an evil phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

Authentic Bon rituals are shrouded in multi-stage secrecy and transcend the rational, taking place in hard-to-reach, labyrinthine caves in the Nepalese Himalayas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The fundamental practice in Bon is the achievement of a state of non-duality, where the discrepancy between feeling and reason is overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This knowledge is kept secret because modern humans are not considered capable of understanding these harmonious practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

### The Anti-Putin Ritual
On June 21, 2020, during a solar eclipse, a ritual was performed in Corrigan Taxcom, Nepal, to create an "egregor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. An egregor is a non-material, complex energy substance that can change the trajectory of an individual's fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. This ritual was directed at the President of the Russian Federation, whose fate is connected to the entire post-Soviet space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

The crucial periods in the formation of an egregor are its central part and the culmination of maximum strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   **Central part formation:** The Khabarovsk protests occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
*   **Maximum strength (fiftieth day):** Elections in Belarus developed into large-scale protests, which "canceled the project of unification" of Russia and Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

> From August 9, 2020, it can be stated that the "luck factor" abandoned the leader, and fortune turned its back on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

While metaphysical practices can create fluctuations in the vector of movement and awaken the masses from "pseudo-wakefulness," real change requires the free will and actions of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

> [!INFO] Government Response to the Ritual
> The Federal Security Service (FSB) was instructed to verify this information and received full confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Specialists sent by the Kremlin traveled to China and then Balkhash, where lamas confirmed the ritual's occurrence and its irreversible nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. Tibetan Buddhism is not able to cancel the final effect of these rituals because it lacks key details of the Bon practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

## [[Shamanic rituals related to the Kremlin | Shamanic Practices and the Russian Government]]
President Putin is known to communicate with shamans during his visits to Shoigu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

### Shamanic Initiation and Authenticity
Shamanism divides the world into everyday and sacred realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. While shamans across continents share common features, their distinctive features, especially concerning the initiation rite, dominate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

In Russia, the algorithm for shamanic initiation has been largely lost due to relentless suppression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. Most algorithms and rituals were preserved only through the efforts of historian-scientists from the late 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.

Key aspects of authentic shamanic initiation include:
*   **Shamanic gift:** Passed down by inheritance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.
*   **Chosenness by spirits:** Spirits mentally encourage the individual onto the path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.
*   **Shamanic disease:** A special condition manifesting in childhood indicating chosenness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>.
*   **Formation period:** Seven to twelve years of study and conceptual learning under an experienced shaman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
*   **Clan council:** Recognizes the initiate's right to be a shaman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.
*   **Multi-day ceremony:** Led by a mentor shaman who first instills a specific spirit to determine the correctness of the rite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. Only a shaman with a "crown and cane" has the right to instill this spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.
*   **Elixir and purification:** Ablution, preparation of an elixir (hallucinogenic mushrooms or tracks), and purification by smoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.
*   **Sacrificial ritual:** Slaughter of a sacrificial animal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:35">[00:27:35]</a>.
*   **Presentation of attributes:** Shamanic crown, staff, whip, tambourine, beater, and a costume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:48">[00:27:48]</a>.
*   **Independent shamanizing:** The young shaman calls on spirits for strength and blessing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.
*   **Culmination:** Vision of ancestral spirits entering the shaman's body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.
*   **Spirit possession:** The initiation is complete when spirits take possession of the shaman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>.
*   **Original spirit's return:** Determines the quality of the ritual and reveals hidden knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. Followed by another ablution and blessings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Modern Vulgarization
> The modern vulgarization of shamanism has led to a significant simplification of its theory and practice, often using previously unacceptable elements and absorbing local traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. Knowledge about shamanism in Russia is fragmented, leading to more versions and hypotheses than answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.

A historical version suggests cruel repressive measures against shamanic communities in young Soviet Russia stemmed from an incident involving Joseph Stalin (Vissarion Dzhugashvili) in 1914 in Turukhansk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>. Stalin, then in exile, sided with a local prince against a shaman for the position of clan council chairman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>.

### Government's Engagement with Pseudo-Shamans
The Russian government and elite, despite the lack of reliable confirmation of authentic shamanic initiation among many self-proclaimed shamans, consult them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. The government views these consultations as a "placebo effect" that calms them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. This engagement is seen as a way for the government to seek legitimacy for its power claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[Influence of occult practices in Russian politics | Occult Practices in Russian Politics]]
> The government itself believes in shamans as protectors and consults them on various issues, including pension reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. It also hopes that shamans can protect the regime from external influences and the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.

The government's creation of this "trend" leads other parts of society to actively integrate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>, as seen in the instance of a shaman being called during the announcement of actor Efremov's verdict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:04">[00:36:04]</a>. This trend is described as a "vulgarization" of shamanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.

## Black Magic and Grimoires
Interest in "black magic" is growing in Russia, with people seeking out "home-grown specialists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.

> [!INFO] Authentic vs. Pseudo-Grimoires
> According to Kosmach, black magic lacks historical roots and is not a conceptual product of powerful sorcerers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. All known works in this segment are creations of the Holy Roman Inquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>. These "pseudo-works" are fabrications of inquisitor monks from the late Middle Ages, often created by erasing authentic texts and writing new, distorted ones to create a fictitious enemy for the Christian ideological doctrine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

Genuine grimoires, used by 13 great occult orders, are based on ancient ritual tracts like the Minoan tract and Medici family manuscripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. These are "a book in a book," requiring the use of two seemingly different grimoires to perform a single ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>. Genuine grimoires contain no mention of the devil or demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:05">[00:44:05]</a>, unlike pseudo-grimoires that feature numerous demons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>.

The Russian pseudo-establishment prefers rituals "oversaturated with dream fate and ceremonial theatricality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. They use an eclectic mix of pseudo-grimoires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:56">[00:49:56]</a>. A high-ranking Russian official stated that Satanism for him is a tool for "justification of the present and the prospect of the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>, comparing church visits to attending CPSU party meetings – something done out of necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:07">[00:51:07]</a>. In Europe, this trend has existed for centuries, while in Russia, it's only two decades old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.

Occultism, in principle, is opposite to faith; any ritual action must be experimentally confirmed and repeatable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. A study in the 1970s by an occult order found that 97% of known rituals are "empty and spoons" (useless) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>. Authentic grimoires are inaccessible to most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

## [[Exploration of experiential rituals like Ayahuasca | Ayahuasca and Modern Elite Rituals]]
A popular trend among the Russian elite is traveling to the Amazon to participate in Ayahuasca rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:11">[00:54:11]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Commercialization of Ayahuasca
> In indigenous mythology, Ayahuasca is a divine gift, only to be used by those for whom it was intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>. Revealing its secret to strangers can anger the gods, punishing the tribe with diseases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:38">[00:55:38]</a>. However, the temptation of money leads many tribes to a "trick," offering pilgrims a complex decoction that gives a similar hallucinogenic effect but is not authentic Ayahuasca <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>.

Authentic Ayahuasca consists of two components (liana copy with harmines and dimethyltryptamine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. Its preparation takes many hours during daylight, consumed after sunset, and only used in special ceremonies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:52">[00:56:52]</a>.

The actual ritual sequence, consisting of three main stages, is guarded:
1.  **Preparation:** Before the ceremony, dedicated participants are given entheogens (plant-based products influencing the psyche) to reset consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:19">[00:58:19]</a>. This is crucial for entering a trance and going through a "hallucination," avoiding a mixture of new experiences and old memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:41">[00:58:41]</a>. This process is called "walking through the evening fog" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:14">[00:59:14]</a>.
2.  **Transpersonal Journey:** After exiting the "fog," Ayahuasca is consumed, initiating a "transpersonal trip" for 4-6 hours where boundaries of space and time disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:26">[00:59:26]</a>.
3.  **Return to Body:** After the trip, another entheogen is given to allow the "eternal spirit to return to its body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.

Wealthy pilgrims typically experience a commercialized version. They fly by private helicopter to an "ethnographic village" built specifically for such cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:20">[01:01:20]</a>. The "villagers" are actors, and the ritual involves drinking a decoction, leading to "high-quality hallucinosis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:46">[01:02:46]</a>. These experiences cost from half a million to several million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:19">[01:07:19]</a>.

Some "advanced" elite members consider traditional shamanic rituals "atavism" and use a wide range of alkaloids for trance, such as Bufotenin from the Colorado River toad and psilocybin mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. Traveling shamans visiting Russia and Ukraine are considered charlatans running a "commercial project" for wealthy "fools," telling clients what they want to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>.

## The Cup of the Blind King
The "Cup of the Blind King" grimoire is an authentic ritual from the collection of Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:05">[01:09:05]</a>.
*   **Key attribute:** A golden cup filled with anthropomorphic (human) blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:14">[01:09:14]</a>.
*   **Process:** The cup is placed on a hot surface with an open fire, then cut in half, spilling its contents onto the hot surface, creating a violent reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>.
*   **Seal of Death:** From the two parts of the cup, a "golden seal of death" is cast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>.
*   **Spells:** Thirty-three spells are written on leather scrolls, sealed, and then burned on the same surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:38">[01:10:38]</a>. The resulting ash is used to make the "seal of death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>.

This ritual was performed on December 14, 2020, during a solar eclipse in Rio Negro, Argentina, with related variations in Nepal and Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>. Its implementation is associated with undermining mental order, creating "mental epidemics," and destroying identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>. It is extremely difficult to counteract this ritual, as any experimental counter-attempts will only strengthen its effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:57">[01:12:57]</a>.

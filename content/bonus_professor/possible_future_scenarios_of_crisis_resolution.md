From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The current situation indicates a significant escalation of military action rather than a move towards crisis resolution. The Kremlin's recent actions, particularly the massive missile strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure, signify a rejection of peace proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This rejection implies a deliberate choice to intensify the conflict. The tragic incident in Poland, involving missile strikes, is unlikely to trigger NATO's Article 5, as no one in NATO appears interested in such an activation at this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Escalation of Military Action
The current phase marks an [[potential_future_mobilization_and_military_strategies | escalation of military action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, moving into a more dangerous stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Russian President Putin has reportedly adopted a "spearhead of counter-escalation" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, understanding that this will lead to an increase in military power and strikes on Russian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Ukrainian Response
Following Russia's categorical rejection of [[peace_negotiations_and_conflict_resolution | peace proposals]], Ukraine is expected to receive new, longer-range weaponry, including ammunition, missiles, and potentially drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This means that not only border regions but also areas deeper within Russia, including Central Russia, will be within the zone of destruction for Ukrainian armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Efforts are already underway to inspect and ensure the readiness of Russia's air defense system in Central Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Ukraine is also expected to launch new offensives, with initial reports suggesting an offensive on Popasnaya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Russian Strategy
Russia is expected to continue its massive shelling campaigns, provided it has sufficient missile stockpiles or receives them from allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. However, a major offensive or counteroffensive by Russian armed forces in Ukraine is deemed unlikely, as Russia has adopted a concept of strategic defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Consequences of Escalation within Russia

### Mobilization and Military Strategies
Despite President Putin's declaration that mobilization is over, the lack of a regulatory document means military enlistment offices continue to receive mobilization calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The second stage of [[potential_future_mobilization_and_military_strategies | mobilization]] is anticipated after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. However, if Ukrainian offensives are successful, this second stage, or an "additional mobilization," could be accelerated, sending even currently training mobilized personnel to the front lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Expansion of Conflict Zone
Escalation could lead to the involvement of NATO countries most actively assisting Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. While the United States is excluded, Russia may carry out "symmetrical strikes" on these countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, possibly involving cyber attacks or sabotage of logistics hubs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. The conflict zone is expected to expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

### Internal Restrictions and Economic Mobilization
Martial law, currently limited to Ukraine's "new territories," may be extended to Russian regions bordering Ukraine, and eventually to major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Potential Restrictions Under Martial Law
> If martial law is introduced, it will bring further restrictions on civil liberties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This includes:
> *   Restrictions on freedom of movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
> *   Introduction of curfews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
> *   New "hybrid authorities" (military-civilian administrations or military commandants) gaining the power to detain citizens without trial for 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
> *   The right to confiscate property (e.g., vehicles, equipment) from citizens and enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

The economy will undergo further "non-stateization" and mobilization, with the share of the economy connected to the special military operation increasing beyond the current estimated 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Declining Popularity and State Instability
Putin's popularity is reportedly declining rapidly, while readiness for protest moods is growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The authorities' only known response is to "tighten the screws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This tightening risks breaking the "rusty threads" of the state structure, which is already showing signs of falling apart, as evidenced by the behavior of figures like Kadyrov operating outside the Russian legal field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## Prediction of Major Crisis
The military confrontation is inevitably developing into a [[political_crisis_prediction_and_influence | political crisis]], a large-scale and acute one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. This will lead to a colossal [[geopolitical_consequences_and_crisis_predictions_in_Russia | crisis]] and potentially the [[possible_scenarios_for_russias_political_future | collapse of Russian statehood]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

### Putin's Dilemma and Strategy
Putin is believed to face a dilemma of either admitting loss or using tactical nuclear weapons, an idea currently on hold but not taboo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. His personal strategy relies on escalation—raising the stakes—as the only way to force the West to retreat and pressure Ukraine into a [[peace_negotiations_and_conflict_resolution | peace agreement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. However, this is unlikely to happen, as the West intends to increase its pressure on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

### Russia's Inability to Resist the West
Based on its combined power, Russia is seen as unable to withstand the pressure of the consolidated West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. Historically, Russia could only succeed by fighting one part of the West while relying on another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. The Soviet Union, being more powerful than modern Russia, was also ultimately doomed to defeat when confronting a unified West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

## Impending Crises and Historical Analogies
The military crisis will inevitably be accompanied by an [[russian_economic_issues_and_potential_crises | economic crisis]] and a financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>, along with a [[political_crisis_prediction_and_influence | political crisis]] and a crisis of Russian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. These are predicted to be the "darkest times" of Russian history in the 21st century, possibly comparable in scale to events from a century ago, such as the Crimean War (1853-1856), the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and the First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. While the Crimean War led to shameful defeat, it also stimulated positive changes for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Coping with Crisis
> Individuals are urged to prepare for this looming crisis, which the authorities are drawing them into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. Key [[strategies_to_cope_with_stress_and_crisis | strategies to cope with stress and crisis]] include:
> *   Helping each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.
> *   Taking care of oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.
> *   Maintaining health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
> *   Preserving normal family relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
> *   Exercising common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.

Despite the challenges, a firm belief in ultimate victory is expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

During a discussion about viewer questions on March 23, 2023, Valery Solovey addressed the outcomes of [[russian_delegation_visit_to_china | Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. He characterized the visit as successful and beneficial for China, but unsuccessful and disadvantageous for the Russian Federation, leading to disappointment for President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## China's Gains from the Agreements

China secured several significant economic advantages:
*   **Energy Supply** China obtained liquefied natural gas (LNG) at a substantial discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Russia also committed to building a new gas pipeline at its own expense, which will supply gas to China at a "colossal discount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This aligns with [[chinas_stance_on_russias_oil_export_and_military_strategy | China's stance on Russia's oil export strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   **Investment and Economic Requests** Russia agreed to all investment projects in which China expressed interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, and all of China's economic requests received consent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Currency Adoption** Russia, despite earlier public statements about only paying in rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, agreed to pay in yuan for trade with Latin America and Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This move is exclusively beneficial to China, as it expands the yuan's global appeal and deepens [[russiachina_relations_and_influence | Russia's ties to China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Russia's Returns and Disappointments

In return, the Russian Federation received "beautiful, high-flown, flowery oriental formulas" asserting that Russia and China are reliable partners working together to resist attempts to disrupt the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

A significant disappointment for President Putin was China's refusal to even promise to supply Russia with lethal military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. While China already supplies non-lethal goods for the armed forces and will continue to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, Russia is in urgent need of military equipment to repel an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive in the spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. China offered only "friendly reprimands," vaguely indicating a willingness to reconsider the issue in the summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This delay allows China to observe the results of the Ukrainian counteroffensive before risking worsened relations with the United States if Russian armament proves ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This is part of [[chinas_geopolitical_stance_and_its_impact_on_russia | China's geopolitical stance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Future Implications of Russia-China Dynamics

The outcome of the visit suggests that Russia is moving towards becoming a "vassal of China," with China acting as its "suzerain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This process is ongoing and far from complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

Regarding Russian domestic policy, the Chinese are indifferent to who holds the presidency—whether Putin, Dmitry Patrushev, or Mishustin—as long as Russia fulfills its obligations to China and maintains political stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. A meeting in an expanded format, including Prime Minister Mishustin, was seen as an "audition" for Mishustin, with Xi Jinping reportedly pleased with him and extending an invitation to visit China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

## Long-Term Leases

A [[secret_treaty_between_russia_and_china | secret treaty between Russia and China]], signed in 2022 and effective in 2025, grants China a 49-year lease on "gigantic territories" in the Russian Far East and Siberia, comparable in size to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. However, Solovey expresses confidence that this "anti-national" agreement will not be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

## Resistance to Chinese Influence

There is an expectation that future forces in Russia will aim for dialogue and interaction with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. It is believed they will have sufficient strength to resist [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics | China's influence]], especially as the West is interested in preventing Russia from fully aligning with China and is expected to provide assistance, including from the United States, Japan, and South Korea, particularly in the Asian Pacific region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

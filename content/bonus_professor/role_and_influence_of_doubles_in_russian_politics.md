The use of doubles, particularly concerning President Putin, is a recurring theme in discussions about [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_consolidation | Russian political dynamics]] and [[the_role_of_doubles_and_misinformation_in_russian_politics | misinformation]]. This practice extends beyond mere rumor, with claims of the Kremlin actively intending to use doubles for political staging and to influence public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Alleged Use of Putin's Doubles
It has been stated that there was no meeting between Putin, Prigozhin, and Wagner private military company commanders on June 29, 2023, contrary to the official statement from President Putin's press secretary, Peskov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Despite this, the Kremlin reportedly intended to produce fake photo and video documents depicting a staged meeting involving [[putins_doubles_theory | Putin's double]] and Wagner commanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The presence of doubles also comes into play regarding potential international engagements. For instance, discussions around a planned trip to Turkey raise the question of whether a double might be sent in Putin's stead, or if both Putin and a double could attend, appearing at different events to replace each other, e.g., Putin conducting negotiations while a double is shown in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

## Purpose and Impact of Using Doubles
The strategic deployment of doubles is seen as a method to achieve the "delegitimization of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. This process involves eroding trust in the authorities, which is considered the initial step towards dismantling the existing power structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The elite is reportedly well aware of Putin's extensive use of doubles, and the fact that the president no longer appears in public consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. The next phase of this delegitimization is anticipated within the broader Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## History and Intensification of Double Usage
Doubles reportedly began appearing in the second decade of the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Their use became more intensive after the 2014 Crimean events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. This intensification further accelerated from 2020, particularly when the decision was made to create doubles specifically to replace the current president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Future of Doubles
While it is suggested that doubles might temporarily replace Putin after his passing, it is asserted that they will not rule Russia in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This period of replacement is expected to be short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

Doubles were reportedly recruited with promises of having their original appearance restored through plastic surgery and receiving substantial financial compensation upon the completion of their "operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. However, there are serious doubts about whether these promises will actually be fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

The formation of the new Russian government in May 2024 has revealed intense [[political_dynamics_and_elite_struggles_in_russia | internal conflicts]] and power struggles within the Russian elite, characterized by a sharp increase in turbulence and a "rotten compromise" between powerful factions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:21">[01:18:21]</a>. These [[power_struggles_and_elite_coalitions_in_russia | conflicts]] are expected to intensify further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:57">[02:01:57]</a>.

## Key Coalitions and Candidates

The primary [[internal_politics_and_power_dynamics_in_russian_leadership | internal political dynamics]] are dominated by two main coalitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>:
*   **The Chemezov Coalition** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:56">[01:29:56]</a>
*   **The Patrushev Coalition** (headed by Nikolai Patrushev) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:46">[01:30:46]</a>

These coalitions have remained consistent in their influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:14">[01:33:14]</a>. The conflict between them, along with other elite groups, determines the main content of [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | domestic Russian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:15">[01:38:15]</a>.

Initially, in late November, there was an agreement that Dmitry Patrushev would become Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>. This would have led to a radical renewal of the government by 75-80% and positioned Dmitry Patrushev as the heir to the so-called "President Putin" (described as a double) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:03">[02:43:03]</a>.

By mid-February, the Patrushev coalition's plans faced strong, seemingly insurmountable resistance from the Chemezov coalition, which categorically opposed Dmitry Patrushev becoming Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. This created a "stalemate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:15">[04:19:15]</a>:
*   **Patrushev's candidate:** Dmitry Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:31">[04:25:31]</a>
*   **Chemezov's candidate:** Denis Manturov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:10">[04:29:10]</a>

Each group blocked the other's preferred candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:41">[04:32:41]</a>.

## Compromise Options and Mishustin's Appointment

Several compromise candidates were considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:02">[04:40:02]</a>:
*   **Anton Vaino:** Head of the Presidential Administration, who refused the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
*   **A security official** (as a second compromise candidate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:10">[05:32:10]</a>.
*   **Alexey Dyumin:** Appeared as a candidate in the last days, though briefly considered a compromise figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:24">[05:43:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:16">[05:46:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:27">[01:46:27]</a>.

### China's Influence

A significant factor in Mishustin's appointment was China's advocacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:16">[05:52:16]</a>. China's leadership, particularly Xi Jinping, personally liked Mishustin due to his solemn promise to fulfill all obligations towards China assumed by the "late President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:07">[06:05:07]</a>. China conditioned the visit of the "President Putin" double to Beijing in mid-May on Mishustin's appointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. This external dictate caused "very strong irritation" among the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:34">[01:17:34]</a>.

## The "Rotten Compromise"

The appointment of Mishustin as Prime Minister was the result of a "rotten compromise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>:
1.  **Vice-Premiers from both coalitions:** Denis Manturov (Chemezov coalition) became First Vice-Premier, and Dmitry Patrushev (Nikolai Patrushev's coalition) became a Vice-Premier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:40">[08:21:40]</a>. While Manturov's position in the socio-economic part of the government improved, Patrushev's worsened somewhat but not fundamentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.
2.  **Nikolai Patrushev's future:** Nikolai Patrushev was reportedly promised that Dmitry Patrushev would become the new Prime Minister by the end of 2024, with a potential transformation into president by early 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

This compromise is not considered long-term by any party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:06">[01:15:06]</a>.

### Patrushev "Goes into the Shadows"

As part of the compromise, Nikolai Patrushev "went into the shadows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>. This does not mean he retired from business but rather maintains control over the security forces without holding a prominent official position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that in [[internal_politics_and_power_dynamics_in_russian_leadership | Russian internal politics]], the person's real weight is more important than the official position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Sergei Shoigu's appointment as Security Council Secretary is considered an "absolute void" because Patrushev's first deputy, Nurgaliev, will manage affairs, and Patrushev himself will continue to lead the security forces from behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:15">[01:41:15]</a>. Patrushev managed to fully maintain his position within the security lobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## Current State and Future Predictions

The [[power_struggles_and_elite_coalitions_in_russia | two opposing coalitions]] (Chemezov and Patrushev) remain in force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:14">[01:53:14]</a>. The current [[internal_political_situation_in_russia | situation]] is an "unstable balance" between them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:49">[01:47:49]</a>.

The speaker predicts that the [[internal_political_developments_in_russia | turbulence]] will "intensify sharply" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>, leading to an inevitable discharge of tension between the coalitions, potentially involving bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

On March 4, Valery Soloviev, Doctor of Historical Sciences, political analyst, and public figure, discussed the rapidly developing situation in Russia and its [[impact_of_political_changes_in_russia | impact of political changes in Russia]] on society and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. He noted the dynamic situation requires constant adjustment in reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Information Control and Media Suppression

An "information iron curtain" is descending in Russia, with alternative media outlets ceasing to exist, with the exception of some bloggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Many media, including "Ural building sign" and "Silver Rain," have been forced to close or stop producing politically or socially significant news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This situation is compared to the Soviet Union, which had limited television channels and newspapers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

YouTube, a popular video hosting site in Russia, is also under threat of closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. While many users visit YouTube for entertainment or practical content rather than political news, its closure could affect a significant number of people who earn income from the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. YouTube has already ceased monetization and showing ads in the Russian Federation, drastically reducing income for creators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Soloviev suggests that authorities might be hesitant to close YouTube entirely due to its large, non-politicized audience, fearing their potential politicization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Legal Restrictions and Speech Control

A new "military centuries" law was adopted, making it unclear how to discuss events in Ukraine without phrases being potentially regarded as "empty" or information as "kopecks" (presumably, false or misleading) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. New amendments to the administrative code might prohibit even the term "anti-war movement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Therefore, alternative terms like "peace movement" or "peace-loving part of the public" are suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Military Campaign and its Aims

The ongoing military campaign in Ukraine, which Russian propaganda calls a "military special operation," aims to take cities like Kharkiv and Kyiv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. To achieve this, a strategy to "squeeze out the population" using open humanitarian corridors and building pressure is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The speaker draws a parallel to the experience of two Chechen campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The ultimate goal is to force a capitulation, or to remove the current Ukrainian leadership if they don't agree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. *The Times* newspaper reported three failed assassination attempts on Ukrainian President Zelenskyy within a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Potential for Mass Mobilization and Martial Law

There are spreading rumors about mass mobilization and the possible introduction of martial law, although Peskov, the Russian president's press secretary, denies these rumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Soloviev notes that Peskov previously denied military actions against Ukraine just weeks before they began, suggesting his statements should be treated with skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

Arguments for mobilization include:
*   The Pentagon's assessment that Russia has already deployed 90% of its assembled armed forces for the operation, with military tasks remaining unsolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   Mobilization could solve unemployment problems, such as the 5,000 workers affected by the closing of the Volkswagen plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. These individuals could be offered contracts in the army with decent pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   The possibility of expanding the scope of the "special operation" beyond Ukraine would necessitate a larger army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

The main factor against mobilization is the potential for mass [[public_opinion_and_its_impact_on_russian_political_dynamics | political discontent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. If mobilization occurs, especially on a significant scale (e.g., half a million people), it would likely be accompanied by the introduction of martial law, either full or partial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Elements of martial law, such as censorship, are already de facto introduced without legal justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Under martial law, military authorities could seize private property and equipment for their needs, massively violating private property rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

## Economic War and its Consequences

Pro-government sociological agencies like FOM and VTsIOM claim 70% support for the Kremlin's operation in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Soloviev doubts these figures, believing the situation is "far from being so rosy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The Kremlin interprets such support as a carte blanche for its actions, including potentially "gloomy" ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

The world is in a situation close to the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. Official Russian persons have stated that economic sanctions will be perceived as a declaration of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The West is openly waging an economic war against the Russian Federation, inflicting severe blows on the [[impact_of_the_war_on_russian_society_and_economy | Russian economy and Russian society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. The Russian ruble is in decline, and the Russian economy is very weak and highly dependent on external relations, especially with Europe and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

If economic pressure from the West increases as military operations continue, it will have dangerous [[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | sociopolitical changes in Russia]] with potentially very serious consequences, including the possibility of mass protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

## Nuclear Blackmail

The Kremlin believes that threatening with nuclear weapons, including demonstrating tactical nuclear weapons on a limited scale, is an excellent way to achieve significant concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This strategy is seen as a way to achieve concessions if the ultimatum presented to NATO in December last year is not fully implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

> "They will all die, and we will go to heaven." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>

Soloviev expresses concern that the ruling group of the Russian elite is ready to send the population "to heaven" but has first-class shelters for themselves, unlike ordinary citizens who might only have metro stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. American partners are taking the threat of nuclear strikes extremely seriously, even cancelling training firing of intercontinental ballistic missiles to avoid provocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. A recent closed briefing in the US Congress by intelligence services discussed the mental state of the Russian president, which Soloviev suggests could answer questions about the military operation and the possibility of nuclear weapons use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

## Call to Action and Future Outlook

Soloviev challenges those who remain "outside of politics" or support current policies to consider the personal consequences:
*   Sons, husbands, and fathers potentially being mobilized for military action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.
*   Shortages of vital medications in pharmacies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
*   Inability to access medical services like MRI due to technical impossibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.
*   Difficulty in buying even the simplest food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
He states that these consequences are a result of their own actions and choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>.

For those who desire peace, Soloviev warns against believing they are in a minority, calling it a propaganda trick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. He predicts that "in just a few months," peace advocates will be the majority because "life is better than any explanations" and "changes even the most stubborn, deluded, and stubborn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

Soloviev urges people to strengthen "horizontal connections" and help each other, as "you can't get out of hell alone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of conveying a "clear voice of common sense, human dignity, and moral sobriety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Valery Soloviev's personal request
> Due to monetization being impossible in the Russian Federation, Soloviev asks for financial support through likes, reposts, sharing his activities, and material donations, noting that a significant portion of aid goes to public and charitable needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

Despite the expectation of even harder times, Soloviev concludes with the Latin proverb "dum spiro spero" (while I breathe, I hope), expressing confidence that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

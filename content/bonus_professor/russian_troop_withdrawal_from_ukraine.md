The withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine is anticipated to occur upon the signing of a [[proposal_for_peace_deal_between_russia_and_ukraine | Peace Agreement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. There is a hope that this withdrawal could commence earlier as a gesture of goodwill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Impact of [[end_of_military_actions_in_ukraine | Ending Military Actions]]

If [[end_of_military_actions_in_ukraine | military actions]] are no longer financed, Russia would possess sufficient funds for various internal needs, rather than experiencing extensive corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. This cessation of military financing could effectively create a "second or even a third budget" for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:02">[00:38:02]</a>.

## Societal Aftermath of the Conflict

The end of the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | armed conflict]] is expected to bring challenges, as society may be "inundated with a stream of heroes and participants" who have been involved in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:09">[00:40:09]</a>. Many of these individuals, described as "former and recently become such criminals," may return still armed and with "a bouquet of mental problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.

The current governing body (Politburo 2.0) is not perceived to be actively addressing this anticipated problem, despite warnings from analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.

### Proposed Solutions for Returning Personnel
A plan exists to address the reintegration of individuals with PTSD or other mental health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>. This includes:
*   Registering people with PTSD for psychiatric or special registration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>.
*   Providing special medications to enable them to live within society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.

This approach is based on the experiences of other countries that have undergone similar conflicts, as well as Russia's own experiences from conflicts like the War in Afghanistan and the two Chechen Wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. The aim is to prevent a constant source of conflict and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>.

This article summarizes observations regarding the [[political_and_economic_climate_in_Russia | Russian political and economic climate]], its current state, and future predictions, based on recent discussions.

## Current State of [[The sustainability of the Russian economy | Russian Economy]]

The speaker notes that the [[State of the Russian economy | Russian economy]] and social system have managed to adapt to sanctions over time, comparing it to a frog being cooked gradually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. However, it is now believed that the "frog" is beginning to die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

Key factors contributing to the system's previous survivability include:
*   **Gradual Sanctions:** Sanctions were imposed gradually, allowing time for adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Initially, they were not fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Safety Margin:** The [[Russian financial system status and predictions | Russian economy]] had a much higher unaccounted-for safety margin than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   **Public Patience:** The patience of the [[Russian societal concerns and priorities | Russian people]] has historically helped authorities overcome problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. This patience is now nearing exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

The financial and banking system is described as being in a "catastrophic" state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>.

## Economic Outlook and Predictions

### Deposit Freezing and Denomination
Freezing deposits and accounts is considered an uncontested and "only alternative" solution for the [[economic_and_political_situation_in_Russia | Russian economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>. This action is expected to happen around spring or summer of next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. The conditions of the freeze might be softened, but the event itself is likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.

*   **Purpose:** To "fill the economic vessels with money blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a>.
*   **Impact on Accounts:** Brokerage accounts are also expected to be frozen, at least temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>. Pensions and salaries will still be received on cards, but withdrawals and usage will be subject to new limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>.
*   **Real Estate Market:** The real estate market is predicted to face a "very serious crisis" and stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:39:00">[31:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:07:00">[48:07:00]</a>.
*   **Dollar Deposits:** Dollar deposits will not be exempt from freezing and might be automatically converted to rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:33:00">[44:33:00]</a>.
*   **Denomination:** Denomination of the ruble is not expected to happen simultaneously with the deposit freeze but months or even a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>. There is currently no reason to exchange large banknotes for smaller ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:27:00">[17:27:00]</a>.

### Sanctions and Economic Recovery
The lifting or easing of sanctions is expected to have a positive impact on the [[Russian economy | Russian economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:33:00">[41:33:00]</a>. However, this will not happen instantly; the process is expected to take months or even years, even after a truce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:19:00">[42:19:00]</a>.

## [[Russian Internal Politics and Economy | Political Climate]] and Transition

### The "Transit Plan"
The approval process for the "transit plan," involving specific names, dates, and surnames, has not yet been completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This plan addresses the struggle for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

### Elite Dynamics and Power Shift
Elite discontent is significant, stemming not only from military actions but also from fundamental differences regarding Russia's future development and ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. Existing contradictions within the "Putin model" are irreconcilable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

*   **Hawks' Influence:** The "Hawks" sought to extend their "Carte Blanche" until January 20, but consent was not granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   **Military Course Shift:** There is "serious hope" that after December 15, the military course of the Russian Federation will gradually shift towards finding a peaceful solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Cautious steps in this direction are already being taken, including at the fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.
*   **Politburo 2.0:** Consensus decisions are made within the Politburo 2.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. Chemezov's group is reportedly superior to Patrushev's group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:53:00">[17:53:00]</a> and has prevented general mobilization and the use of tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>.
*   **Role of the People:** Revolutionary potential of the masses is considered a secondary, rather than primary, factor in driving change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. Experts do not place main hopes on the people "waking up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

### New Government's Actions
Upon a change of power, the new government plans to:
*   **Legal Reform:** Radically revise the Criminal Code, which currently has disproportionately soft punishments for violent crimes and harsh terms for minor offenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   **Judicial System:** Implement a "complete, total lustration of the judicial corps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.
*   **Political Prisoners:** Release all political prisoners and innocently convicted individuals, including those not necessarily under political articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>. These individuals will receive full rehabilitation, including financial compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. A special agency will be created to restore violated constitutional rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.
*   **Propagandists:** Propagandists will be held criminally responsible for their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>, with the speaker suggesting they face "Basmanny justice" rather than an international tribunal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.
*   **Informers:** Names, surnames, and patronymics of all informers will be publicly released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:53:00">[32:53:00]</a>, and they will be legally compelled to compensate for material losses caused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:53:00">[34:53:00]</a>.
*   **State Television:** Television will not disappear but its "vector of activity" and "propaganda" will change by 180 degrees, beginning to tell the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:54:00">[35:54:00]</a>.
*   **Returning Citizens:** The overwhelming majority of people who left Russia due to military action and the Putin regime are expected to return to a "New Russia" that provides opportunities they lacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:12:00">[38:12:00]</a>.

### Historical Comparisons and Unique Aspects
While some similarities can be drawn between the current situation and past [[political crisis and economic implications in Russia | Russian periods of turmoil]] like the Time of Troubles (1905-1917) and palace coups, the current situation is considered significantly different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:29:00">[26:29:00]</a>.

*   **The "Double" Story:** The current situation is unique due to the "story with a double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:16:00">[27:16:00]</a>, allowing for the successful deception of society, similar to the False Dmitrys in the Time of Troubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:28:00">[27:28:00]</a>.
*   **Positive Elite Dynamics:** For the first time in Russia's history, the intra-elite dynamics have a chance to direct the country in a positive direction, acting in the interests of society and the country, rather than just one group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:28:00">[28:28:00]</a>.

### Signs of Progress and Recovery
Visible progress in social, health, and education spheres, and overall recovery, will be marked by:
*   The release of political prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02:00">[29:02:00]</a>.
*   The cessation of blocking or slowing down YouTube and other "hostile" social networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:05:00">[29:05:00]</a>.
*   Changes in the general atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:16:00">[29:16:00]</a>.

However, immediate improvements in economic and social terms are not expected due to "colossal inertia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:35:00">[29:35:00]</a>. The first signs of economic recovery are anticipated around the turn of the next year, and a full recovery from the crisis is expected to take at least two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:06:00">[30:06:00]</a>.

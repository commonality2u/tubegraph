On the night of May 2-3, 2023, the Moscow Kremlin was reportedly attacked by drones of unknown origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. While the drones' origin is widely believed to be Ukrainian, and the Kremlin's public acknowledgment of the incident suggests that "things are not going very well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This [[possibility_and_implications_of_strikes_on_russian_territory | attack on Russian territory]] has significant [[geopolitical_consequences_and_crisis_predictions_in_russia | geopolitical consequences]] and has intensified the atmosphere of tension and anxiety in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## The Drone Attack
The drones that attacked the Kremlin are considered to be 99.99% Ukrainian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The attack was symbolic rather than military or political <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, as President Putin is "practically never in the Kremlin" and prefers to spend his time in deep bunkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The intention was not to target the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> or "behead Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Instead, the goal was to show that the Kremlin is vulnerable and accessible, and that "the Russian flag has fallen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. At least one of the two drones was shot down near the Senate building, where the state flag flies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This event occurred on the eve of a Ukrainian offensive, adding to its symbolic weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Escalating Tensions and Public Mood
The drone attack on the Kremlin is part of a broader escalation of events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, which include:
*   Sabotage on railway transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   The FSB's announcement of a thwarted assassination attempt on the head of the Republic of Crimea, Aksyonov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   Regular drone attacks not only on frontline areas but increasingly on the Russian capital and Moscow region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

These events have contributed to an "intensive and increasingly tense hysterical atmosphere" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. While the establishment exhibits strong nervousness and tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, some segments of Russian society, particularly in Moscow and the Moscow region, have developed a "mania for searching and detecting Ukrainian drones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This has led to up to 100 calls a day reporting drone sightings, most of which are considered "absolute nonsense" and driven by public fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

In response to this paranoia, Moscow authorities ordered public utilities to monitor the airspace of the Russian capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Additionally, as of May 3, the Moscow mayor banned all drone launches except for "competent ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The speaker notes that the Ukrainian offensive has already begun in an informational, propaganda, and moral-psychological sense, creating an atmosphere of "anxious expectation and expectation of something bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## Official Reactions and Martial Law Considerations
Following the attack, Security Council Secretary Patrushev demanded that President Putin immediately impose martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Martial law is already in effect in Russia's "new territories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, and Patrushev sought its extension to the capital, frontline regions, and possibly other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

Putin, who avoids hasty decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, postponed the decision on martial law until the end of the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. It is speculated that no decision will be made before May 9, as authorities aim to hold the Victory Day parade, albeit without an air component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Putin is also hesitant because the introduction of martial law would diminish his power in favor of the security officers who would control its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Amendments were introduced on May 3 to the Federal Constitutional Law on martial law to allow elections in the "new regions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, though the speaker doubts these regional elections will be held at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The overall [[potential_political_and_military_actions_involving_russia | military-political dynamics]] and their internal impact on the Russian Federation will heavily influence these decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications of Martial Law
The [[potential_consequences_of_putin_accepting_or_rejecting_the_ultimatum | introduction of martial law]] would entail significant restrictions:
*   **Civil Rights and Freedoms:** A primary restriction would be on civil rights and freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Travel Restrictions:** Those subject to military service (over 15 million people currently) could face a ban on travel outside the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Internal Movement:** Restrictions on movement between regions could also be introduced, alongside strengthened passport control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Freedom of Speech:** There would naturally be a restriction of freedom of speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Internment:** The possibility of internment (detention without trial or investigation for up to 30 days, extendable) would arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Conscription:** Martial law elements would facilitate conscription, with formal restrictions potentially ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Mass checks of those subject to conscription are reportedly already starting in some cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Financial Restrictions:** Theoretically, bank cards and accounts of those potentially liable for military service could be blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. The Central Bank and Nabiullina reportedly prepared for this in September 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

It is noted that elements of martial law could be implemented without a formal declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

## Local Authority Response
The scope of restrictions implemented under martial law would vary by region and city, depending heavily on the position of local authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Moscow Mayor Sobyanin is expected to try and protect his voters and maintain their loyalty to him, possibly with some success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

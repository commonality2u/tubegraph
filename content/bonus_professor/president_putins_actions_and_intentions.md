Valery Solovey, in the 47th episode of "What's Happening", recorded on January 8th and aired on January 9th, discusses the strategic situation the Russian Federation finds itself in, particularly focusing on the role of [[President Putins address to Russians | President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. Solovey notes that [[President Putins address to Russians | Putin]] himself created this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## Russia's Strategic Trap

Solovey had previously stated there was a great risk that Russia would fall into a strategic trap, a thesis he repeated several times in the spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. He now expands on this concept, defining a "strategic trap" by two main features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>:
1.  **Fundamental Inability to Achieve Goals**
    *   One party to a conflict is fundamentally unable to achieve its military-political goals by military means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
2.  **Continued Escalation Despite Inability**
    *   Despite this fundamental inability, the party continues to increase efforts to achieve these goals, which are often obviously unattainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

Solovey provides historical examples of strategic traps involving superpowers: the United States in Vietnam (1965-1973) and Afghanistan (2001-2021), and the Soviet Union in Afghanistan (1979-1989) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. He asserts that modern Russia is now in a strategic trap in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. These previous traps were long in duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a> and ended with withdrawal and political defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, not necessarily military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. In these situations, colossal resources were ineptly wasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>, leading to belated political decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

### Reasons for Falling into Strategic Traps

Countries, or even corporations, fall into strategic traps for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>:
*   **Overestimation of Own Power**: A party overestimates its own economic and military strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   **Underestimation of Enemy Strength**: A party underestimates the enemy's strength, including military power and the ability of civilians to act as a permanent reservoir of resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.
*   **Misunderstanding of Theater of Operations**: The party holding the initiative does not understand the significance of the specifics of the military operations theater (e.g., jungle in Vietnam, mountainous terrain in Afghanistan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
*   **Error in Assessing Strategic Context**: Underestimation or error in assessing the strategic context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. This includes external support provided to the opposing side, such as the Soviet Union and China assisting North Vietnam, the West aiding Afghanistan against the Soviets, and the West currently providing assistance to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. Russian propaganda reasonably notes that the West is against Russia, primarily as a supplier of equipment, intelligence, and in some cases, manpower (Western PMCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. However, it's not a full confrontation between the [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_stances_of_kremlin | Russian Federation and NATO]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

### Why Countries Remain in Traps

Despite predictions warning against remaining in such dangerous situations, countries stick in them due to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>:
1.  **Arrogance of Power**: The hope that the difference in economic and military potential will eventually favor the side with greater potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. This "arrogance of power" is characteristic of superpowers like the US (in Vietnam and Afghanistan), the Soviet Union (in Afghanistan), and applies confidently to the [[Russian military actions in Ukraine | Russian Federation's actions in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.
2.  **Cognitive Delusion**: This is characteristic not only of ordinary people but also of military-political leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. It's like a casino player constantly increasing stakes to recoup losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. Solovey draws an analogy to McNamara's proposals to increase US military presence in Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>, Soviet behavior in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>, and current [[Russian military actions in Ukraine | Russian armed forces' behavior in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>, including the "Energy war" against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.
3.  **Distorting Properties of Religion/Ideology**: While not typical for the US or Soviet Union regarding religion, the obscuring properties of ideology had an effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. The Iran-Iraq war is cited as an example of religion's influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.

Solovey emphasizes that while everyone is subject to cognitive delusions, only countries with colossal economic and military potential—superpowers like the US or Soviet Union—can afford to persist in such delusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>. Smaller, less resourced countries are quickly forced to abandon conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>. Democratic systems also react faster to resource depletion due to criticism and competition, unlike authoritarian leaders who fear losing political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>.

## Putin's Intentions and Strategy

Solovey asserts that there is no conspiracy theory behind the strategic trap; political leaders willingly enter such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>. Once deeply stuck, opponents will wage a war of attrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. The West is increasing aid to Ukraine because it's a "wonderful opportunity" to deliver a decisive blow to the military power of the [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_stances_of_kremlin | Russian Federation]] and discourage its future use of military force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:32:00">[14:32:00]</a>. Solovey directly states that this opportunity was personally provided by [[President Putins address to Russians | President Vladimir Putin]] himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.

Russia is not a superpower like the Soviet Union was, especially when considering GDP ratios (Russia 1.7%, US 23%, EU 17%, plus Japan and South Korea not on Russia's side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. This indicates an "incomparability" of economic and military potentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>. Therefore, victory is no longer possible for Russia; the discussion should be about conditions for an "honorable withdrawal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:44:00">[17:44:00]</a>. The Russian government "blew this chance" in March last year when ideal conditions existed for leaving Ukraine, declaring themselves winners, and with the Ukrainian leadership ready to make concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:51:00">[17:51:00]</a>. Now, neither the Ukrainian leadership nor society will make concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>.

### Putin's Escalation and Goals

The situation for the [[assessment_of_vladimir_putins_presidency_and_its_impact | Russian Federation]] and its leadership is deemed "extremely important" and will worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00">[18:24:00]</a>. To achieve an "honorable exit" that could be presented as a victory, [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin]] is "ready to do anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>. He has two resources:
1.  **Nuclear Tactical Weapons**: Considered the "last argument of kings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>.
2.  **Manpower**: Believing that Russia's human potential significantly exceeds Ukraine's, [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin]] intends to "throw the people into the furnace of confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:58:00">[18:58:00]</a>.

Solovey states that the [[assessment_of_vladimir_putins_presidency_and_its_impact | Russian president]] is ready to sacrifice his own people to preserve his power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>, considering losses of up to half a million people acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. This is attributed to authoritarian leaders' fear of losing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>.

The ultimate conclusion is that the goals of the "special operation" are no longer outside Russia, but "inside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:00">[20:44:00]</a>. The main goal for [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin]] is to preserve his own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:50:00">[20:50:00]</a>. However, Solovey notes a paradox: every day, [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin]] weakens his own power, as those around him and in Russian society understand that "something is wrong" and that they are in a "trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>.

Solovey concludes with a quote attributed to Miyamoto Musashi: "immature strategy - the reason for sadness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:00">[22:10:00]</a>, which he applies to the [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_stances_of_kremlin | Russian government]], predicting increasing sadness for the country and its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:16:00">[22:16:00]</a>.

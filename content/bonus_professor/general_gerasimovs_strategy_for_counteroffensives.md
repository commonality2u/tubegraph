The winter offensive by the Russian army, also referred to as the "grand offensive" of the Russian armed forces on the Ukrainian fronts, has concluded in an "inglorious end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This assessment is shared by various experts, including Igor Strelkov, who stated that the winter campaign ended "without result" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, necessitating a wait for the enemy's next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## "Imitation" Offensive and its Purpose

There are indications that the "grand offensive" was largely an "imitation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This imitation was designed to influence the mood of the supreme commander-in-chief, demonstrating perceived forward movement even if only by negligible gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The true purpose of this imitation was to buy time for [[general_gerasimovs_appointment_and_military_strategy | General Gerasimov]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

[[general_gerasimovs_appointment_and_military_strategy | General Gerasimov]], described as a highly intellectual and excellent planner, understands that the opposing side is preparing for a [[ukraines_potential_offensive_and_its_implications | counteroffensive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. While the Ukrainians have discussed their offensive, specific timings and directions are not to be trusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. However, the general assumption that a [[ukraines_potential_offensive_and_its_implications | counteroffensive]] will occur in the near future is well-founded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## [[counterstrategies_for_Ukraine | Gerasimov's Defensive Strategy]]

To repel the anticipated [[ukraines_potential_offensive_and_its_implications | Ukrainian offensive]], [[general_gerasimovs_appointment_and_military_strategy | General Gerasimov]] is implementing a multi-faceted [[counterstrategies_for_Ukraine | strategy]]:

*   **Building a Line of Defense:** A robust line of defense, previously known as the Surovikino line, is being constructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. It is expected to be renamed the [[general_gerasimovs_appointment_and_military_strategy | Gerasimov]] line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. A significant portion of mobilized personnel are engaged in digging trenches and establishing this defensive line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. The expectation is that the Ukrainians will incur heavy losses against this line and be forced to retreat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Preserving Resources:** To effectively hold the line, it is crucial to preserve remaining equipment and accumulate a stock of shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. There have been reports of shell shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Professional Army:** Preserving the remnants of the professional army is also a key objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

The "imitation offensive" served the purpose of allowing time for these preparations without signaling [[russian_military_tactics_in_Ukraine | Russia's]] true defensive posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. The winter campaign has ended, and the Russian side is now preparing for the [[ukraines_potential_offensive_and_its_implications | Ukrainian counteroffensive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The long-term goal for the Russian side, from this transactional position, is to initiate negotiations when neither side can inflict a decisive defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

Russia is currently facing significant [[economic_and_financial_challenges_in_russia | economic challenges]] and is preparing for an [[economic_crisis | economic crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Economic Outlook

While some indicators suggest a recovery, the overall picture points towards a looming crisis:
*   **Imports and Exports**: Bloomberg reported that Russian imports returned to 2020 levels, indicating pre-war indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Bloomberg, considered a highly authoritative economic agency, also calculates that Russia has restored its exports to pre-war levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Consumer Behavior**: Despite the export and import data, retail sales in Russia have consistently declined for ten consecutive months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. By the end of last year, real retail sales had fallen by 10.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. This trend suggests the population is becoming poorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

## Impact on Households

Most Russians are living from paycheck to paycheck or pension to pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Instead of borrowing from friends or neighbors, people are now relying on microloans to get by until payday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. There is a widespread belief among the populace that conditions will worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. This consumer behavior, characterized by people saving money (those who have it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> and preparing for the worst, signals that an [[economic_crisis | economic crisis]] is almost inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

## Military Spending

Russia's spending on the special military operation is estimated by Bloomberg and other Western agencies to be between $300 million and $400 million per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This "gigantic money" is spent daily on killing people and destroying cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

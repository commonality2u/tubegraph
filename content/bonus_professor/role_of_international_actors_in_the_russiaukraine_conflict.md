International actors have played a significant role in the ongoing [[Russia Ukraine conflict]], particularly concerning peace proposals and military assistance.

## Peace Proposals and Negotiations
Following the withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson, a peace proposal was immediately received by the Russian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This proposal, whose outline was agreed upon by [[Ukraine]] and then transferred to the Russian Federation, is considered serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

Key points of the proposed global agreements include:
*   Russia's complete withdrawal from [[Ukraine]]'s territory, including the DPR and LPR, but excluding Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   Crimea would receive an indefinite status for seven years, during which negotiations would occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Crimea would be demilitarized, and the Black Sea Fleet would leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   A 100-kilometer deep demilitarized zone would be established along the borders of Russia and Belarus with [[Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   In return, [[Ukraine]] would pledge not to join NATO for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   The Russian military base in Transnistria would be relocated to Russia, and Russia would not interfere with Transnistria's integration into Moldova in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   A crucial element for the Russian establishment's potential acceptance is the guarantee that Russian military, political, and civilian personnel would not be subject to punishment, ensuring their freedom, security, and the preservation of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Indicators of Russian Leadership's Seriousness
Indirect signs suggest the Russian leadership took the proposal seriously:
*   Plans for the use of tactical nuclear weapons were curtailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   Turkish President Erdogan announced efforts to meet with Putin and then Zelensky to discuss a peace agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   A potential third sign would be Russia abandoning massive strikes on [[Ukraine]]'s energy infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

While the Kremlin may be considering these proposals, it might also seek to gain time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. The issue of financial compensation or reparations for [[Ukraine]]'s damage was not mentioned in the received materials but should be discussed during negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

## International Military Assistance to Ukraine
[[Ukraine]]'s military capabilities are critically dependent on American aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. Any decrease or cessation of this aid would lead to a corresponding reduction in [[Ukraine]]'s military strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

### American Position
The American position on the [[Ukraine Russia conflict analysis | conflict]] is pragmatic:
*   The U.S. aims to inflict a military defeat on Russia on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   This defeat can be achieved through [[Ukraines military strategy and international support | Ukraine's military actions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
*   However, there is no intention to directly change Russia's political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. The U.S. believes such change should occur naturally, fearing negative consequences if it directly intervenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

[[Ukraine]] can influence the [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | international relations and military actions concerning Ukraine]] through its military successes, but it cannot influence internal political changes within Russia; these must be driven by Russian citizens themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

Russia is reportedly preparing for a new stage of [[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization | mobilization]] amidst ongoing military dynamics and economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. These preparations suggest an expectation of long-term confrontation with Ukraine or even the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## Official Stance and Counter-Narratives

Despite rumors of [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]], presidential press secretary Peskov has officially refuted them, labeling them as "sabotage and provocations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. However, it is suggested that the current authorities themselves are responsible for spreading these rumors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Recent Amendments and Hidden Mobilization

Recent governmental actions point towards a "hidden form of [[mobilization_and_military_policies_in_russia | mobilization]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>:
*   The deferment from [[mobilization_and_military_policies_in_russia | mobilization]] for fathers of many children has been canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   There is information about increasing the upper limit of conscription for military service to 30 years old, effective as early as Spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This change would allow for the call-up of conscripts from 21 to 30 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Proposed Changes to Military Service Length

The issue of increasing the length of military service to two years is currently under discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This proposal is highly likely to be resolved positively, potentially by the Fall draft of this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

## Anticipated Scale of Mobilization

According to reports from The Times, referencing MI6, Russia is preparing to implement a second stage of [[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This stage is expected to be phased into several parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. The first part, or "first wave," is projected to [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilize]] up to half a million people, with the total number potentially reaching up to 2 million individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Economic Implications

The financing of extensive [[general_mobilization_readiness_in_russia | mobilization]], ongoing military operations, and increased military service terms will largely depend on the state budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Russia's primary source of foreign exchange is oil and gas exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

Recent economic indicators show challenges:
*   Russian Urals oil, which accounts for two-thirds of the country's oil exports, fell below $40 per barrel (specifically $38.7 per barrel) at the end of the previous week, marking a record low since summer 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   This decline is leading to decreasing export revenues, posing serious problems for the budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   With a price ceiling introduced from February 5, Russia may lose between $100 billion to $180 billion in foreign exchange earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

To compensate for these losses, social and economic development expenses are expected to be significantly cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. The armed forces and security agencies (Russian Guard, police, FSB, Federal Protective Service) will continue to receive maximum financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Russia is also attempting to increase oil exports to offset losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, with January oil exports sharply increasing by one and a half times compared to December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

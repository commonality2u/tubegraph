The primary concerns and priorities of Russian society, as observed in April 2023, center overwhelmingly on internal economic well-being rather than external conflicts or political freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Key Concerns

A poll from the Levada Center (conducted in March 2023) identified the leading worries among Russian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>:

*   **Rising Prices** Rising prices are the top concern for 58% of Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Many Russians prioritize economic stability, expressing a sentiment of "Let them fight if only prices do not rise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This highlights [[economic_concerns_of_russian_citizens | economic concerns of Russian citizens]].
*   **Armed Confrontation/Special Military Operation** Concerns about the special military operation in Ukraine, the conflict with the West, and sanctions rank second, worrying 33% of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. However, the gap between this and rising prices is "colossal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>, indicating that external military and political issues are less pressing for most citizens than internal economic ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

## Economic Hardship

Further polling reveals significant economic hardship across Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>:
*   Approximately one in six citizens (around 16%) lack sufficient funds for food and clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   4% do not have enough money even for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   13% can afford food but struggle to buy clothes or shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

### Support Amidst Hardship
Paradoxically, the demographic group experiencing the worst economic conditions, pensioners (over 60 years old), shows the highest support for the [[Russian internal political dynamics and leadership issues | Russian president's policies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Despite 27% of this group complaining about not having enough money for food or clothing, they remain a "key basis of support" for the current administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## Low Concern for Civil Liberties

In stark contrast to economic issues, concerns about human rights, mass violations, and the suppression of civil rights and freedoms worry only 4% of Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. This places such concerns in "last place" on the list of societal worries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This 4% roughly corresponds to the audience size of pro-liberal media outlets broadcasting to a Russian audience from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

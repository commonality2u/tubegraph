Russian oligarchs and big business are described as being deeply involved in the "dirty political" affairs of the Kremlin, both politically and otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>.

## Recent Developments and Calls for Sanctions

Following proposals by [[Alexei Navalny | Alexei Navalny]] to introduce sanctions against oligarchs believed to support the Kremlin, the "General SVR" channel plans to release materials specifically on these individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

## Specific Oligarchs Mentioned

The discussion highlights the involvement of several prominent figures:
*   **Vladimir Potanin** A recent post by General SVR was dedicated to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:14">[00:47:14]</a>.
*   **Alisher Usmanov** He was previously hinted to have an "extremely unseemly role in the case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>. It is also stated that Usmanov is "responsible for drug trafficking in Europe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>.

### General SVR Telegram Channel

The "General SVR" Telegram channel is reportedly run by several high-ranking officers from various Russian special services, including both retired and active personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The speaker confirms knowing at least one of these individuals, who participated in a program with Evgenia Albats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Evgenia Albats is noted for taking the information provided by "General SVR" quite seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The speaker asserts that the person is indeed a General, not a "Ukrainian lawyer" or "SMM-shchika" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, and has known this individual for a long time, having verified the quality and reliability of their information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

The "General SVR" Telegram channel has entered the top 100 global Telegram channels in terms of coverage per post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Initially at 99th place, it moved to 85th place within two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. For a channel with less than five months of history, these are considered "colossal achievements" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Regarding a sharp reaction from individuals like Aleksey Venediktov, editor-in-chief of Echo of Moscow, the speaker suggests it was a defensive move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. If Venediktov received a call expressing "extreme dissatisfaction" with "General SVR" appearing on Echo of Moscow, he would need to distance himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Venediktov's tweet about drinking whiskey with a "real General SVR," Yuri Kobaladze, who retired in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, is seen as an attempt to discredit the anonymous source, as Kobaladze would not be privy to current service information after 21 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Intelligence Leaks and Sensitive Information

Leaks of sensitive information from the Kremlin have "sharply increased" in the last two months prior to the recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. These leaks are not attributed to top officials but to those "in the shadow of these top officials" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>. These individuals are reportedly considering their future after [[security_and_risk_concerns_for_putin | Vladimir Putin]] leaves power and how they will "justify themselves in the West" and "negotiate with the West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>. They would prefer to receive security guarantees from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.

The current level of leaks is described as "unprecedented" over 20 years, comparable only to what happened in the Soviet Union after August 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

### Role of General SVR in Clarifying Information

The "General SVR" Telegram channel plays a "colossal" role in clarifying the background of events, such as terrorist attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>. The speaker notes that this channel is read by "almost everyone" in the Kremlin, including propagandists, and by "all Western intelligence services" and "new Eastern ones too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a>. The information provided by the channel is taken "absolutely seriously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

When asked if the [[russian_federal_security_service_revelations | FSB was involved in the Magnitogorsk terrorist attack]] and the Kogalymavia plane explosion, the speaker stated that, to their knowledge, this information from the General SVR is true and confirmed by other sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. Evgenia Albats is also suggested as someone who could confirm this information, being "quite well informed in this sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.

The speaker notes that some methods of influencing society, such as new terrorist attacks, "cannot be repeated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. The role of the "General SVR" Telegram channel in clarifying the background of such attacks is significant, and the Kremlin is aware of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:24">[01:00:24]</a>. The society is generally already aware of this information as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

### Personal Connections and Relationships

The speaker confirms a very close and long-standing acquaintance with the "General SVR," describing their relationship as "very close" and even "friends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:21">[01:19:21]</a>. However, the speaker denies being connected with any intelligence service of any country, stating their relationships with intelligence and counterintelligence officers are purely personal and friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:18">[00:43:18]</a>. They also state that no recruiting approaches have been made towards them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.

### Future Predictions and Concerns

The speaker states that it is unlikely [[security_and_risk_concerns_for_putin | Vladimir Putin]] will remain in power next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:08">[01:23:08]</a>. This belief is not solely based on the speaker's opinion, but also on information from "much more knowledgeable institutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:32">[01:14:32]</a>. This aligns with the idea of the count of [[internal_political_strategies_and_succession_rumors_in_Russia | Putin's remaining time]] going on for months, not decades or years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

It is also noted that the question of how long [[internal_political_strategies_and_succession_rumors_in_Russia | Putin's double]] could rule in case of the president's incapacity is considered, with the belief that it would be "extremely short-lived" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. Doubles were primarily used for security purposes or at public events where the president did not need to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>.

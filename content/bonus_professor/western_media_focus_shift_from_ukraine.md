The global media's focus has notably shifted away from the [[Ukraine Russia conflict | conflict in Ukraine]] following the Hamas attack in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This shift began around October 6-7, leading major Western and global media outlets to curtail their online coverage of military actions in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Decline in Ukraine Coverage
Prominent news organizations such as The New York Times and CNN have reduced their live feeds of short news related to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. An example cited is the BBC news hour on a Saturday morning, which reportedly contained "not a word about Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

This phenomenon is explained by the maxim: "where attention is directed, there energy appears." If there is no attention, there is no energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. It is currently difficult to foresee conditions under which Ukraine would return to the long-term focus of global media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This matters significantly because global media play a crucial role in formulating the global information agenda, determining what is at the center of societies' attention and what is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Impact on Aid to Ukraine
While financial resources are still ample to support both Israel and Ukraine simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, the situation regarding aid with weapons and ammunition presents a challenge of choosing priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Israel is expected to be the priority in this selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

Experts and Western media reports suggest that the peak of Western aid to Ukraine was reached in the summer and early autumn of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This aid is now expected to decrease due to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>:
1.  **Emergence of a new theater of military operations in the Middle East** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, impacting the [[Impact of Middle East war on RussianUkrainian conflict | Russian-Ukrainian conflict]] and international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
2.  **The Ukrainian offensive's inability to achieve its strategic goals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. While there were positional successes, strategic objectives were not met and are unlikely to be achieved this season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. The summer-autumn offensive campaign is considered to be in its final phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
    *   Future Ukrainian offensives depend on sufficient weapons, ammunition, successful mobilization, and political support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Stalemate in the [[Ukraine Russia conflict | Ukraine-Russia Conflict]]
The most probable current outcome of the summer-autumn campaigns is the transition of both parties to mutual strategic defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This situation is characterized by Western experts as a stalemate or a "strategic dead end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. While the military situation is unpredictable, a stalemate is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

This strategic dead end is unlikely to benefit the Ukrainian side, but the Russian leadership may be satisfied with it, as it preserves the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

## Russia's Alleged Role in Hamas Attack
The speaker concludes that Russia was involved, directly or indirectly, in the Hamas actions against Israel, likely operating "under a foreign flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This involvement is detailed in three aspects:
1.  **Assistance with Sensitive Information and Planning:** Russia provided aid in supplying Hamas with sensitive information and planning the operation, although the extent of this assistance is considered unlikely to be significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
2.  **Training by Wagner PMC:** Instructors from the Wagner Private Military Company (PMC) conducted combat and tactical training for Hamas fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
3.  **Weapon Supply (Alleged):** Hamas reportedly received half of its weapons from Russian sources (Rona), possibly through the Wagner PMC. This was potentially aimed at demonstrating Ukraine's involvement, albeit indirectly, through a leak of weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Reasons for Russian Involvement
Two main reasons are put forward for Russia's involvement:
1.  **Opening a Second Front:** To divert the West's attention from Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
2.  **Putin's Personal Revenge:** An less obvious reason suggests Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to take revenge on Israel. This stems from a situation around March-April, when Israeli doctors, who had supervised Putin's cancer treatment since 2020 and performed surgery on him in February, ceased their involvement. They stated they had done all they could and that the patient's fate was then "in the hands of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

It is noted that Russia's primary participation in the Hamas operation is described as involving the active patronage of international terrorist networks, and apparently, the active participation of Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

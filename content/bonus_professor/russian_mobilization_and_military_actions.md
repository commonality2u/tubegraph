The topic of [[Russian military actions in Ukraine | military actions]] and potential [[Russian political and military mobilization | mobilization]] within Russia is addressed, including discussions on the timing of troop withdrawals, the ongoing conflict in Crimea, and the potential for a second wave of [[potential_mobilization_and_military_service_changes_in_Russia | mobilization]].

## Withdrawal of Russian Troops from Ukraine
Russian troops are expected to withdraw from Ukraine once a Peace Agreement is signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. It is hoped that this withdrawal could begin earlier as a gesture of goodwill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Ongoing Military Actions and Their Impact
[[Russian military actions in Ukraine | Military actions]] are intensifying in Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Residents of Crimea are advised to be vigilant and prepare for potential problems such as power and water outages, and possible shortages of provisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. The speaker plans to provide more detailed advice on preparedness for these unpleasant circumstances in a future speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

Society's desire to forget the armed conflict and avoid moral responsibility is noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. However, the speaker believes that the true history of what happened to Russia, especially over the last two and a half years, needs to be covered and reported as part of school socialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. While moral responsibility is individual, the aim is to create an environment where people can honestly confront their past and present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

Regarding military personnel involved in the conflict, those who committed crimes will be held accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>. Those who did not commit crimes will bear moral responsibility, and a new system of socialization aims to help them understand their personal share of responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>. The belief that "we were only following orders" does not remove personal responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.

The speaker notes that if [[Russian military actions in Ukraine | military actions]] are not financed, Russia will have enough money, potentially creating a second or third budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.

## Potential for a Second Wave of Mobilization
The chances of a [[potential_mobilization_and_military_service_changes_in_Russia | second wave of mobilization]] are currently not very high, but the possibility is not entirely excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. Progressive forces are working to prevent this agenda from resurfacing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>. The issue of [[potential_mobilization_and_military_service_changes_in_Russia | mobilization]] is expected to be discussed in late summer or early autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. Updates on this and other important information are primarily shared by General SVR on his Telegram and YouTube channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.

## Hybrid Operations Against Baltic Countries
Specific options for implementing a hybrid operation against the Baltic countries are being discussed for the turn of September-October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. This is considered highly important information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. Residents of Belarus, Kaliningrad region, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia are advised to start preparing for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. Interruptions in network service experienced in Latvia are described as testing of the tools for such hybrid operations in relation to Europe as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

## Consequences of Military Conflict
The return of armed "heroes and participants" of the conflict, many with mental problems, poses a significant issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. The current Russian leadership is not actively addressing this problem, but the speaker's team has a plan to manage it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>. This plan involves psychiatric or special registration for individuals with PTSD, providing special medications to enable them to live in society, and drawing on the experience of other countries that have faced similar challenges, including Russia's own experiences from the wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

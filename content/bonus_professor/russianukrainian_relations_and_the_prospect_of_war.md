On April 14th, a stream with SVR General Viktor Mikhalych discussed the [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Russian-Ukrainian relations]] and the prospect of war, following a conversation between US President Biden and Russian President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Military Preparation and Reasons for Escalation
The military buildup and "rattling of weapons" near the border are not a bluff, but definite preparation for scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The timing of implementation remains the question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Key reasons for this preparation include:
*   **Water Supply in Crimea** The water situation in Crimea is worsening annually and threatens a humanitarian catastrophe, with no immediate solution found by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Water supply is a primary reason for the military posturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Domestic Political Successes** The absence of successes on the domestic political front necessitates external political victories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Putin is known for trying to solve several issues simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

The deployment of troops is seen as a form of coercion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. However, this does not automatically mean the scenario will lead to military action, though it is preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. As of April 14th, the concentration of Russian troops, equipment, and aircraft continues, with no indication of plans being cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## Biden-Putin Conversation and Its Implications
The recent call between Biden and Putin is seen by the Russian leadership as part of the ongoing preparation for [[potential_escalation_of_military_conflict_between_russia_and_ukraine | escalation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Russia is seeking specifics from the US leadership regarding a meeting, including deadlines and agreement topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Who Gained from the Call?
From Russia's perspective, Putin has not gained anything concrete from Biden's call, beyond temporary propaganda satisfaction that someone "chickened out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. No promises were made regarding water for Crimea, nor other successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

From the US perspective, the call was a strategic move by the Biden administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>:
*   It extends an offer for dialogue, a handshake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   The US will not fight for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. A conflict between Russia and Ukraine is not beneficial for the US or the EU due to image and financial costs, and sanctions would hit both sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   The offer also serves as a threat of potential retaliation if dialogue fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   President Biden and US intelligence are well aware of Putin's health condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This means a direct meeting, especially in person and away from Russia, is unlikely for Putin in the near future (three months to a year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The concentration of troops can be done repeatedly, but withdrawing them is less straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

### Prospects for a Meeting
Russia insists on a meeting no later than the end of May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. A meeting would occur only after preliminary, clear agreements are reached and certified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. If an agreement on the meeting conditions and issues is reached, the military threat will subside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

A US requirement for Ukraine to make concessions on Crimea is understood as not immediately implementable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. If talks involve months, it's possible, but not in weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Potential Military Goals and Pretexts
The official narrative for a military action would be "assistance to the residents of Donbas" against a possible Ukrainian attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. However, this reason does not explain the large number of troops amassed at the border with Ukraine and Crimea, nor military communications with Belarus and deployments in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

It is believed that Ukrainian President Zelensky is "absolutely not aimed" at fighting and has removed anyone who hinted at conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. He is perceived as militarily incompetent, and this weakness is factored into Russian preparations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

### Pretexts for War
Several options for provocation are being prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>:
*   **Terrorist Attack in Crimea**: Nikolai Patrushev's statement about Ukraine preparing a terrorist attack in Crimea is seen as a potential pretext, which would be internally orchestrated by Russian domestic forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Odessa Provocation**: A project involving pro-Russian forces preparing provocations in Odessa around May 1-2, with around 40 armed individuals already prepared, could be framed as "salvation of Odessa residents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   **Death of "Russian patriots"**: Plans exist for the staged deaths of "Russian patriots" who fought in Donbas, possibly in Moscow, to attribute to the Ukrainian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. These individuals are likely combatants rather than well-known figures like writers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

## Putin's Health and Succession
Putin's health condition is described as not very good, and he is seriously ill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. His "life horizon" as predicted by doctors was discussed previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. The expectation of his quick death is dismissed as naive, as the system would likely continue with another, potentially worse, leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

### Health and Decision-Making
*   Putin has been in a bunker for a year, avoiding public appearances and imposing strict quarantine on those around him, suggesting a deeper reason than just coronavirus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.
*   His physical horizon is "quite close" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   His health condition is worsening, which means he will soon have to choose a successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>.
*   Occasionally, his behavior appears "extremely inadequate," with instances of raving for 15-20 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. This might be a consequence of potent drugs he uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>.
*   Recent medical examinations, including with specialists, show not everything is in order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

### Unconventional Treatments
Putin reportedly resorts to unconventional methods for his oncology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:17">[00:45:17]</a>:
*   **Shamans**: He went to shamans and views shamanic rituals as normal, similar to others viewing church visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:21">[00:44:21]</a>. This inclination stems from his belief that previous healing from oncology in 2013 was due to "magicians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>.
*   **Urine Therapy**: For a month, Putin has been undergoing "urinotherapy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>.
*   **Occult Rituals**: The resignation of the former head of Tuva was linked to a leak about Putin and Shoigu participating in strange rituals there, including a "black dog" sacrifice with blood and forehead inscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:34">[00:47:34]</a>. Shamanic circles believe this ritual ties Shoigu to Putin, giving Shoigu excessive influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>.

Western intelligence agencies (US, UK, and some European governments) are aware of Putin's health condition and may be factoring it into their policy, possibly opting to "wait for the natural end of his life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>. Biden's recent move is seen as an attempt to delay time, while Putin is in a hurry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:03">[00:55:03]</a>.

### Putin's Fears
Putin is not afraid of conspiracies from his inner circle, as they are loyal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:08">[00:42:08]</a>. However, he was "very afraid" to stay in Moscow during the January protests, fleeing the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>. He fears mass protests, especially during and after elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>. A military conflict is considered as a way to indefinitely postpone elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>.

## Putin's Authoritarian Rule and Influence
Putin believes that everything in Russia, including people's lives, is his <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. Law enforcement agencies are seen as his personal guards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>. He only understands and responds to strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>.

### Sanctions
Sanctions imposed by the West are considered ineffective, as they do not personally concern Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>. The idea that he would not start a war due to lack of money is dismissed as "stupid," as he controls all the country's money and reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>. Sanctions do not affect the mood of his military-political inner circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:49">[00:32:49]</a>.

### Drug Trafficking as a Hybrid War Tool
Drug trafficking is a serious problem in Russia and is controlled by the Russian leadership, specifically Patrushev under Putin's guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. This control serves as a "serious lever of pressure" on Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>.
*   Stopping drug flow to Europe would worsen crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.
*   Flooding Europe with drugs would increase addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.
*   Approximately 80% of drugs in Europe are supervised by the Russian leadership, including distribution networks, particularly those from Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>.
This control is an element of "hybrid war" that can be activated to cause "heroin riots" in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

## Belarus and Lukashenko
Putin's plans regarding Belarus have shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>. Before the Belarusian revolution, there were clear plans to absorb Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>. Paradoxically, the revolution helped Lukashenko stay in power, as otherwise Putin would have imprisoned him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a>. Putin does not need a rebellious province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. Currently, Putin's focus is on Ukraine for a geopolitical victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>.

The Belarusian revolution has lost momentum, and its chances for renewal are doubted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>. Lukashenko is expected to negotiate with the opposition to be recognized as president, with a prospect of his eventual departure, but he is an "old fox" and unlikely to fulfill his promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.

## Consequences of War
If [[potential_escalation_of_military_conflict_between_russia_and_ukraine | military actions]] begin, partial mobilization would be declared, and martial law imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:46">[01:06:46]</a>. A breakthrough into Ukraine is "quite possible" and likely to succeed, but it would lead to desperate resistance, possibly a civil conflict, and significant political problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:11">[01:07:11]</a>. Putin does not plan to conquer all of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:38]</a>.

### System Collapse
War would lead to a guaranteed collapse of the Russian system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>. The onset of [[potential_escalation_of_military_conflict_between_russia_and_ukraine | military actions]] is beneficial to the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:48">[01:04:48]</a>. The West is not expected to back down or recognize a new status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>.

### Geopolitical Ramifications
Beyond the EU and USA, China and Turkey are significant players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. Putin made a "stupid move" by leaving Russian military personnel in Nagorno-Karabakh, as they are effectively hostages to Turkey and Erdogan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:30">[01:05:30]</a>. If a war starts in Donbass, these hostages would be leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

## Public Influence and Protests
It is crucial for citizens to actively work for change, rather than waiting for external events like a leader's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>. Mass actions, especially those that are "persistent and unwavering," can force the release of political prisoners, including Alexei Navalny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. The Kremlin closely monitors the dynamics and numbers of people at protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>. Solidarity and real, coordinated actions are vital, not just symbolic gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:42">[02:28:42]</a>.

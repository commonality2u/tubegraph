This article, based on a December 4, 2022, recording by Valery Solovyov, explores the interplay of internal propaganda and Russia's position in international relations, alongside its domestic economic situation.

## Domestic Propaganda and Information Control

### Declaration of a Foreign Agent
Valery Solovyov recounts his experience of being declared a "foreign agent" by the Ministry of Justice, a decision challenged in court on December 2, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The Ministry of Justice justified this declaration based on two reasons:
*   **YouTube Monetization** Solovyov activated monetization on his YouTube videos, receiving income from advertisements placed by YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. He notes that this was the same basis for Yuri Dud's inclusion on the foreign agent list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Solovyov asserts he had no other sources of income at that time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
*   **Fees from Western Institute** Solovyov received fees two or three times from a small Western research institute for participating in seminars and conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. He states this is a common practice in academia, where travel expenses and sometimes fees are paid for participation in Western events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

The Ministry of Justice does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the foreign financing and the political nature of content; merely receiving foreign financing is sufficient for declaration as a foreign agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This means any Russian blogger, regardless of content (sports, culinary, social), could be declared a foreign agent if they make statements deemed "allegedly or not allegedly political" and receive foreign monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. An example given is a culinary blogger who states dumplings are borrowed from China; if they receive YouTube monetization, they could be accused of humiliating their country and traditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

Solovyov ironically defines being a "foreign agent" in Russia as loving and protecting one's homeland and doing the best for its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Conversely, he claims that those who "rob your homeland" or buy villas and open multi-million dollar accounts in Western banks are considered "true patriots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

### State Narrative vs. Reality
President Vladimir Putin reportedly noted a "positive dynamics" in reducing poverty levels in Russia, stating it dropped to 10.5% by the end of the third quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Solovyov challenges this, stating that 10.5% still means "every tenth citizen" is in poverty, and that even those considered middle class are not truly rich by decent standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. He further highlights that only 23% of Russians are satisfied with their financial situation, according to a poll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Additionally, 43% of Russians with microcredit loans have overdue payments of over three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This stark contrast suggests a disconnect between the official narrative and the public's reality.

Solovyov criticizes the Russian leadership's perception of reality, quoting a phrase from the film "Kin-Dza-Dza": "The government is nice people. It lives on another planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. He asserts that the entire elite lives on "another planet," not Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This indicates the perceived [[impact_of_political_propaganda_in_Russia | impact of political propaganda in Russia]] on society's understanding.

### Media Figures and "The Hague" Threat
Russian media figures Simonyan and Skabeeva have reportedly stated that if Russia "loses" (in the context of the conflict), "we will all end up in The Hague" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. Solovyov interprets this as an attempt to exercise "collective responsibility," implying that if the propagandists face consequences, so will tens of millions of Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. He refutes this, stating that the propagandists "got rich at the expense of our society" and continue to lie to it, while the general population's paths diverge from theirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.

He further suggests that if these propagandists reach The Hague, they would be "very lucky" as they face a "very high risk of encountering domestic justice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. This rhetoric highlights the [[influence_of_propaganda_and_delegitimization_of_power | influence of propaganda and delegitimization of power]] within Russia. The second reason for such statements is to "probe... the readiness of society for a people's war," questioning if people are "ready to fight for us, for our wealth, so that we do not end up in the dock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

### Shifting Public Opinion
Recent surveys indicate a significant shift in public opinion regarding the conflict in Ukraine:
*   Data from the Federal Security Service (FSO), published by a "foreign agent" media outlet (Jellyfish), shows that 55% of Russians are now in favor of peace negotiations with Ukraine, while only 25% support continuing the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.
*   A Levada Center survey in October similarly found 57% for peace negotiations and 27% for continuing military actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

This shift is attributed to three main reasons:
1.  **Reliable Information** More reliable information about the situation is becoming available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
2.  **Impact of Mobilization** The stage of partial mobilization significantly influenced people's attitudes, as the conflict, previously seen as a distant "computer game," now affects "every home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.
3.  **Fear of Second Mobilization** Growing fears of an "incomparably more extensive" second stage of mobilization are influencing attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. This fear is justified because the Russian political leadership has "no other way to stop the pressure of the Ukrainian armed forces except to throw bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

## International Relations and Economic Impact

### Oil Price Ceiling
The introduction of a ceiling on oil prices by Canada, Australia, the EU countries, and the G7 at $60 per barrel is discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Solovyov notes that this price is "comfortable for Russia" because, in the last week of November, Russian oil sold at a significant discount cost $52 per barrel at the Primorsk port of shipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

However, Russia's leadership declared that it would not supply oil to countries that adopted these restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This is significant because 47% of all Russian oil exports go to EU countries that have adopted these restrictions (with the exception of Hungary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This decision is seen as "shooting itself in the foot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

There is an expectation that oil may still be supplied to EU countries through third countries, involving transshipment in the open sea and delivery under a foreign flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Russia reportedly bought 100 tankers in the month prior, ostensibly for deliveries to China, India, and Asian countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. The EU is also introducing a five-year punishment for those who help Russia circumvent sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

The OPEC decision on whether to expand or increase oil production was anticipated on December 4, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. If the US can pressure oil-exporting countries to increase production, prices will not rise, potentially mitigating Russia's ability to compensate for losses from reduced exports to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. If OPEC refuses to increase production, Russia could compensate for its losses by increasing the cost of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

Regardless, the Russian budget is expected to suffer losses, leading to less replenishment of the reserve fund and a likely increase in the printing press, accelerating inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This analysis illustrates the [[influence_of_international_relations_on_russian_politics | influence of international relations on Russian politics]] and economy.

### Diplomatic Engagements and Conditions
U.S. President Biden stated his readiness to talk to Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. This was met with immediate tension among those expecting a recognition of "Russia's interests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. However, the State Department clarified that talks would only occur "after the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This condition led to a chorus of accusatory words from Kremlin forces against the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. This dynamic highlights [[russian_diplomacy_and_international_relations | Russian diplomacy and international relations]] challenges.

The international context broadly supports providing assistance to Ukraine, though the West has not provided aid in quantities or quality sufficient for Ukraine to achieve its military goals decisively and quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. The pace of military operations is slowing, moving into a positional phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

### Broader Economic and International Context
The chief economist of the State Department, Emily Blanchard, predicts that the Russian economy is expected to fall by at least 20% over the next 8-10 years, leading to a "stable in its decline and degradation" future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The Iranian economy is cited as a parallel example of stable but "very, very gloomy" conditions, linking it to ongoing unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This suggests Russia's [[reputation_and_international_relations_of_russia | reputation and international relations of Russia]] are in decline.

The speaker notes that British efforts are trying to "evaporate our Brothers in different ways," and "Anglo-Saxons are trying to buy Friedman," referring to attempts to freeze assets and exert pressure on Russian oligarchs or influential figures abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This indicates the broader economic and political pressure exerted through [[international_relations and cooperation | international relations and cooperation]] and sanctions.

The future of media and freedom of speech in Russia is anticipated to undergo significant transformations, particularly after a change in power. This includes holding propagandists accountable, a complete shift in state media's role, and the restoration of fundamental freedoms like access to information and expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.

## Accountability for Propagandists and Informers

Following a change in government, there is an expectation of criminal responsibility for propagandists whose actions are seen as akin to "massive and quite effective propaganda work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. From the perspective of Russian criminal law, such work is often clearly classified and warrants legal rather than just moral judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. It is suggested that instead of extradition to an international tribunal, they should face Russian justice, which is considered "much more unpleasant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

Similarly, informers who report on citizens will face consequences. Their full names (surnames, names, patronymics) will be publicly disclosed on official websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. Citizens are encouraged to socially ostracize these individuals, and those who suffered due to false denunciations will have the right to seek compensation for material losses through legal means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>. This public naming and potential legal action will apply to "all without exception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>.

## Changes in Media Landscape

A new government is expected to implement a corresponding legal reform, including a "complete, total illustration of the judicial corps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:39:41]</a>. One of the first steps will be the release of all political prisoners and innocently convicted individuals, with full rehabilitation, including financial compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. A special agency is planned to be created to restore violated constitutional rights of Russian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

Regarding state-controlled media, particularly television, it is believed it will not become obsolete but rather undergo a radical transformation. The "vector of propaganda that television sends will change by 180 degrees" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>. This change is anticipated to be swift and "on command," leading television to "begin to tell us the truth," an "amazing spectacle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.

## Restoration of Freedoms

Key indicators of positive change and an improving atmosphere will include the release of political prisoners and a refusal to block or slow down platforms like YouTube and other social networks currently declared hostile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. These changes are expected to enable people to "breathe more freely and noticeably more freely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. This signals a move towards greater [[prospects_for_democracy_in_russia | freedom of speech]] and access to diverse information.

While immediate socio-economic improvements may not be felt, the changes in the general atmosphere related to media and freedoms are considered "extremely important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. The restoration of free expression and information access will be a significant step towards a "New Russia" that provides opportunities previously denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>.

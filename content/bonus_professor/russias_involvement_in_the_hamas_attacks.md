The speaker, recording on Sunday, October 15, focuses on whether Russia is connected to Hamas's actions and the impact of the Middle East war on the [[impact_of_middle_eastern_conflicts_on_russianukrainian_relations | Russian-Ukrainian confrontation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

## Alleged Russian Involvement

Based on indirect data and insider information, the speaker concludes that Russia was involved in the actions of Hamas against [[international_relations_and_russias_position_on_palestineisrael_conflict | Israel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:18">[01:36:18]</a>. This involvement, though likely under a "foreign flag," was expressed in three key aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>:

*   **Intelligence and Planning Assistance**
    Russia allegedly provided assistance in supplying Hamas with sensitive information and planning the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Wagner PMC Training**
    Instructors from the Wagner PMC reportedly conducted combat and tactical training for Hamas fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
*   **Weapon Supply**
    Hamas is believed to have obtained half of its Russian-made weapons, possibly through the Wagner PMC, to imply Ukrainian involvement in the attack via weapon leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

### Motivations Behind Involvement

The speaker suggests two main reasons for Russia's involvement, often acting under the flag of another "Rona" (likely referring to a state or entity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>:

1.  **Distraction and Second Front**
    The primary motive is to open a "Second Front" to divert Western attention away from Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
2.  **Personal Revenge (Alleged)**
    Another less obvious reason is an alleged desire by Vladimir Putin to take revenge on Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. This stems from Israeli doctors, who had supervised Putin's cancer treatment since 2020 and operated on him in February, stating in March or April that they would no longer be involved in his treatment, effectively leaving his fate "in the hands of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

The speaker notes that Iran and international terrorist networks were also actively involved in the Hamas operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

## Impact on the Russian-Ukrainian Conflict

The situation in the Middle East is significantly affecting the [[impact_of_middle_eastern_conflicts_on_russianukrainian_relations | Russian-Ukrainian armed confrontation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>:

*   **Loss of Media Attention for Ukraine**
    Ukraine has fallen out of the global media's focus since October 6-7, with major Western outlets curtailing online coverage of military actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. The speaker cites a friend's observation that even BBC news hours dedicated no attention to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. This shift in attention means a reduction in "energy" or support for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **Shift in Western Aid Priorities**
    While financial resources are abundant enough to help both Israel and Ukraine, the question arises regarding the supply of weapons and ammunition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Israel is expected to be the priority for weapon supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.
*   **Peak of Western Aid to Ukraine**
    Western aid to Ukraine reportedly reached its peak in the summer and early autumn of 2023 and is now expected to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. The emergence of a new theater of military operations in the Middle East is one reason for this decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.
*   **Ukrainian Offensive's Outcome**
    The Ukrainian offensive failed to achieve its strategic goals this season, though it had positional successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. The autumn offensive is in its final phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. Russian attempts at a counteroffensive in Avdiivka and Kupyansk have also been unimpressive and costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Stalemate**
    The most probable outcome for the summer-autumn campaigns is a transition to mutual strategic defense, characterized by Western experts as a stalemate or dead end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. This strategic dead end appears to be complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.

## Russian Leadership's Internal Focus

A strategic dead end might be beneficial for the [[russian_government_changes | Russian]] leadership, as their focus has shifted to internal issues, particularly resolving the issue of the Supreme Authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. The speaker claims that President Putin is living out his "last days" and is currently being replaced by a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. This double is reportedly making international visits, even to Beijing, where the Chinese side is aware of dealing with a stand-in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.

The speaker cites a well-known Telegram channel for information regarding these claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. The departure of Putin is expected to lead to the destruction of the existing system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a>. The internal situation is described as entering a period of "highest turbulence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>.

This article, recorded on March 6, 2022, delves into the state of [[Media manipulation and lies in Russian Politics | media manipulation]] and [[russian_state_propaganda_and_its_influence | propaganda]] in Russia, drawing parallels to George Orwell's *1984* and analyzing the techniques used to shape [[public_perception_and_information_warfare | public perception]].

## An Orwellian Reality
The current situation in Russia is likened to George Orwell's novel *1984*, where "war is peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>. The speaker refers to contemporary events as the "full implementation" of Orwell's writings, or "Chuzhelism" â€“ a term for idiocy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.

### Examples of "Chuzhelism"
Several instances are cited as examples of this [[perceptions_and_narratives_in_russian_media | distorted reality]]:
*   **President Putin's Fake Speech**: A speech given by President Putin to a female flight crew is identified as a fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:22">[01:47:22]</a>.
*   **Patriarch Kirill's Justification**: Patriarch Kirill reportedly stated that people in Donbass "rebelled against values imposed on them," specifically mentioning "gay parades" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:04">[02:32:04]</a>. The speaker suggests that some individuals would be better off remaining silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a>.
*   **Zyuganov's Biological Laboratories Claim**: Communist leader Zyuganov claimed the existence of 15 biological laboratories in Ukraine developing viruses and bacteria "against the Russian world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:39">[03:15:39]</a>.

## Unconditional Surrender and Martial Law
President Putin reportedly stated that Russia will not stop its operations in Ukraine until Ukraine "lays down its arms and accepts the Kremlin's conditions," which amounts to unconditional surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:17">[03:44:17]</a>.

Despite Putin's assurance that martial law is not planned in Russia "today," the speaker expresses skepticism, citing Putin's history of broken promises, such as not raising the retirement age or changing the constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:09">[04:03:09]</a>. The speaker highlights a key caveat from Putin: martial law is not planned "if suddenly they do not attack us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:38">[04:48:38]</a>. The interpretation of what constitutes an "attack" (e.g., shelling by Ukrainian saboteurs) would be determined solely by the President of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

## Public Support and [[public_perception_and_information_warfare | Information Warfare]]
The speaker notes that President Putin perceived public support for the military operation as a "carte blanche to implement the toughest actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:26">[05:41:26]</a>. However, the speaker, identifying as a specialist in [[public_perception_and_information_warfare | information warfare]] and [[influence_of_youtube_and_media_channels_in_shaping_public_opinion | psychological warfare]], questions the reliability of official sociological surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:05">[06:07:05]</a>.

### The Spiral of Silence
The primary purpose of such sociology, according to the speaker, is to form a "spiral of silence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:25">[08:20:25]</a>. This phenomenon occurs when a perceived minority position in society is silenced because individuals fear being in the minority and opposing the apparent majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:15">[08:26:15]</a>. This tactic is used by authorities in critical situations to:
*   Cause a feeling of righteousness in supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:47">[09:09:47]</a>.
*   Instill a feeling of predetermination in opponents ("everything has already been decided") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:11">[09:14:11]</a>.
*   Generate feelings of hopelessness and deep depression among those resisting the policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:04">[09:34:04]</a>.

## Techniques of Propaganda
The speaker outlines several common [[russian_state_propaganda_and_its_influence | propaganda]] techniques used to form the "spiral of silence" and the desired "picture of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:04">[10:10:04]</a>:

1.  **Magic of Numbers**: People tend to believe statements more if they are reinforced with figures or statistics, such as the reported 71% support for Kremlin policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:20">[10:20:20]</a>.
2.  **Expert Commentary**: Russian television channels and media present "certain kind of experts" (or "quasi-experts") who provide a "friendly chorus of approval from different positions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:58">[10:46:58]</a>. These individuals are often paid to express opinions that align with the state narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:55">[11:33:55]</a>.
3.  **Voices from the Ground**: This technique involves orchestrating public speeches and letters of support from regional officials, municipal authorities, and even seemingly ordinary citizens or groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:04">[11:55:04]</a>. An example given is children from a hospice in Tatarstan lining up in the form of the letter 'Z' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:04">[12:47:04]</a>.
4.  **Emotional Manipulation**: [[russian_state_propaganda_and_its_influence | Propaganda]] seeks to awaken and play on strong emotions, such as compassion and anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:30">[14:13:30]</a>. The phrase "where have you been eight years?" is cited as a means to evoke compassion for those who suffered losses, while simultaneously fostering anger towards perceived culprits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:27">[01:18:27]</a>. Images involving children are particularly potent for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:11">[15:14:11]</a>.

## Fragility of Consensus and Future Outlook
The speaker argues that the perceived "general national consensus" supporting the authorities is "very fragile" and "unstable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:07">[16:02:07]</a>. This consensus is predicted to crumble due to "poverty and food shortages," which are "stronger than billions of words propaganda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:28:13">[16:28:13]</a>.

A significant source of future "shock of revolutionary sentiments" is identified as the middle class, whose life plans and strategies have collapsed within a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:47">[17:09:47]</a>. Additionally, an "anti-Putin consensus" is rapidly forming among "yesterday's beneficiaries of the regime," or the establishment, who are now unable to enjoy their wealth or travel abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:43">[18:33:43]</a>. While not yet ready to join the opposition, they are "tense" and form a "silent" anti-Putin consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:00:39">[20:00:39]</a>. This discontent from below, combined with the despair of the middle class, will inevitably clash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:06">[20:20:06]</a>.

Bloomberg, a reputable business information agency, reportedly stated on the recording date that President Putin "may lose his power" within the next 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:00:09">[21:00:09]</a>. The speaker emphasizes the unprecedented nature of this formulation from a Western media source known for its reliability and its prior accurate reporting on the threat of military conflict between Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:12:35">[21:12:35]</a>. The speaker also recalls their own prior prediction that Putin would "disappear from Russian and international politics" in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:18:19">[22:18:19]</a>.

While acknowledging the current dire situation, the speaker maintains an optimistic outlook, stating that things will "be worse, much worse," but that there is hope and a chance to change the situation in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>. This is presented as "the last chance" for both the people and Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14:12">[24:14:12]</a>. The speaker urges listeners to help those worse off, support hope, defend common sense and human dignity, and remember Alexei Navalny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:07">[24:26:07]</a>. The article concludes with a defiant message of certain victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:08">[26:00:08]</a>.

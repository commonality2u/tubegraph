Rumors have been circulating that Russian officials are actively seeking a "second homeland" where they could reside following a potential collapse of the current regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. This notion has been particularly propagated by a well-known political scientist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

## The Search for Sanctuaries

Preparations for these "bases" are reportedly underway, though their locations differ from those suggested by the political scientist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.

### Latin America: Not a Viable Option
Despite some speculation, Latin America is not considered a feasible destination for top-tier Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. The region is largely under the predominant influence of the United States, meaning no one from the top of the Russian elite would be safe there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>. While second and third-echelon officials might attempt to blend in, there are no guarantees, as the American state machine is capable of extracting individuals from anywhere, including Uruguay, Paraguay, or Ecuador <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

### Africa: The New Haven
Instead, the actual existing "bases" are located in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. Africa is seen as fulfilling a role similar to Latin America in the mid-20th century for those fleeing a regime's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

These alternate airfields in Africa are equipped with:
*   Luxury housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>
*   Reserves of material resources, including currencies and precious metals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>
*   Protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>

Notably, the reputation of the Wagner Group was established and developed in Africa, where they continue to operate successfully, perhaps even more so than on the Ukrainian fronts, with a portion of their forces remaining there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

## Growing Concerns and New "Diets"

The mood among [[russian_political_landscape_and_potential_changes | Russian officials]] is reportedly shifting, reflecting a growing sense of hopelessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. This is observed even within the political institutions that form the backbone of Russian power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

Informal reports indicate that officials within these institutions have adopted a "new diet":
*   Breakfast includes a dose of alcohol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>
*   Lunch adds another dose of alcohol plus a "specific amplifier of mental processes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>
*   Evenings conclude with a cocktail of these substances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>

This increase in alcohol consumption among officials is noted as a means to forget the "terrible present" and "even more terrible prospects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. President Putin himself has reportedly expressed dissatisfaction with this trend, maintaining a moderate attitude towards alcohol personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

<div class="callout">
**No Way Out**
The situation for [[russian_political_landscape_and_potential_changes | Russian officials]] appears largely hopeless:
*   A military victory is no longer expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>
*   Public support cannot be relied upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>
*   There seems to be nowhere to flee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>

## Revelations from Gleb Karakulov

Gleb Karakulov, identified as a captain (a low rank) in the Technical division of the Federal Security Service (FSO), served in the special communications service of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:38">[01:31:38]</a>. The FSO is a large organization, potentially comprising up to 50,000 people, and certainly more than 30,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:55">[01:55:55]</a>. Karakulov's service primarily involved providing communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>, and he functioned exclusively as a technical specialist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:22">[02:22:22]</a>.

The presidential security service, considered the "holy of holies" of the FSO, is a distinct entity from where Karakulov was located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a>. Signalmen who serve the president are always in a separate building, bunker, or room, and rarely see the president, only from afar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:49">[02:49:49]</a>. Due to his rank and function, Captain Karakulov could not have been part of any security circle close to the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>.

His revelations, primarily from "smoking rooms" or rumors spread by auxiliary FSO personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:49">[03:49:49]</a>, are largely based on information received in places known to be wiretapped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:31">[03:31:31]</a>. Many important FSO employees are monitored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>. The speaker asserts that almost everything Karakulov stated had already been known from other sources for at least the past two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:12">[04:12:12]</a>. Karakulov's opinions on the president's physical health are considered unfounded, as he would have no direct knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:21">[04:21:21]</a>. It is suggested that Karakulov is attempting to raise his value by presenting information as exclusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:41">[04:41:41]</a>. Over the past two years, several more high-ranking and influential FSO defectors have not shared their information publicly because it is genuinely sensitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:04">[05:04:04]</a>.

## Ukraine's Nuclear Ambitions

Regarding the possibility of Ukraine regaining nuclear weapons if Russia suffers a defeat, the speaker states there is "no chance whatsoever" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:45">[05:45:45]</a>.

## Future of the Russian Orthodox Church

The end of the "special military operation" is predicted to coincide with a very serious, large-scale [[Potential economic and political crisis in Russia | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:03">[06:03:03]</a>. During this crisis, all institutions, structures, and individuals in high government positions, including Patriarch Kirill, will suffer significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:15">[06:15:15]</a>. The church itself is expected to emerge from this crisis "suffered and ragged," having lost its "gloss" and "fat" gained from contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:28">[06:28:28]</a>. The Russian Orthodox Church is described as integrated into the general propaganda against Ukraine, as evidenced by the discourse of its Primate and his suppression of priests who speak against the armed confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:58">[06:58:58]</a>.

The Russian authorities' reaction to the abolition of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate in Ukraine is negative, but they are unable to take real action beyond complaining and attempting to integrate it into Russian propaganda, which is largely ineffective as Russian citizens are not very interested in what happens in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:31">[07:31:31]</a>.

## Internal Societal Dynamics and Denunciation

The number of denunciations in Russia has increased by 128 times compared to the previous quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:55">[07:55:55]</a>. Despite this, the speaker believes a significant portion of the Russian population (15-20%) are "agents of change" who desire to live and work honestly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:47">[09:47:47]</a>. For this to happen, the political and legal frameworks must change to encourage honest work and business, free from corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:10">[09:10:10]</a>. This change is predicted to lead to a new Russia, a "new Russian Republic," which will be a consequence of a very acute political crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:20">[12:20:20]</a>. Individuals are identified who are ready to participate in these changes, driven by ambitions for both societal improvement and personal career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:48">[12:48:48]</a>. This opportunity for change is expected to begin opening up in just over a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:24">[13:24:24]</a>.

## Presidential Elections and Leadership

Messages from the presidential administration (AP) suggesting an 80% outcome for the "only candidate" in the 2024 presidential elections are attempts by authorities to project control and show "everything is going according to plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:47">[10:47:47]</a>. However, the speaker asserts that Putin will "definitely not participate" in the 2024 elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:15">[11:15:15]</a>. If elections occur, they will be without him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:25">[11:25:25]</a>. It is considered "extremely doubtful" that elections will happen at all, with "other events" being more likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:21">[11:21:21]</a>.

## Economic Outlook and Denomination

The issue of denomination has been discussed in the Kremlin for the last two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:06">[14:06:06]</a>. The speaker argues that many past decisions, like raising the retirement age, lacked common sense and were based on irrational factors, such as conversations with a "shaman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:52">[14:52:52]</a>.

Monetary authorities are increasingly pushing for denomination, viewing it as a means to combat inflation and resolve financial problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:09">[19:09:09]</a>. New money has already been printed, possibly 1.5 to 2 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:31">[15:31:31]</a>. Inflation is rising, and the national currency's rate is falling due to tactical reasons (e.g., Shell's withdrawal) and strategic reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:49">[15:49:49]</a>. The government aims to fill its acute budget deficit by lowering the ruble exchange rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:15">[16:15:15]</a>. Economists from Alfa Bank estimate the dollar needs to reach 115 rubles to cover lost budget revenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:33">[16:33:33]</a>. A strengthening of the ruble is expected by the end of April, but in the long term, the ruble will weaken "dramatically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:08">[17:08:08]</a>.

Regarding denomination, it involves reducing the number of zeros in the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:08:08">[18:08:08]</a>. This process might involve a limited timeframe for currency exchange (e.g., one month) or a gradual withdrawal of old money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:36">[18:36:36]</a>. During denomination, deposits might be temporarily frozen to prevent panic, as people have withdrawn significant savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:45">[19:45:45]</a>.

To preserve savings, it is advised to buy currency (e.g., dollars or digital dollars like USDT) when the ruble strengthens, or to purchase desired goods now before prices increase further due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:39:39">[17:39:39]</a>. Dollars are not expected to be cancelled in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:48">[21:48:48]</a>, as the US provides financial stability and money loves stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:31">[22:31:31]</a>. The exact timing of denomination depends on the president and the overall [[military_and_political_situation_in_ukraine | military-political situation]], with autumn being a suggested, but not confirmed, timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:46:46">[20:46:46]</a>. It's also possible a future government, not associated with Putin, might undertake denomination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:07">[21:07:07]</a>.

## Repressions and Personal Safety

There is discussion about a possible wave of repression against those who supported Navalny. The speaker clarifies that this concern applies to those who sponsored his team's activities on an "industrial scale," meaning large sums, not small individual transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:19:19">[26:19:19]</a>. Large cryptocurrency transfers can also be tracked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:41:41">[26:41:41]</a>. An example given is the former owner of Rolf, Petrov, who was one of the largest sponsors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:02">[27:02:02]</a>. Individual small donations (tens, hundreds, thousands of rubles) are generally not of interest to authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:19:19">[26:19:19]</a>.

For personal safety, it is advised to maintain a sober head and common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:06:06">[38:06:06]</a>. If one is not in a high-risk group (e.g., a leader or deputy chief of staff of a banned organization, or an industrial-scale financier), the risk is minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:36:36">[38:36:36]</a>. General preparedness includes encrypting data, being mobile, having a passport (preferably not at home), and sufficient cash (currency and rubles) to quickly relocate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:12:12">[39:12:12]</a>.

## Future of the Russian People and Leadership

The speaker believes that a "very difficult time" is approaching for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>, but that the country will ultimately change for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:03:03">[25:03:03]</a>. However, those who are afraid or unwilling to suffer through these changes are advised to consider leaving, with the option to return later when Russia will "need its sons and daughters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:38">[13:38:38]</a>. It is stated that it's better to struggle abroad than to "tremble before the violence" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:30:30">[25:30:30]</a>.

## The Club of Torn Apart Patriots

The creation of the "club of torn apart Patriots" is viewed with an "exclusively humorous" and "satirical" attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:40:40">[39:40:40]</a>. Its members are described as having a "good past" and "faded glory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:51:51">[39:51:51]</a>. The club is assessed as having no influence on the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:24:24">[40:24:24]</a>. Igor Strelkov is noted as an exception, having a future in the developing events in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:15:15">[40:15:15]</a>.

## Negotiations on Crimea

A statement by a Ukrainian official regarding readiness for negotiations on Crimea after Ukrainian forces reach the administrative border with the Crimean peninsula is seen as an announcement of part of an "American peace plan" proposed to Putin last fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:15">[41:15:15]</a>. This plan involves Ukraine regaining its "new territories" in full, while the status of Crimea remains suspended for 7 years of negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:31:31">[41:31:31]</a>. A condition of these negotiations is that the Black Sea Fleet would have to leave Sevastopol and relocate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:50:50">[41:50:50]</a>. This plan is currently "absolutely unacceptable" for the Russian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:03:03">[42:03:03]</a>.

## Risk of Nuclear Weapon Use

A critical factor in [[Potential political and military actions involving Russia | Putin's possible decision-making]] regarding the use of tactical weapons is his deteriorating physical health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:01">[29:01:01]</a>. As he faces the end of his physical existence, he may develop a "strong hatred for the whole world" and consider rash decisions, potentially leading to the thought, "so don't stay for anyone this world, let everyone leave with me," increasing the risk of such actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:38:38">[29:38:38]</a>.

## Accountability and Societal Outlook

Those responsible for "fatal decisions" that caused harm to Ukraine and Russia must be punished by law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00:00">[31:00:00]</a>. While specific individuals are known, the speaker is unsure if all will be punished, though it would be harder for them to hide now than in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:19:19">[31:19:19]</a>. The majority of "mass participants" or "scapegoats" will likely go unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:32:32">[31:32:32]</a>. A key goal for future changes in Russia is to establish greater justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:09:09">[32:09:09]</a>. The speaker notes that the majority of Russian society is not currently concerned with Ukraine and will likely continue not to be after the conflict ends, with only the "nuclear support" (10-15% of "z-patriots") potentially remaining worried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:46">[32:46:46]</a>.

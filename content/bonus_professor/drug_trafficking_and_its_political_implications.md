Drug trafficking is identified as a serious problem that significantly impacts both foreign and domestic policy in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>. It is considered one of the key pillars supporting the current Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>.

## Scope and Oversight

Drug trafficking routes extend across Russia to European countries and also within Russia for internal distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. Specifically, heroin flows from Novorossiysk to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>. This illicit trade is directly supervised by the Security Council of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>, led by [[russian_domestic_political_situation | Patrushev]] under the direction of [[russian_domestic_political_situation | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.

## Geopolitical Lever

Control over drug trafficking serves as a significant lever of pressure on Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>. The Russian leadership is aware that a sudden halt or a deliberate flooding of European countries with drugs can gravely impact their political situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>.

### Strategic Outcomes

*   **Cessation of Supply**: A sharp cessation of drug supplies leads to an exacerbation of the crime situation, as addicts desperately seek their next dose, driving up prices and instantly increasing crime rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>.
*   **Flooding of Supply**: Conversely, flooding countries with drugs leads to an increase in addiction and destabilizes internal situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.

The control of drug trafficking is a crucial tool for the Russian leadership in its dealings with Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>.

## Element of Hybrid Warfare

This control is considered an element of a hybrid war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>, which can be activated at will by the Russian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>. It is estimated that approximately 80 percent of the drugs circulating in Europe are supervised by the Russian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>, including their arrival and distribution networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. Many of these networks, particularly those originating from Syria, are entirely under the control of Russian special services, with Russian agents embedded within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.

There is a possibility that, on the eve of a conflict, Russia could halt drug supplies, potentially triggering "heroin riots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>. Such a prospect has been part of discussions within relevant circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:29">[00:37:29]</a>.

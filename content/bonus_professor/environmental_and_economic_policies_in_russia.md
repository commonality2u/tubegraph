## Environmental Policies
The speaker's team plans to implement stricter pollution control measures in Russia. This initiative aims to elevate control to "one of the absolutes" because the Earth and water are considered "our Earth" and "our water" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. The goal is to ensure the homeland is not only prosperous and fair but also ecologically clean, providing quality food for its inhabitants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. This focus on environmental quality is deemed one of the most important tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

This policy comes in response to concerns about agricultural land being reallocated for oil drilling, which is noted to lead to environmental degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

## Economic Policies

### Retirement Age Reform
There are plans to first revert to the original retirement age values, and then potentially equalize the retirement age for men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. This specific scheme is part of broader, detailed [[economic_challenges_and_reforms_in_russia | economic programs]] and a comprehensive plan for social development in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

### Financial and Economic Stability
A denomination of currency is considered an "inevitable stage" for Russia to exit the current [[economic_and_financial_challenges_in_russia | financial and economic crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. Recommendations have been made to stock up on foreign currency like dollars and euros to protect savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. It is believed that a ban on currency circulation is "almost unbelievable" and "counterproductive" as a black market would inevitably emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

### Cost of Living and Income
Policies aim to reduce the cost of public transport, taxis, train, and plane tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. This could be achieved through subsidies, particularly for air travel, which is essential for a country of Russia's size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. A primary policy objective is a "significant and gradual but also constant increase in the income of Russian citizens," which would make transport more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

### Regional Development and Budgetary Federalism
The current situation where economic activity centralizes in Moscow is viewed as "qualitatively unhealthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. The team plans to foster regional development by creating new development centers and stimulating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>. This involves allowing regions to retain a larger share of their income, initiating "budgetary federalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. Recognizing the differing levels of development across Russian regions—politically, economically, and culturally—the policy will be differentiated accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. The ultimate goal is the transformation of Russia into a true federation, contingent on people learning to take responsibility for their local areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

### Rural Revival Program
A "De-urbanization of Russia" program is planned, which includes financial support for people of age to resettle in rural areas and contribute to the "Revival of the village" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>. The funding for such programs would come from ceasing military actions and ending large-scale theft, which is projected to free up substantial budget resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.

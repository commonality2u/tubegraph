On Thursday, October 26th, at approximately 9 pm, Russian President [[Vladimir Putins alleged death and replacement | Vladimir Putin]] allegedly died in his Valdai residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. This claim was made by Leri Solovey during a special edition of the program "What's Happening," aired on Friday, October 27th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Solovey had previously stated publicly multiple times that [[Vladimir Putins alleged death and replacement | Vladimir Putin]] would not survive the autumn and would likely die even earlier, specifically no later than October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Efforts to Conceal Death

Solovey asserts that there will be attempts to hide [[Vladimir Putins alleged death and replacement | Putin's death]], noting that such concealment is possible in authoritarian regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. He provides examples where deaths were hidden for extended periods: Heydar Aliyev, Hugo Chavez, and Islam Karimov for three months, and Zhirinovsky for a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

According to Solovey, the concealment of [[Vladimir Putins alleged death and replacement | Putin's death]] is made easier because he has been "very successfully replaced by a [[allegations_of_putins_double | double]]" for the past two to three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:04">[04:04:04]</a>. This [[allegations_of_putins_double | double]], or "deuce" in professional jargon, can be used for a short time, estimated at a maximum of two to three months, to cover the transition to a post-Putin era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. Solovey notes that attempts were made to hack his accounts after he began discussing these events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. He believes that the more denials and lies spread about a topic, the faster the information they want to suppress actually spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

## Implications of the Alleged Death

The speaker suggests that if the aim is to maintain the status quo, there will be no new liberties or freedoms, nor will there be a reduction in military tension on the fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. Instead, there might be further tightening of controls, as the government is afraid of public reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. A decision was reportedly made in October, when [[Vladimir Putins health and political future | Putin]] was no longer able to negotiate a strong position with Ukraine, meaning de-escalation cannot be expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

However, Solovey states that [[Vladimir Putins alleged death and replacement | Putin's death]] has "torn the core out of the regime he created," causing it to begin an irreversible decline, "just like an avalanche" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. This event is seen as opening a "window" for change, which will increasingly depend on the actions of the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

## Call to Action and Future Outlook

Solovey encourages viewers to choose the "right side of history" and support those fighting for freedom and justice for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. He suggests reposting information, liking content, and providing financial assistance to ensure the dissemination of information and support the cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. He concludes by stating that events will develop rapidly and expresses certainty that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

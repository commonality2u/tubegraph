The Russian president is facing significant humiliation in the [[diplomatic_relations_and_international_cooperation | international arena]], leading to forced misrepresentations by the Kremlin regarding his status and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. This public and non-public humiliation highlights a perception among the elite, including the Western elite, that the president is a "dying nature" and a "lame duck," incapable of making decisions publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

## Reasons for Kremlin's Deception

The Kremlin's leadership, including press secretary Peskov, engages in "elementary brazen lies" to manage perceptions of the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The primary reasons for this deception are:

1.  **Maintaining Reputation**
    It is necessary to show that Putin is "afloat" and a "wise Leader" who is in complete control of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This effort aims to repair a reputation that "suffered catastrophically" in the eyes of the elite, the deep state, and society after the recent events involving the Wagner group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
2.  **Projecting Physical Capability**
    The Kremlin seeks to convey that the president is physically capable and in "decent condition," a claim that does not correspond to reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Assertions of his public appearances and meetings, such as the alleged meeting with Prigozhin, are considered hoaxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Sources suggest that the president is "physically unable" to appear anywhere and is constantly replaced by doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    > The existence of a double is not doubted by any representative of the Russian elite or any self-respecting intelligence service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. An examination conducted in a G7 country, involving phonoscopic and anthropological analysis by multiple independent experts, concluded that "three different people" are seen under the general name of the Russian President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Diplomatic Challenges and Humiliation

The third significant reason for the Kremlin's fabricated narrative pertains to the president's humiliation on the [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_challenges_for_russia | international stage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

### The Erdogan Factor
Turkish President Erdogan's recent actions demonstrate this humiliation:
*   He transferred Azov fighters to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   He supported Ukraine's accession to NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   He promised Ukraine intensive military aid and the construction of factories for Bayraktar drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

Despite these actions, the Kremlin and Putin "have to keep quiet" because Russia is "critically dependent" on parallel imports that pass through Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This dependence allows Erdogan to dictate terms, whereas Putin previously treated him with respect, even calling him "Raja" or "Sultan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This situation highlights Russia's constrained position in its [[kremlins_foreign_policy_and_decisionmaking | foreign policy]] due to its reliance on certain international partners.

### Macron's Refusal to Engage
Another "invisible" act of humiliation is the French President Macron's refusal to engage with Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   In contrast to 2005, when Macron reportedly sought conversations with Putin for almost 100 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, Putin now seeks to speak with Macron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   The French president is refusing immediate responses to requests, and Kremlin servants are resorting to "roundabout ways" to convince Macron to talk to Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

This reversal of roles is described as a "pinnacle of geopolitical skill" for the former "most terrible man on the planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, indicating his current state of being "despised" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Implications for the Presidency

The continued need to lie and assert control, despite evidence to the contrary, is a direct consequence of the president's diminished physical state and international standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. The "inactive president" relies on doubles for public appearances, including trips to regions and abroad, which are considered "extremely risky undertaking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This situation points to an ongoing crisis within Russia, opening opportunities for civic engagement to shape a future beyond the current regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

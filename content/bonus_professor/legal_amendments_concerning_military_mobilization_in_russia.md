On April 11, 2023, significant legal amendments were introduced in Russia regarding military service and [[potential_mobilization_and_military_service_changes_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. These changes follow an apparent failure in the campaign to recruit contract soldiers into the Russian armed forces, particularly in major cities like Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. With an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive and potential heavy losses, the Russian armed forces may require compensation for these losses, which could only be achieved through [[military_preparations_and_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

The amendments primarily focus on the unified register of persons liable for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Key Amendments

### Electronic Summonses
Electronic summonses are now legally equivalent to paper ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. A summons is considered automatically received the moment it is posted in the personal account of a person liable for military service on public services platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This applies to all persons liable for military service, not just conscripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. However, this specific rule does not apply to the spring draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Restrictive Measures for Draft Dodgers
Expanded restrictive measures, or penalties, will now affect all individuals liable for military service who evade a summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. If a person does not appear voluntarily within two weeks of receiving a digitally signed summons from the military commissar, they will face immediate restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

These restrictions include:
*   A ban on leaving the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   A ban on driving vehicles, effectively canceling their driver's license <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   A ban on concluding real estate transactions (e.g., buying or selling apartments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   Inability to register as an individual entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   A ban on taking out loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   The expected blocking of bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

These measures are intended by the authorities to compel individuals to fulfill their "civic and patriotic duty" and appear for military service during [[mobilization_and_military_policies_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Potential Impact and Advice

These amendments could potentially affect over 20 million citizens, with some estimates reaching up to 27 million people who could be mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. The database for non-departure already contains over 14 million entries, though some are due to other reasons like unpaid alimony or debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Individuals are advised to:
*   **Decide on their personal duty:** Reflect on whether to comply with a summons, acknowledging the risks of death or serious injury, or prioritize family and personal well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Promises of financial benefits for demobilized individuals or care for families are deemed unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Stay calm and prepare:** There is likely time, at least until the May holidays, to take meaningful action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Consider deactivating public services accounts:** If an individual does not have a public services account, an electronic summons cannot be delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. It is possible to close these accounts remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Consult lawyers regarding asset transfer:** Since general powers of attorney are unlikely to circumvent new restrictions on property and business transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, individuals with reliable contacts might consider transferring ownership of assets like cars or property. Professional legal advice is crucial due to the inherent risks and potentially irreversible legal consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Develop multiple plans:** Individuals should think through what actions they will take if a critical decision regarding [[russian_political_and_military_mobilization | mobilization]] is made, preparing themselves, their families, and potentially agreeing on mutual assistance with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

The topic of [[mobilization_and_military_policies_in_russia | mobilization]] has generated significant discussion and concern, with emerging details indicating an increasingly "ominous" enterprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. These plans are expected to be implemented after the New Year holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Proposed Scope of General Mobilization

There is an intention to mobilize a significant number of people, potentially reaching up to two million individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, including 300,000 women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This new [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization process]] is anticipated to be more organized and tougher than the initial phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. It will no longer be referred to as "partial" but declared as a [[general_mobilization_readiness_in_russia | general mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Concerns exist regarding the Russian authorities' ability to provide adequate uniforms, equipment, and other necessary supplies for such a large number of mobilized people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Despite these doubts, the authorities are believed to be determined to achieve these goals, viewing the increased numbers as a means to at least withstand Ukrainian offensives and solidify Russian defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Martial Law Implications

The [[russian_political_and_military_mobilization | mobilization]] is planned in conjunction with the introduction of [[potential_martial_law_in_Russia | martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Martial law has already been implemented in the "new territories" of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> and is expected to be extended after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This extension may cover all or a significant part of Russia, including Moscow and St. Petersburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Powers Under Martial Law

The implementation of [[internal_russian_mobilization_and_possible_martial_law | martial law]] grants authorities several rights and capabilities:
*   **Labor Mobilization**: Individuals not called up by the active army, including those aged 14 to 65, can be subjected to labor mobilization to strengthen the country's defense capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Nationalization and Ownership Changes**: Authorities can force a change of ownership or take over organizations and enterprises, with part of large corporate and private business property potentially being nationalized or transferred to "patriotic hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Seizure of Private Property**: There is a possibility of seizing private property with subsequent compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Restriction of Communication and Information**: Martial law allows for restricting freedom of communication and the use of information, potentially including blocking platforms like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### Enforcement and Readiness

To facilitate the [[military_preparations_and_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization process]]:
*   Summonses are reportedly already prepared in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   Photos of those subject to [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] are being entered into Moscow's facial recognition system, one of the world's most effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This could allow authorities to approach individuals in the Moscow metro and direct them to mobilization points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   A database transferred to the border service could include up to 7 million people potentially subject to [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. While not all 7 million are expected to be mobilized, they may face a partial ban on leaving the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Impact and Considerations

### Personal and Financial Impacts
*   **Students**: Full-time students with military IDs are unlikely to be mobilized, but those in their final year may face a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **Women**: The mobilization of women will primarily target doctors and medical personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, though other specialties with military registration may also be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Travel**: While a complete ban on leaving Russia is unlikely, a partial ban for those in the mobilization database is very possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. For those living abroad, returning to Russia during this period carries the risk of being mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Loans and Mortgages**: In the event of [[general_mobilization_readiness_in_russia | general mobilization]], a deferment of payments for loans and mortgages is probable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The state's response to debt obligations if a person dies at the front remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Savings and Assets**: Currency deposits are already frozen and forcibly converted to rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>. The ruble is expected to become "catastrophically unstable" during a crisis, while the dollar is likely to remain stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. Selling assets like apartments or cars to withdraw funds depends on personal strategy and plans to leave the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

### Societal Outlook
*   **Protests**: The protest potential of Russian society is considered high, though authorities are actively suppressing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>. The reaction to a potential second wave of [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] and its aftermath remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.
*   **Future Hardships**: Russia is anticipated to face "troubled days," with disorganization and chaos that could make the 1990s seem like a faint reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>. However, the impact will be contextual, varying by location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.
*   **Food Security**: While widespread food shortages are not expected next year, disruptions due to logistics are possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. Some regions are preparing for the introduction of food rationing or food cards to provide access to cheap provisions for socially vulnerable groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.
*   **Economic Priorities**: Financing for government procurement, repairs, and reconstruction in the social sphere is expected to be reduced, while spending on the defense industry will increase significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.

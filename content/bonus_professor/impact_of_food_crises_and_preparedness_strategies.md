## Overview of Food Security in Russia
Despite potential "hard times to buy food" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>, a speaker confidently states there "will be no famine in Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. While a political crisis, especially one involving armed force, might take on acute forms primarily in the Russian capital and a few other cities for a short duration, this is not expected to lead to widespread famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>.

## Preparedness Strategies for Potential Interruptions
Although famine is not anticipated, "some interruptions in supply are possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. Therefore, certain [[economic_issues_and_crisis_preparation | preparedness strategies]] are recommended:

*   **Provisions:** Individuals should make a reserve of provisions, ideally a week's supply, or even 10 days to 2 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>.
*   **Water:** It is important to stock up on drinking water, such as a few bottles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.
*   **Power/Electricity:** A battery for charging devices is advisable, as problems with electricity may arise in areas experiencing significant events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.
*   **Cash:** Having cash on hand is crucial. The unrest in Kazakhstan in January 2022 demonstrated that problems with internet and online payments can occur, making cash essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

## Current Food Price Increases
A "monstrous increase in chicken eggs and meat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a> is currently being observed, a situation last seen a year prior. However, specific predictions on what will happen next with food product price growth cannot be provided at this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.

Valery Solovey, in the 12th episode of his program, addresses pressing questions regarding Russia's current political landscape and future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. He discusses the ongoing military actions in Ukraine, the state of Russian leadership, and the prospects for fundamental change within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Putin's Health and Doubles

Solovey asserts that President Putin uses doubles, a fact he claims to have been discussing for the past two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. He suggests that in February, observers could discern different behavior patterns between Putin speaking before the Federal Assembly and Putin at a concert in Luzhniki, indicating these were "different people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This, he says, is now a "common shared opinion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, well known to the Russian elite and the president's main staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

He anticipates that after an upcoming course of treatment in March, Vladimir Vladimirovich will primarily appear online, while his double will engage in public appearances for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Solovey refutes the idea that information about Putin's "severe incurable disease" and the use of doubles is tightly controlled, stating that such information has gradually leaked out due to the large staff and connections of those aware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. He claims that major Western intelligence agencies are aware of the Russian president's health and factor it into their military-political planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

## The Future of Military Actions in Ukraine

Solovey does not share the Pentagon's pessimism that military actions could drag on for three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. His view is that the outcome of the military conflict will be predetermined before the summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. While this does not mean an automatic cessation of actions, any continuation after that would be due to "fading inertia" and attempts to find a political solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Regarding the possibility of a "Korean version" where the conflict freezes, leading to Russia's self-isolation and degradation, Solovey considers this "extremely low, tending to zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Post-Putin Leadership and Transition

The cessation of military actions will depend on who comes to power after Putin's removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Solovey believes that if a specific, likely force comes to power, military actions will not automatically cease and might even intensify temporarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This intensification would serve as a bargaining chip for better conditions to withdraw from Ukraine and end the confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

Solovey states that the question of who will run in the 2024 elections will be decided in 2023, emphasizing that 2023 is "the year you decide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

## Political Crisis and Russia's Future Trajectory

Solovey does not believe that Russia is "doomed" to an alternation of negative leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. He asserts that a [[potential_political_crisis_in_russia | political crisis]] is "inevitable" for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. However, he believes the disintegration of Russia is unlikely, only theoretically possible if this crisis is "very long and very fierce," potentially lasting around three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. While risks of internal weakening and separatist tendencies exist, fundamental risks of Russia's collapse are not present from his perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

He emphasizes that Russia will have an opportunity for change, likely in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. He urges people to be ready to act when a "clear and distinct signal" arrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

## Economic Outlook

Solovey rates the work of Nabiullina and Siluanov (the financial block) as "highly successful" for saving Russia from financial catastrophe in the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. However, he warns that a "white furry animal" (e.g., a financial crisis) is approaching the Russian financial and banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Based on Nabiullina's assessments, the system's safety margin will likely last until summer, but "very serious problems" are expected in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Nuclear Threat

Solovey acknowledges that the Supreme Commander-in-Chief (Putin) considers the use of nuclear weapons an acceptable option, leaving it open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. However, he expresses hope that the world will not need to check if such an order would be carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>.

## International Relations and Minsk Agreements

Solovey refutes the notion that the West wants to weaken Russia or deprive it of independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. He argues that relations between Russia and the West were "so positive" and "mutually beneficial" under Putin before Putin "screwed it all up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

He concurs that the Minsk agreements were "fiction" from all sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. Ukraine and its Western supporters pursued the goal of "winning time," viewing it as a "Brest Peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. The Russian side, conversely, sought to legitimize its plan for Ukraine, influence it through the agreements, and essentially embed a "built-in bomb" by altering Ukraine's constitution and status to a confederation critically dependent on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

## The Role of the People in [[Change in the political landscape in Russia | Change]]

Solovey emphasizes that a sense of responsibility and action from the Russian people is crucial for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. He uses an analogy of a burning house: when one's house is on fire and the earth is burning under one's feet, the priority is to save oneself, relatives, friends, and native soil, rather than debating future plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. He criticizes the question "if not Putin then who?" as coming from those "challenged by fate, challenge to intellect state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. He stresses that only by uniting for "salvation" can the country emerge from its current predicament <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

Solovey confirms that "such a chance will be given to all of us" in 2023 to influence the [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | destiny of their country]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. He encourages people to contribute to solving "practical problems of changing life in Russia" and "changing Russia itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>.

Solovey concludes by stating that 2023 "has every chance of being the year when the fate of Russia and ours will begin to change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>. He assures viewers that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:08">[00:35:08]</a>.

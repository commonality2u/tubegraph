The world is currently undergoing a significant transition, moving away from the clearly ordered structure observed in the 1980s. This shift, which began in the 1990s with the collapse of the Soviet model of socialism, is leading to a new, unknown global quality [00:00:28]. While the future is uncertain, conscious human activity can influence its development [00:01:48].

## The Dominant Group in the New World

In this emerging world, the [[role_of_nonpublic_and_secretive_organizations_in_global_politics | financial elite]] is expected to be the dominant group, referred to as the "gentlemen" [00:10:46].

### Characteristics of the World Financial Elite
*   **Hermetic and Status Quo-Oriented** The global financial elite is not inclined to expand but rather prefers to maintain its status quo through a degree of closure [00:11:05]. This tendency is particularly noticeable among Anglo-Saxon and European elites [00:11:17].
*   **Influence through Non-Public Organizations** These elite groups are represented in various [[influence_of_nonpublic_organizations_on_global_politics | non-public organizations]], often mistakenly called secret societies [00:11:25]. There are about a dozen to a dozen and a half such influential organizations worldwide [00:11:38]. These are not mere platforms like the Bilderberg Club but rather more influential order-type organizations [00:11:43]. They include the "cream of Western society" [00:13:34].
*   **Goals Beyond Wealth** The primary goals of these organizations are not solely the acquisition of wealth [00:12:40]. Instead, they are deeply interested in the knowledge and transformation of human nature [00:12:45]. These organizations often have long histories [00:12:59].
*   **Lack of a World Government** Despite their influence, these organizations do not constitute a world government, and such a government does not appear to exist due to the inherent impossibility of organizing it and the existence of free will [00:49:36]. Their aim is to maintain global balance and harmony, which they believe is currently disrupted by the Kremlin [00:49:12].

### Relationship with Russian Elites

Russian elites, particularly those who have amassed significant wealth, express a strong desire to join these Western non-public circles but are generally not accepted [00:13:38]. This rejection stems from several reasons:
*   **Lack of Consistent Identity** Western elites question the shifting political identities of Russian counterparts, who were communists, then "pure Denikin and Kolchak," and now seek new statuses [00:14:24].
*   **Lack of Mission and Responsibility** Members of these Western organizations typically possess a strong sense of historical responsibility for their nation and mission, which their potential Russian counterparts lack [00:14:55].
*   **Perception of Corruption** Russian elites are often viewed as "thieves" by Western circles, making dialogue and acceptance difficult [00:15:15]. This perception is independent of ethnicity, although ethnic networks (like Jewish networks) can facilitate entry as affiliated members if vouched for [00:16:34]. Western elites, including special services, deeply despise Russian security officers, leading to significant problems in professional cooperation [00:17:14].
*   **Focus on Money and Power** From the Western perspective, the primary motives of many Russian elites are money and power, often at the expense of leaving a positive historical mark [00:18:08]. They want to leave a "good memory" but are unable to pursue alternative projects due to fear of conflict with the Russian authorities [00:19:10].

### Influence and Pressure on Russian Politics
*   **Monitoring and Control** The Russian authorities maintain tight control over its own wealthy elites. Since 2012, the FSB has had a special department that monitors the top 100-150 wealthy Russians, specifically looking for political investments against the will of the presidential administration [00:20:04]. Any such deviation threatens a "complete catastrophe," with the example of Khodorkovsky serving as a strong deterrent [00:20:41].
*   **Economic Pressure** [[western_pressure_on_russian_elites | Western non-public organizations]] have the capacity to apply economic pressure and will support sanctions against the Russian elite, viewing such measures as their "merit" [00:48:09].
*   **Impact on Russian Leadership** The Russian leadership is perceived as lacking confidence in its own strength, often resorting to brutal repression and harsh rhetoric to project power [00:52:09]. They fear change and a loss of control, including the influence of the West [00:52:48]. The current Russian leadership, particularly President Putin, is seen as less willing to engage in conflict than in previous years [00:39:32].
*   **Asset Management** Russian elites are increasingly transferring their assets into physical forms (tons of dollars and gold stored in real storages, often in Africa or Latin America) rather than digital or traditional bank accounts, driven by a psychological need to physically see and feel their wealth, and potentially out of fear of Western access to their digital assets [00:54:14].
*   **Indirect Influence** These non-public organizations operate through people and institutions. While they may not directly instruct actions like the poisoning of Navalny, they are participants in broader circumstances that lead to such events [00:44:53]. Their influence on the fate of Russia will ultimately be decided by the peoples of Russia themselves, as these organizations respect the principle of free will [00:47:02].

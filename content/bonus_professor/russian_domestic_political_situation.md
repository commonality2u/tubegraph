Valery Solovey's program, episode 124, discusses recent events impacting [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian sociopolitical dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Death of Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi

Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi, known as the "Iranian Butcher" or "Tehran Butcher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, died in a plane crash on May 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Raisi earned his nickname due to his role in the Iranian judiciary, which is described as "overly humane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. While there is much speculation, the circumstances of the crash currently suggest a natural disaster rather than a man-made one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The impact of his death on Russian-Israeli relations is a subject of inquiry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Due to a lack of reliable information, it is advised not to engage in idle speculation regarding the internal situation in Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## The Beijing Visit and its Implications

The primary event of the past week for the Russian Federation was the trip of "so-called president so-called Putin" – identified as a double named Evgeny Vasilyevich – to Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. He was reportedly "sent to Beijing" by the "real masters of Russia" to "receive a label from the Chinese Bogdykhan to reign in Moscow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Kremlin's Goals for the Visit
Moscow had several objectives for this visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>:
*   **Legitimization of the Double** China's acceptance of the "president" was intended to encourage broader international recognition or at least prevent ostracism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Pressure on Ukraine Summit** Russia sought China's influence to prevent Ukraine from participating in the "Tsarist summit on Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Continued Military Support** Guarantees of ongoing Chinese support for military operations against Ukraine were critical, as Chinese dual-use products are essential for Russia's military sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Without Chinese aid, Russian military actions would subside within months, and the economy would likely not last beyond six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Resolution of Bank Payments** The Kremlin aimed to resolve issues with bank payments stuck or returned by Chinese banks, which significantly hinder mutual trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Power of Siberia 2 Gas Pipeline** Russia hoped to secure China's consent for the construction of the "Power of Siberia 2" gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Beijing's Goals for the Visit
China's objectives for the visit were primarily two-fold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>:
*   **Observe Russian Leadership** To assess the "new composition of the Russian leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Secret Agreement on Territories** More importantly, to gauge Moscow's readiness to fulfill a "secret agreement" signed by the "late Russian President Vladimir Putin" with Xi Jinping in February 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This agreement, hidden from the Russian public, grants China a 49-year lease of vast territories in Siberia and the Far East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This lease includes the right to develop natural resources and establish administration, effectively placing these territories under Chinese control and outside Russian jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This agreement is viewed as an act of national treason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   The agreement is set to come into practical effect on January 1, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   The Kremlin sought to postpone this agreement, fearing a "monstrous scandal and [[domestic_russian_political_dynamics | domestic political crisis]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
    *   China, however, did not agree to postpone the treaty, demonstrating its superior position over Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. The speaker describes China as acting "as a master looking down on Moscow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Humiliation of the Russian Delegation
The visit was characterized by the "colossal, unprecedented humiliation" of the Russian delegation and the double "Evgeny Vasilyevich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **One-on-One Meeting** The so-called one-on-one meeting between "Putin's double" and Xi Jinping was not a genuine private discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. No substantive strategic issues were discussed; it consisted mainly of "praises of wisdom, strength, and strong-willed dignity of the Chinese leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. The meeting included a translator and individuals controlling the double to prevent him from saying anything "unnecessary" or "idiocy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Delegation Treatment** Some members of the Russian delegation were denied access to toilets, highlighting the complete control exercised by their Chinese hosts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Symbolic Agreement** An agreement on cooperation regarding Bolshoy Usuriysky Island, formally divided but considered wholly Chinese on Chinese maps without Russian protest, serves as a "serious hint" that the Kremlin might be willing to implement the secret agreement despite the risk of [[internal_political_situation_in_russia | internal political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Absence of Key Figures** Sergey Chemezov and Nikolai Patrushev, described as the "two real masters of the Russian land," did not attend the Beijing visit, reportedly to avoid being held responsible for the humiliating requests and insults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Outcomes of the Visit
The Chinese did not make decisions on any major issues, including bank payments or the "Power of Siberia 2" gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Regarding Ukraine, Chinese reports from the meeting provided only general statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Notably, after the meeting, China indicated it would consider sending a delegation to the Swiss summit on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Overall, the meeting achieved only a "very modest legitimization of the double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. This outcome is considered offensive to Russia, common sense, and national dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

### Belousov's Appointment
The Chinese showed significant interest in Belousov, seeing him as a potential "new strong man" in the Russian government with whom to conduct business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Belousov's attitude towards China is reportedly "restrained suspicious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. His appointment was the result of a "fantastic coincidence" or "skillfully conducted intrigues" reflecting a new alignment and balance within the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>.

## Future Implications for [[russian_political_landscape_and_potential_changes | Russian political landscape and potential changes]]
The territorial integrity and national sovereignty of the Russian Federation have been called into question by the secret treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. The current Russian leadership, at least in part, is ready to implement this act of national treason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. In the near future, Mishustin is expected to resign, leading to a radical renewal of the Cabinet of Ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. These developments are predicted to "shake Russia" and affect Russian-Ukrainian relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

For more details on the background of [[russian_political_climate_and_leadership | Russian political climate and leadership]], including Belousov's appointment and the implications of the secret treaty, an online meeting titled "Tip of the Spear against the Tip" will be held on May 23 at 8 p.m. Moscow time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. This paid meeting will provide further insights into the true background of Russian politics and the plans of those governing Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

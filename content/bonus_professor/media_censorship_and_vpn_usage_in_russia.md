The media landscape in Russia has seen significant changes, particularly regarding censorship and the availability of independent information, leading to an increased reliance on alternative methods for accessing content, such as VPNs.

## Erosion of Independent Media and Public Opinion
Prior to recent events, what could be considered [[importance_of_alternative_media_in_russia | independent media]] in Russia, though never fully independent, provided an [[importance_of_alternative_media_in_russia | alternative point of view]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. However, these "instruments of influence have disappeared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

The ability of [[future_of_russian_media_and_freedom_of_speech | leaders of public opinion]] to voice dissent is severely curtailed, with any content deemed "seditious" likely to be suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Even influential figures like Navalny, calling for protests from prison, face insurmountable obstacles in organizing due to widespread police presence and lack of avenues for consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The disappearance of independent media means there is no platform for such calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

Despite these restrictions, a small "spark" of hope is maintained by those who continue to [[importance_of_alternative_media_in_russia | educate people]] about current events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## State Propaganda and Public Reaction
The [[russian_state_propaganda_and_its_influence | propaganda patriotic dope]] continues to operate effectively, influencing public perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. While official polls suggest high support, the speaker doubts their veracity, noting that people tend to give [[public_reaction_and_propaganda_in_Russia | socially approved answers]], especially during sensitive times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>. This means the actual public sentiment might lean "against" the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.

People are increasingly turning away from traditional television news, finding it "pointless to watch new things on TV" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>, and recognizing the potential for [[youtube_blockage_in_russia | YouTube to be blocked]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.

The authorities have actively sought to destroy [[importance_of_alternative_media_in_russia | alternative channels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>, leaving no one in Russia who dares to publicly criticize the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

## Impending Internet Restrictions and VPN Usage
The hosts extensively discuss the current and potential future restrictions on internet access:
*   Facebook and Twitter are already inaccessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.
*   Efforts are underway to block YouTube, with a potential final blocking within a week and a half or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.

Given these developments, the hosts strongly advise viewers to install VPNs immediately, without waiting for the full blockage:
*   Viewers are urged to watch a previous broadcast about "bypassing blocking with a furry climate screaming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>.
*   A specific free VPN called "Psycho" (distinguished by advertising clips) is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.
*   The advice is to "put a VPN right now" rather than waiting until access is cut off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>.

> "The internet is blocking, but it is known how I feel about some media resources here I think that they themselves are to blame in many ways living in this illusion of attempts to maneuver the results of activity everything has become worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>.

The process of restricting internet access, including social networks and major bloggers, is described as "already been decided" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.

### Broader Repression
Beyond media, the discussion extends to [[current_and_potential_future_restrictions_in_Russia | broader repression]]:
*   A ban on leaving the country is anticipated, with airport conversations already taking place and FSB operatives checking phones for social media usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:12">[00:38:12]</a>.
*   Exit visas and interviews to determine the purpose of travel are also expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:14">[00:42:14]</a>.
*   Restrictions on taking out money (over ten thousand dollars) are already in place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>.
*   The trial of Alexei Navalny is noted as largely ignored amidst the current crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>.
*   Future repressions are expected to target "disloyal" individuals, bloggers, and cultural figures, but also "mass groups" to intimidate them into silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:43">[00:47:43]</a>.
*   The goal is to maintain "total loyalty," with a focus on identifying and punishing "troublemakers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:42">[00:49:42]</a>.

The speakers conclude that Russia is moving towards a mixture of old Soviet-era practices of repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>.

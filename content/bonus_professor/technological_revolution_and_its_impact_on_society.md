The world is currently undergoing a significant transition, marked by a shift in quality and complexity. While not solely driven by technological advancements, the technological revolution plays a crucial role in shaping this evolving global landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## The Nature of the Shift

The world is moving away from the clearly ordered state observed in the mid-1980s, which represented a peak of maturity and complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The transition began in the 1990s, coinciding with the collapse of the Soviet model of socialism, and has since been influenced by a cluster of overlapping changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Impact on Human Nature and Education

The colossal technological revolution, while transformative, is observed to lead to a [[future_predictions_and_societal_impact | simplification and unification of human nature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This includes a decrease in the level of intelligence, noticeable among students. The vast culture developed by European and world civilization by the end of the 20th century is disappearing, as interests have significantly shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Educational Segregation
A significant difference is noted between students in mainstream universities and those in elite institutions, particularly in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Universities, traditionally seen as instruments of anti-segregation by offering quality education to overcome social discrimination, are now becoming instruments of segregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Umberto Eco's concept of "the new Middle Ages" is invoked, where universities might play the role of "new monasteries," serving as repositories of sacred knowledge for an elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. For many young people, reading large texts has become a psychologically insurmountable task, as attention spans are now "tiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. The ability to read becomes a fundamental social skill, differentiating those who can plan strategies from those with a "goldfish" memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Societal Implications and Freedom

In this evolving world, it is predicted that there will be a "huge number of restrictions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. However, people may not perceive these limitations because they are initially limited, lacking sufficient education or the will to pursue knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Acquiring knowledge often requires self-overcoming, a "dielectric transition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

The world is increasingly permeated by gamification, creating a "huge illusion" or "simulacra" where people live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This results in a lack of desire or will to "break through" this illusory reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This societal state echoes Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*, where people become so immersed in systems that their existence disappears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

The world is becoming a "flesh" of "say goodbye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, where a "gigantic culture" has disappeared, and people live on the ruins of a once-understood ancient world, having lost the meaning of many artifacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

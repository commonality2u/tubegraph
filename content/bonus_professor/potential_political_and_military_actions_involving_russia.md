This article summarizes discussions from Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, episode six of "Answers to Hot Questions," recorded on Thursday, December 1st. Solovyov addresses various public inquiries regarding [[potential_political_and_military_developments_in_russia_and_ukraine | Russia's current situation]], including military actions, political stability, and societal dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Current State of Affairs and Public Understanding
Solovyov notes a decrease in questions from viewers but an increase in flattering letters, with some admitting their initial skepticism about his predictions had changed due to recent events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of "flexibility of intellect" and the ability to rethink situations, a quality he finds lacking among some people who cling to their positions as part of their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

He points out that the disclaimer on his videos has become longer due to a new law that came into force on December 1, requiring a disclaimer that the material is for people over 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Regarding public understanding of the situation, Solovyov suggests that people like Nadezhda Doschina from Khabarovsk, whose son was mobilized, can find answers by honestly addressing three questions:
*   Who crossed the state border on February 24? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   On whose land are military operations taking place? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>
*   Where did taxes go that were supposed to provide the armed forces with first-class weapons and excellent equipment, forcing pensioners to equip their mobilized relatives themselves? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>

He asserts that answering these questions honestly, without bias or influence from central television channels, will clarify the essence of what is happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Views on Emigration and "Slaves" Accusation
Solovyov states he is calm about people who have gone abroad, understanding they have serious reasons for leaving, and believes most will return when the situation in [[possible_future_political_changes_in_russia | Russia changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

He refutes the accusation of calling ordinary people "slaves," clarifying that he described a "way of life like slaves" when discussing sociology about the proportion of income people spend on provisions and everyday goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. He emphasizes his respect for his people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Political Power Dynamics
Solovyov believes that the "Chekists" led by Patrushev will not hold onto power because the existing system in [[potential_political_transition_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | Russia]] is the "Putin system," revolving around Vladimir Vladimirovich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Once Putin's influence lessens, a "life-and-death struggle" for power and resources will begin among other elite groups, weakening the Chekists' current influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Personal Motivation and Fear
When asked what drives him, Solovyov states it is a "moral imperative" to do what he considers necessary for a man and a citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. He acknowledges that his current lifestyle is "terribly unpleasant" and he faces the daily risk of detention under false pretexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. His strength comes from this moral imperative, the support of his family, and his love for the Motherland, aiming to make it better and for people to live better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. While these things don't completely relieve fear, they give meaning to his actions and partly compensate for his fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## [[potential_military_actions_and_geopolitical_influences | Potential Military Actions and Geopolitical Influences]]

### Mobilization and Future Requirements
Solovyov states that the presidential decree did not stop mobilization, only conscription within its framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. If the second stage of mobilization involves increasing the number of mobilized people up to two million, criteria for conscription will need to be softened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This means mobilization will likely extend to those without combat experience and those who did not serve in the armed forces, significantly expanding the affected population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. He does not expect the age limit to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

Regarding uniforms and equipment, he anticipates that citizens will continue to purchase them themselves, taking out loans and going into debt to increase the chances of their relatives' survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. If Kalashnikovs are insufficient, he suggests North Korea will provide aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

### Expansion of Martial Law and Total Control
Solovyov warns that the second stage of mobilization could be linked to the expansion of martial law to large [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | Russian cities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. New, frightening information suggests plans for almost complete control over the population via QR codes, which would differentiate citizens into three groups:
1.  **Largest group (over 70-80% of population):** Prohibited from leaving their subject of the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
2.  **Second group:** Expanded travel abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
3.  **Smallest group (most trusted, including security forces):** Allowed to move throughout the [[geopolitical_consequences_and_crisis_predictions_in_russia | Russian Federation]], but not leave the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

Leaving the country may require a special permit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Additional restrictions could include a curfew and the possibility of internment, allowing detention for 30 days without trial or investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. A special detention center near Moscow, Sakharov, is reportedly intended for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

Despite these plans, Solovyov expresses serious doubts about their full realization due to [[speculation_on_russias_future_political_actions | Russia's organizational inefficiencies]], predicting they will quickly devolve into chaos, disorder, and total disorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. This growing discontent and disorganization could influence the supreme leadership's decision-making regarding martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. He concludes that "nothing good awaits us, only bad things" regarding mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. There are also plans to block bank cards for those in the mobilized database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

### Prospects of Political Crisis and Elite Response
There is a probability that "Turbo-patriots" (imperialists) could win as a result of a [[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_russia | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The elite's ability to prevent this will depend on their determination, resources, and societal support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. He urges listeners to consider supporting this elite, as the choice will be between "bad, very bad, and absolutely unacceptable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

### Russia's Territorial Integrity
Solovyov believes [[geopolitical_consequences_and_crisis_predictions_in_russia | Russia will not disintegrate]] unless the impending political, socioeconomic, and financial/banking crisis becomes protracted, lasting for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Even in a long-term, fierce crisis with intensified disintegration tendencies, he remains an optimist, believing Russia will not disintegrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

### Military Expansion into Transcaucasian Countries
Military-political plans for expansion into Transcaucasian countries like Georgia and Armenia have existed for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. However, judging by the [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | Russian armed forces' performance in Ukraine]], Solovyov sees "practically no chance of implementation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. All main and secondary forces are currently in Ukraine, and the military elite, including the General Staff, is against such plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

## Societal Aspects

### Putin's Knowledge of History and Personality Cult
Solovyov contends that while Putin is interested in history, he "knows it very poorly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. His relationship with history is biased, selecting facts that confirm his views, which were formed by Soviet textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. For example, Putin is convinced that Russians and Ukrainians are "one people," which Solovyov states is "completely untrue" from a historical and cultural perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. Putin was particularly interested in the period preceding WWII and the Great Patriotic War, but his lessons learned appear to have been "harmful and counterproductive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

Solovyov predicts that the personality cult of the current leader will undoubtedly be dispelled, beginning even during his lifetime as he noticeably weakens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. The same propagandists will suddenly change their tune, leading to a "collapse" where much more will be revealed about his "exploits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

### Monitoring and Censorship
Solovyov does not believe law enforcement will conduct checks of Muscovites' subscriptions to "unpatriotic" YouTube channels due to a lack of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. However, he thinks it is possible that YouTube could be closed altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>, though he notes authorities also use YouTube intensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. He advises against having "questionable materials" on phones when traveling abroad, as they might be checked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.

### Stockholm Syndrome and Imperial Syndrome
He explains [[speculation_on_russias_future_political_actions | Russian society's]] apparent "Stockholm syndrome" and "imperial syndrome of the beggars" as a form of compensation for a "terrible present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. People rationalize their difficult reality by finding explanations that flatter them, such as the idea of "greatness" or "state superiority," often amplified by propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. When confronted with facts, people tend to close off the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. He states that the level of xenophobia in Russia is lower than in many European countries, but its manifestations are more visible due to the lack of a "total culture of political correctness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.

### Revolutionary Movement and Radical Elements
Solovyov disagrees with the idea that a revolutionary movement in [[possible_future_political_changes_in_russia | Russia]] will necessarily be leftist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. He suggests that radical populist elements, not necessarily leftist, have a higher chance of political manifestation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. He cites Yevgeny Prigozhin as an example of a radical populist with significant military and financial resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>. Leftist rhetoric can also be successfully used by right-wing politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

### Fate of Pro-Russian Residents in Crimea and Donbass
In the event of Ukrainian armed forces occupying Crimea and Donbass, Solovyov anticipates that some pro-Russian residents will face consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. Based on the experience of Kherson's return, those considered collaborators (actively assisting Russian authorities, even with humanitarian aid) would primarily be subjected to repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>. The entire population would undergo a "filtering" process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. He describes this as an "inevitably built-in risk" in a high-intensity armed confrontation, especially for Ukraine, which sees it as a struggle for national independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. This confrontation will take on a "radical and brutal character" in the post-war period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

## Conclusion
Solovyov concludes by stating that "nothing good awaits us, only bad things," urging listeners to be prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. He expresses gratitude for financial and moral support, which allows him to continue his work despite being deprived of rights due to the new law on agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. He advises people to save money for themselves and their families for the New Year, helping others only to the best of their ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. Despite the difficulties, he maintains, "victory will be ours, it will certainly be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.

Public speeches and expressions cover a range of communicative acts, from formal addresses and patriotic declarations to personal anecdotes and responses to public inquiries.

## The Art of Expression
A Russian person, for example, is said to be capable of drinking with shaking hands, a feat once demonstrated by People's Artist Lebedev at the Leningrad BDT, who pulled himself up through a towel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This highlights a resilience or particular character trait expressed through action. Common jokes and sayings, such as "Stop drinking and get on his skis," are also recognized as widely understood expressions that signal a specific moment or call to action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Sometimes, individuals may choose not to discuss certain topics publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Patriotic Declarations
Speeches often include patriotic expressions about the nation. Russia is described as "our beloved country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, a "free fraternal peoples Union" extending from "the southern thieves to the Polar region" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The vastness of "our forests and fields" is also highlighted, with a call for wisdom to be glorified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The fatherland is celebrated as unique, with the declaration, "you are alone in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Public Discourse and Criticism
Public forums allow for direct engagement, with individuals asking if they can pose questions, even in German <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. However, there can be [[Criticism of the Russian Presidents speech | apprehension about what a speaker might say]], leading to statements like being "afraid to listen to you any longer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Addressing Public Perceptions
Individuals in the public eye may face questions about their identity and authenticity. One speaker noted that classmates often express disbelief, asking, "Is it you or not?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. In a public setting, a student from St. Petersburg State University inquired about the truth behind rumors of the President having many doubles and his views on the dangers posed by artificial intelligence and neural networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The President responded by stating that while others may resemble him and speak with his voice, he believes "only one person should look like me and speak with my voice and that person will be me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. He also acknowledged that artificial intelligence could be considered his "first double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Emphasizing [[Personal achievements and professions | Personal Achievements]]
Public figures often use speeches to share [[Personal achievements and professions | personal achievements]] and experiences. The speaker proudly stated he worked in a construction team and was awarded the qualification of a fourth-category carpenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. He maintains pride in this qualification, even though his "fate turned out differently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, and emphasized the importance of learning to "do something with my own hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

When asked about other professions he might have, the speaker explained that he received the fourth category as a student in a student detachment while working in the USSR, necessary for receiving a decent payment of around 1,000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. He mentioned that his team was involved in projects like the Vostochny Cosmodrome and Olympic facilities in Sochi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. He recounted a conversation with a former US President who doubted his carpentry skill and asked for proof, which he provided, leading to the President's surprised response, "Well, I'll kick their ass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## New Year's Addresses

The past year is described as a period of hard work and significant achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. The nation was proud of common accomplishments, rejoiced in success, and remained firm in defending national interests, freedom, and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Despite facing "colossal challenges" and harsh conditions, the ability to solve complex problems was attributed to solidarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a> and the shared responsibility for the Motherland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

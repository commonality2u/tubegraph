The future of [[russian_political_landscape_and_potential_changes | Russia's political landscape]] is anticipated to undergo significant changes, though not without considerable challenges and turmoil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. While the immediate prospects for a change of power are considered small, it is expected to occur in the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Predictions for Political Change

The chances of a [[possibility_of_political_change_in_russia | change of power]] in Russia within the current year (referring to 2022) are described as "tiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, though not zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. It is more likely to happen next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Initially, a [[possible_future_political_changes_in_russia | change of power]] is predicted to lead to a period where conditions worsen, possibly for a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

It is believed that Russia will eventually become a truly democratic country within our lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. However, for democratic institutions and procedures to function effectively, it is estimated to take at least 10 to 15 years, or possibly more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Driving Forces and Key Figures

The main driving force behind a potential "Russian coup" is not expected to be the opposition or Russian society, but rather the elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This process will likely begin as an elite conflict, with some factions seeking public support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Regarding [[russian_political_landscape_and_potential_regime_changes | Putin's departure]] from Russian politics, predictions made for 2022 are not being renounced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. However, the chance of it occurring is decreasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Unseen but important events in December (2022) could push this process to a decisive stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The "horizon" for his legal capacity is extremely limited, and his entourage is aware of this, potentially accelerating the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. Forecasts from Andrey Valerievich Kosmos regarding Putin's departure align with other sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

Dmitry Medvedev is not considered a viable candidate for Putin's successor, as he is widely perceived, even by Putin, as a "clown" and is not trusted by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. The scenario of Lukashenko becoming the leader of Russia has a zero probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

## Post-Change Environment

Following a political shift, external threats to Russia are expected to be significantly minimized, particularly in the western direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The primary challenge and danger for Russia would then shift to the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

An approaching period of "turmoil" is seen as inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This turmoil will not lead to the collapse or death of Russia, but the country will experience very serious upheavals, potentially a more dangerous and acute crisis than that of 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Despite this, both the country and society are expected to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Impact on Belarus
The future of Belarus, specifically its potential integration with Russia or breakaway, is said to depend exclusively on the dynamics of the [[potential_changes_in_russias_political_landscape | political situation in Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. When a crisis begins in Russia, Belarus is expected to naturally distance itself, requiring Lukashenko to leave his post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

## Long-Term Outlook

Despite the gloomy prospects and anticipated difficulties, there is an overarching belief that "light awaits us at the end of this tunnel," with the "sun of a new Russia" emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. A firm conviction is expressed that, no matter how hard it is, "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

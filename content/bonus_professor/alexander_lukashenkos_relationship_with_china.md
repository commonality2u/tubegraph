[[political_situation_in_belarus_and_the_fate_of_lukashenko | Alexander Grigorievich Lukashenko]] is described as having a new "older brother," implying China as a significant ally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This relationship was highlighted by [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_the_fate_of_lukashenko | Lukashenko]]'s three-day visit to Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

## Objectives of Lukashenko's Visit to China
During his visit, [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_the_fate_of_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] sought several assurances and forms of assistance from China:
*   **Sovereignty Guarantee** To guarantee the preservation of Belarus's sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **Political Support** To provide political support for his authoritarian regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Financial Aid** To provide financial assistance to his regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

## Belarus's Stance on the Russia-Ukraine Conflict
[[political_situation_in_belarus_and_the_fate_of_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] publicly declared his support for the [[chinese_influence_on_russianukraine_conflict | Chinese plan for a peaceful settlement]] of the armed confrontation between [[kremlins_diplomatic_strategies_with_ukraine_and_the_west | Russia]] and [[kremlins_diplomatic_strategies_with_ukraine_and_the_west | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. He also demonstrated loyalty to China, viewing its leader as the "new master of Eurasia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## Dynamics with Russia
Despite perceptions from [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Russian]] conspiracy theorists, [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_the_fate_of_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] did not convey any messages from the [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Kremlin]] or [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] to [[legitimization_of_russian_leadership_in_china | Xi Jinping]] during his visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Instead, he was "exclusively busy with solving his own problems," which caused "discontent" in the [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Kremlin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

[[political_situation_in_belarus_and_the_fate_of_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] seeks to balance the influence of the [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Kremlin]], [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]], and [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. He aims to protect Belarus from "not only the actual but also the formal absorption" by [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This concern stems from the belief that if the [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Russian]] president were to lose the confrontation with [[kremlins_diplomatic_strategies_with_ukraine_and_the_west | Ukraine]], he might try to absorb Belarus to compensate for the failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Consequently, [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_the_fate_of_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] is actively trying to secure Beijing's support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

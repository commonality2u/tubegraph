The current [[militarypolitical_situation_in_russia_and_ukraine | military-political situation]] between Russia and Ukraine is characterized by significant military preparations and tensions. This includes the rattling of weapons and troop movements near the border [00:01:04].

## Nature of Preparations

The troop movements and deployment are not a bluff; they represent an "unambiguous preparation of scenarios" [00:01:10]. The question remains whether these scenarios will be implemented and within what timeframe [00:01:14].

This preparation is seen as "practically coercion" [00:02:44]. However, the deployment does not necessarily mean that the situation will escalate into direct military actions [00:02:48].

As of April 14th, 2021, the concentration of Russian troops, equipment, and aircraft is continuing, with nothing changing yet [00:06:46].

## Reasons for Escalation

Several reasons are cited for Russia's military preparations:
*   **Water Supply in Crimea** Crimea faces a severe water shortage, which threatens not only the tourist season but also risks a humanitarian catastrophe [00:01:38]. There is currently no clear solution to this problem [00:02:01].
*   **Domestic Political Successes** The absence of significant domestic political successes in Russia demands external political victories [00:02:16].
*   **Multiple Issue Resolution** Russian President Vladimir Putin is known for trying to solve several issues simultaneously [00:02:27].

## Diplomatic Engagements

A conversation between US President Biden and Putin took place, which temporarily "pushed aside" the prospect of war [00:00:51]. This call was viewed as a very good move by the Biden administration [00:05:10]. However, from Russia's perspective, Putin has not gained anything substantial from the call, aside from propaganda material for state channels [00:04:18]. Crimea's water supply was not promised, nor were other successes achieved [00:04:20].

The US is not expected to fight for Ukraine under any circumstances, and a conflict between Russia and Ukraine is not beneficial for the USA in terms of image or finance, as sanctions would also impact the European Union and the US [00:04:32].

Russia is demanding specifics from the American leadership regarding the proposed meeting, including deadlines and specific agreements [00:07:18]. The US requires Ukraine to make concessions on Crimea, which is currently not a priority for Russia [00:07:29]. A meeting would occur only after preliminary, clear agreements are reached [00:08:29].

## Potential Pretexts for Military Action

If military actions were to begin, Russia might set additional goals beyond securing water access for Crimea [00:10:30]. The stated reason for the military build-up, and a potential pretext for conflict, is "assistance to the residents of Donbas," specifically the regions referred to as LNR and DNR, against a possible attack from Ukraine [00:11:12]. However, the sheer number of troops amassed on the borders of Ukraine with Crimea and Russia, as well as near the Belarus border, suggests more extensive plans [00:11:43].

Ukrainian President Zelensky is not seen as someone who would initiate a forceful confrontation [00:12:15]. He has removed anyone who hinted at conflict and does not understand how to manage troops [00:12:32]. This perceived weakness in Zelensky as commander-in-chief is a prerequisite for Russia's planned movements [00:13:08].

Potential provocations being prepared to justify military action include:
*   **Terrorist Attacks in Crimea** Russia's Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev stated that Ukraine is preparing terrorist attacks in Crimea [00:13:33]. It is suggested that if such attacks occur, they would be orchestrated by internal Russian elements in Crimea [00:14:02]. These provocations could serve as a direct reason for the start of military actions [00:14:17].
*   **Odessa Provocation** A project of provocation in Odessa is being discussed for May 1-2, involving prepared pro-Russian forces [00:14:34]. This could be framed as "the salvation of the residents of Odessa" [00:14:57].
*   **Death of Russian Patriots** Plans exist for the staged deaths of "Russian patriots" who fought in Donbass [00:15:26]. This could involve targeting figures like Girkin or other combat writers, not high-profile individuals [00:16:11].

## Military Strategy and Outlook

If military actions begin, partial mobilization would be included in the plans, along with the declaration of martial law [01:06:37].

While Ukraine might be able to resist an invasion, a breakthrough by the Russian army is considered quite possible [01:07:11]. An invasion would likely succeed, but it would face "desperate resistance," leading to a civil conflict within Ukraine [01:07:56]. Russia's plans are not limited to conquering all of Ukraine; there are "other plans" [01:08:16].

A war would likely stimulate political processes within Russia and could lead to the collapse of the existing system [01:04:26]. The beginning of military actions could even be "beneficial to the opposition" [01:04:48]. This is because it would lead to a collapse and the imposition of sanctions by the West, which would refuse to recognize any new status quo [01:05:02].

Other significant players include China and Turkey [01:05:26]. Putin is seen as having made a "very stupid move" by leaving Russian military personnel in Nagorno-Karabakh, where they are effectively hostages of Turkey's Erdogan [01:05:30]. This situation could be exploited if a war in Donbass were to occur [01:06:06].

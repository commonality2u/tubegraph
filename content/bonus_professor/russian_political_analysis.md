The current [[russian_political_climate | Russian political climate]] is characterized by an "Orwellianism," where reality often mirrors George Orwell's *1984*, and fictional concepts become a guide to action [00:00:35]. The phrase "war is peace" encapsulates this prevailing situation [00:01:25].

## Manifestations of Orwellianism
Several examples highlight this perceived reality in Russia:
*   A "fake" speech by President Putin to a female flight crew was disseminated, despite new laws against "fakes" [00:01:42]. This specific "fake" was not categorized under actions against the armed forces, allowing it to go unpunished [00:02:04].
*   Patriarch Kirill, ahead of Lent, stated that the people of Donbas rebelled against imposed values, specifically "gay parades" [00:02:12].
*   Communist leader Zyuganov claimed the existence of 15 biological laboratories in Ukraine developing viruses and bacteria harmful to the "Russian world" [00:03:07].

## Military Operations and Governance
President Putin does not intend to halt military operations in Ukraine until Ukraine "lays down its arms and accepts the Kremlin's conditions," which implies "unconditional surrender" [00:03:31]. This will likely be reframed as a "peace treaty" [00:03:57].

Skepticism surrounds Putin's assurances that martial law is not planned for introduction in Russia [00:04:00]. This distrust stems from his past unfulfilled public promises, such as not raising the retirement age or changing the constitution, and his earlier statement about governing Russia for longer than two presidential terms leading to madness [00:04:13]. Furthermore, Putin's caveat that martial law would not be introduced "if suddenly they do not attack us" is concerning, as an "attack" could be broadly interpreted by the president to justify such measures, for instance, a shelling incident on Russian territory attributed to Ukrainian saboteurs [00:04:46]. This illustrates [[russian_internal_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | governance issues]] and the leader's interpretative power [00:05:26].

## Public Support and Propaganda
President Putin views sociological support for the military operation as a "carte blanche" to implement the toughest possible actions [00:05:31]. This perceived support is heavily influenced by information manipulation and psychological warfare, as detailed in the book "Absolute Weapon" [00:06:07].

### The "Spiral of Silence"
Propaganda aims to create a "spiral of silence," a societal situation where minority opinions are suppressed because people believe they are alone in their views, thus opposing a perceived overwhelming majority [00:08:20]. This strategy is designed to:
*   Instill a sense of righteousness in those supporting the government's policy [00:09:10].
*   Generate a feeling of "predetermination" among opponents, suggesting that "everything has already been decided" [00:09:14].
*   Cause "hopelessness and deep depression" in those resisting government policy [00:09:34].

### Propaganda Techniques
To form the "spiral of silence" and the propagandized "picture of the world," several techniques are employed:
1.  **Magic of Numbers:** People are more inclined to believe statements backed by figures or statistics [00:10:20]. For example, the claim that 71% of Russians support the Kremlin's policy towards Ukraine [00:10:32]. However, the reliability of state-affiliated sociological agencies on sensitive political matters is questionable [00:06:46]. Moreover, the 21% against the operation (every fifth citizen) and 8% undecided (likely intimidated to voice dissent) suggest that the reported support is inflated due to people giving "socially approved answers" out of fear [00:07:19].
2.  **Expert Commentary:** State-controlled media channels feature a "friendly chorus of approval" from "experts" (or "quasi-experts") who are often paid or seek self-promotion [00:10:44]. These "experts" are presented as intelligent figures with credentials, leading viewers to believe their opinions are reasonable and reflect reality [00:11:20].
3.  **Voices from the Ground:** This technique involves featuring voices from regional officials, municipal authorities, and even children ordered by the presidential administration to organize public speeches and letters of support for Russian policy [00:11:55]. An example is children from hospices in Tatarstan being forced to line up in the form of the letter 'Z' [00:12:47], which is described as "disgusting" [00:13:05].
4.  **Emotional Manipulation:** Propaganda aims to "awaken and play on strong emotions" [00:14:13]. A common refrain, "where have you been eight years?" is used to evoke compassion for those who suffered losses, and anger towards perceived culprits [00:14:18]. Propagandists, including Ukrainian ones, frequently show footage of suffering, especially involving children, to elicit compassion and anger [00:15:11].

## Fragility of Consensus and Future Outlook
The Russian authorities' closure of alternative information sources and silencing of dissenting opinion leaders indicate that the "supposedly general national consensus" is "very fragile" and "unstable" [00:15:38]. This consensus is expected to "crumble" as people will "waver and take a critical position" due to increasing poverty and food shortages, which are "stronger than billions of words propaganda" [00:16:16].

Historically, political upheavals do not primarily originate from the perpetually "humiliated and insulted" but from the "middle class" [00:16:46]. In Russia, this class, which had established life plans and strategies for years or even a decade, has seen all its expectations and hopes "collapsed at once within a week" [00:17:12]. While they may not have fully realized the bitter implications yet, this realization is rapidly approaching [00:18:21].

An anti-Putin consensus is rapidly forming, particularly among "yesterday's beneficiaries of the regime" â€“ the establishment who earned billions and aspired to be part of the global elite [00:18:33]. Their inability to spend their wealth or travel abroad has left them feeling ostracized [00:18:57]. Although they are not yet ready to join the opposition or invest in political dissent, they are "tense" and forming a "silent" anti-Putin consensus [00:19:59]. This consensus, which has not existed in Russia for the past 20 years, will inevitably merge with the discontent, despair, and anger of the destroyed middle class [00:20:18].

Bloomberg, a reputable business information agency, stated on March 6th that President Putin "may lose his power" within the next 12 months [00:20:52]. This unprecedented formulation for Western media is significant because Bloomberg was among the first to report on the threat of a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine and Russia's military plans in late 2021, deriving its information from American intelligence sources [00:21:24]. This aligns with predictions that Putin would disappear from Russian and international politics in 2022 [00:22:18].

While the current situation feels as bad as it can get, it is predicted to "be worse, much worse" before it gets better [00:22:54]. Despite this, there is hope and a chance for the situation in Russia to change [00:23:45]. This chance, when it appears, is presented as the "last chance" for the people and for Russia itself [00:24:11].

People are urged to help those who are worse off, support the "spark of hope," defend common sense and human dignity, and remember "moral responsibility" and "morality" [00:24:29]. Special mention is made of Alexei Navalny, who "single-handedly resists the machine" [00:24:53]. Support, including financial aid, is requested for those resisting [00:25:02]. Despite the difficulties, there is a belief that "victory will be ours" [00:25:57].

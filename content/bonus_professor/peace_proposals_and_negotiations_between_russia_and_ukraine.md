Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, in an episode recorded on November 13, discusses a strategic turning point in the conflict, the moral and political catastrophe for Russia, and the search for peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The core of the discussion revolves around [[proposal_for_peace_deal_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace proposals]] received by the Russian leadership following the withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Context of the Proposals
The withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson marked a strategic turning point in favor of Ukraine, solidifying the strategic initiative for Ukraine in the armed confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This event, while not a military catastrophe, is considered a moral, psychological, and political catastrophe for the Russian leadership and establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. It led to the loss of faith in victory within the Russian establishment, which now faces the inevitability of military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Consequently, Putin is seen as a "toxic loser" by the establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The [[proposal_for_peace_deal_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace proposal]] arrived precisely on the day Russian troops left Kherson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The outline of these [[proposal_for_peace_deal_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace proposals]] was previously agreed upon with Ukraine and transferred to the Russian Federation's leadership by a "more than serious" party whose opinions cannot be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Details of the Peace Proposals
The drafted global agreements include several key points:
*   **Territorial Withdrawal** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>:
    *   Russia is to completely leave the territory of Ukraine, including the DPR and LPR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   Crimea is an exception, set to receive an indefinite status for seven years, during which [[consultations_and_proposals_for_resolving_the_ukraine_conflict | negotiations]] would occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
    *   Crimea must be demilitarized, and the Black Sea Fleet must leave Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Demilitarized Zones** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>:
    *   A demilitarized zone 100 kilometers deep must be established along the borders of Russia with Ukraine and Belarus with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   Heavy weapons from Russia are to be removed from this zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Ukraine's Commitments** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>:
    *   Ukraine promises not to join NATO for seven years and not to raise questions about joining NATO during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Transnistria** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>:
    *   The Russian military base in Transnistria is assumed to be moved back to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   In 2023, Russia will not interfere with Transnistria's integration into Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Immunity for Russian Personnel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>:
    *   Russian civilians, military, and political figures are guaranteed freedom and security, and the preservation of at least part of their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This means they are not subject to punishment, though "scapegoats" will likely be punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Those who made the decisions are given indulgences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Reparations/Financial Compensation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>:
    *   Financial compensation for damage suffered by Ukraine was not explicitly mentioned in the received materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. It is noted that Russia would never use the term "reparations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This issue should be discussed during [[prospects_of_a_truce_and_peace_negotiations_in_russian_military_conflicts | peace negotiations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

## Signs of Russian Seriousness
Indirect signs indicate that the Russian leadership took the [[proposal_for_peace_deal_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace proposal]] seriously:
1.  **Tactical Nuclear Weapons Plans** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>: Consideration of plans for the use of tactical nuclear weapons collapsed on Friday, with an order received to curtail them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
2.  **Erdogan's Initiative** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>: Turkish President Erdogan announced his intention to meet with Putin as soon as possible to discuss [[prospects_for_ending_the_russiaukraine_conflict | peace agreement prospects]] with Ukraine, followed by a visit to Kyiv or a phone call with Zelensky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
3.  **Potential Halt of Energy Attacks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>: If Russia abandons the idea of inflicting another massive blow to Ukraine's energy infrastructure, it will be a third indirect sign that the [[proposal_for_peace_deal_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace proposals]] are being taken seriously by the Kremlin, potentially indicating a desire to gain time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

## Ukrainian and Western Perspectives
There is a "bravura Ukrainian escapade" of statements declaring that these terms are unacceptable and Ukraine will "never" agree to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. However, the military capabilities of the Ukrainian armed forces are critically dependent on American aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. If this aid decreases or stops, Ukraine's military capabilities will decrease accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

The American position currently favors a pragmatic approach: inflicting a military defeat on Russia on the battlefield using "someone else's hands" (Ukraine), but without the idea of changing Russia's political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. The U.S. believes that creating a situation for natural change in Russia is better than direct interference, which could backfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Ukraine cannot influence political change or the punishment of the guilty in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>; this must be done by Russian citizens themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

## Internal Russian Dynamics
The consequences of the "moral and political catastrophe" for Russia include confusion within the propaganda machine, an intensification of the search for a way out of the impasse, and recognition of Putin as the main cause of the catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. There is also a noticeable increase in elite discontent, posing a fundamental threat to Putin's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

The Kremlin only considers force and what resists it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Public opinion in Russia could become a force if it unites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. The military will be blamed for Russia's defeat later, likely after a peace treaty is signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>. Initially, "Turbo Patriots" who are loudly critical of the authorities will be repressed and intimidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Censorship will be tightened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. There's a possibility that figures like Igor Strelkov and Alexander Dugin, who are critical of the government, might be made faces of a new "turbopatriot" political party as a false political target to manage discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

Ultimately, the speaker emphasizes that justice does not always prevail and that both individuals and the nation are responsible for their actions and inactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

The Kremlin expresses a strong dislike for Britain, often referred to as "the Englishwoman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This aversion is deeply rooted and manifests in various ways, influencing [[International perspectives on Russian politics|international politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Reactions to British Political Developments

The resignation of Boris Johnson from the post of Prime Minister of Great Britain was seen as directly bearing on Russian affairs related to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Britain is considered the primary protagonist of the anti-Kremlin coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, with Boris Johnson personally embodying this stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. While the continuity of Britain's foreign policy course is expected to be maintained, the Kremlin's reaction to Johnson's departure allowed for "quiet gloating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Reasons for Hostility

Several factors contribute to the Russian president's dislike for the British <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>:

*   **Personal Reasons**: There is a "deeply personal reason" for this animosity, the details of which are not disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Corporate Affiliation**: The hostile attitude is linked to President Putin's corporate affiliation as an officer of the Soviet KGB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. The KGB traditionally instilled hostility towards the British, viewing them as the main competitors of Soviet intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Perception of British Influence**: This historical hostility towards British special services is "extrapolated" to the British political class and British politics as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Britain is perceived as a "spearman" behind serious intrigues against the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

### Contrast with Germany

In contrast to Britain, Germany is viewed differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. German authorities, exemplified by Chancellor Olaf Scholz, have been perceived as less eager to aid Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. For instance, the German government has reportedly blocked the allocation of a 9 billion euro aid package from the European Union for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, allegedly acting in their own national interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Leri Solovey, speaking from Moscow, announced a special edition of the "What's Happening" program on October 27th, detailing the alleged death of Russian President Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. According to Solovey, Putin died at his Valdai residence on Thursday, October 26th, around 9 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Solovey previously stated publicly "several times" that Vladimir Putin would not survive this fall and would likely die earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

## Attempts to Conceal Information

The speaker suggests that authorities "will try to hide" Putin's death, and are "already hiding" it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. Examples of deaths hidden in authoritarian regimes include:
*   Heydar Aliyev, Hugo Chavez, and Islam Karimov, whose deaths were allegedly concealed for three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   Zhirinovsky's death, which was reportedly hidden for a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

### Government Reactions to Dissemination

Since the announcement, a "wave of curses, insults, lies, and ridicule" has been directed at Solovey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. Additionally, there have been "several times" attempts to hack Solovey's accounts during the night of Thursday into Friday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

Solovey references Boris Yeltsin's terminology, stating that "the more refutations, the more lies and nevania on one topic, the faster the information... spreads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This information, according to Solovey, begins to spread and grow like a "snowball," involving new groups in the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. Solovey criticizes the government's handling of such information, suggesting that a smarter approach would be to ignore it, as their current actions serve to amplify the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. This discussion relates to [[russian_state_propaganda_and_its_influence | Russian state propaganda and its influence]] and [[impact_of_media_on_russian_society | impact of media on Russian society]].

### Use of a Double

The speaker suggests that concealing Putin's death is easier because a "double" (or "deuce" in professional jargon of the Federal Security Service and Presidential Security Service) has been "very successfully replaced" him for the last 2-3 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. This double can be used for a "short time," estimated at a maximum of two to three months, to manage the "transition to post-puncture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

## Expected Sociopolitical Development

The speaker predicts an attempt to maintain the status quo, meaning "no liberties and freedoms" and no reduction in military tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. There is a fear of public reaction, which could lead to "another tightening of the tightening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. This aligns with [[challenges_of_russian_society_and_propaganda | challenges of Russian society and propaganda]] and [[public_perception_and_potential_triggers_for_sociopolitical_change_in_Russia | public perception and potential triggers for sociopolitical change in Russia]].

A decision was allegedly made in October, when Putin was no longer able to negotiate a strong position with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Therefore, de-escalation is not expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

## Public Response and Future Outlook

Solovey expresses confidence, stating that "everything is not bad at all" despite the grim prognosis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. The speaker highlights that "we survived it," and being alive is a cause for joy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

Quoting Mikhail Gorbachev, Solovey states, "the process has started" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Putin's death has "torn the core out of the regime he created," causing it to begin to "avalanche" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. The regime cannot be saved under any circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. This points to potential [[public_discontent_and_political_dynamics_in_Russia | public discontent and political dynamics in Russia]].

Solovey emphasizes that a "window is beginning to open" for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. The future will "depend on us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. The speaker calls for individuals to "choose the right side of history" and fight for "freedom and justice for Russia and for changing our future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

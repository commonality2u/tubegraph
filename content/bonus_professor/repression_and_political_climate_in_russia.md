Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, in its twentieth episode recorded on the morning of July 11, discusses various aspects of the [[political_situation_in_russia | Russian political situation]], including potential mobilization, foreign policy, and internal repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02"></a>.

## Diplomatic Humiliation

The Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov, experienced a "public humiliation" at the G20 meeting on the island of Bali <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00"></a>. Lavrov's colleagues reportedly refused to participate in meetings, take pictures, or have dinner with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00"></a>. Journalists also showed no interest in the minister of a country claiming superpower status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00"></a>. This treatment is considered a humiliation not only for the Russian Foreign Ministry but for the Kremlin, Russian power, and Russia as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00"></a>. Such treatment of Russia's Foreign Minister is described as unprecedented in both Soviet and post-Soviet times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00"></a>.

## President Putin's Health and State of Mind

Observations of President Putin's speech to the leaders of the Duma factions suggest a concerning state of health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00"></a>. He is described as a "seriously ill person with cancer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00"></a>. While modern drugs can remove pain, speaking would be difficult under such circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00"></a>. During his speech, Putin was observed swaying his body and holding onto the table, indicating physical discomfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00"></a>.

The speaker emphasizes that the President's health and ability to adequately assess situations and make decisions directly impact the "fates and lives of millions of people" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00"></a>. This is seen as a matter of significant public concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00"></a>.

Putin's "sick consciousness" is noted to manifest as a return to "basic structures of thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00"></a>. His phrase regarding Ukraine, "we haven't even started yet," is compared to a teenager's threat, reflecting a potentially less sophisticated approach to serious matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00"></a>.

## Potential Mobilization and Public Reaction

The phrase "we haven't even started yet" is interpreted as a possible signal for a nationwide mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00"></a>. An urgent State Duma meeting was scheduled for July 15, potentially related to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00"></a>.

However, two main obstacles to immediate mobilization are identified:
*   **Image and Reputation**: Announcing mobilization contradicts the official narrative that the "special military operation" is going "according to plan" and winning with "little bloodshed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00"></a>.
*   **Risk of Political and Social Complications**: There is uncertainty about how society, especially those in large cities, would react to a nationwide mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00"></a>. A phased approach might involve introducing martial law in border regions with Ukraine first, to gauge public reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00"></a>. Announcing mobilization in summer is also seen as logistically challenging, as many potential conscripts are currently unreachable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00"></a>.

## Kremlin's Dislike for the British

The Kremlin reportedly dislikes the British deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00"></a>. This animosity is attributed to:
*   **Personal Reasons**: A deeply personal reason concerning President Putin, which the speaker declines to elaborate on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00"></a>.
*   **Corporate Affiliation**: Putin, as a former KGB officer, was traditionally trained in hostility towards the British, who were considered the main competitors of Soviet intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00"></a>. This hostility extends to the British political class and policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00"></a>. Britain is seen as a "spearman" behind serious intrigues against the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00"></a>.

Conversely, Germany is viewed differently, as German authorities are seen as not rushing to help Ukraine and prioritizing their own national interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00"></a>. Germany has reportedly blocked a 9 billion euro aid package from the European Union for Ukraine for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00"></a>.

## Secret Diplomacy for Ukrainian Conflict Resolution

The ongoing conflict in Ukraine is seen as dragging on without a clear strategic advantage for either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00"></a>. German reports suggest that Washington and key European allies are secretly discussing diplomatic ways to resolve the Ukrainian conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00"></a>. This indicates a desire to minimize or abandon force in favor of dialogue and negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00"></a>. However, the speaker believes a peaceful solution is difficult until a breakthrough occurs or until the parties are exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00"></a>. Ukraine, meanwhile, is preparing for a counter-offensive to retake southern territories, aiming to deploy a "million-strong army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00"></a>.

## Economic Measures and Historical Parallels

The Russian government has introduced a bill to allow the state to sell jewelry from the state repository abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:37:00"></a>. This move is seen as a way to mobilize resources amidst sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00"></a>. This action draws a historical parallel to the first years of Soviet power when Bolsheviks sold confiscated jewelry and even Hermitage paintings abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00"></a>.

## [[cultural_and_political_repression_in_russia | Repression and Political Commentary]]

To silence dissent, the Russian government is increasingly resorting to [[repressive_laws_and_political_commentary_in_russia | repression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00"></a>. A 19th-century joke, "call your son Arrest," which played on the popularity of the name and the meaning of "arrest," is now considered fully applicable to the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00"></a>.

A "wave of repressions" has begun against people wishing to participate in municipal deputy elections in Moscow, with strong candidates being persecuted to prevent their registration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00"></a>.

A notable case is that of Aleksey Gurianov, who received a 7-year sentence for using a single word prohibited in the Russian Federation (implied to be "war," used instead of "special military operation") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00"></a>. This is the first sentence in Russia for "discrediting the Russian army" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00"></a>. For comparison, Andrey Pivovarov, former director of Open Russia, faces a shorter term of 5 years for activities of an "undesirable organization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:00"></a>.

This [[discussion_of_repressive_practices_and_internal_politics_in_russia | "negative mobilization"]] includes arresting individuals who speak out, as well as high-profile cases like hockey player Ivan Fedotov, who was sent to serve in the north, and three other hockey players accused of illegally acquiring military tickets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00"></a>. These actions are seen as an "exemplary flogging" to prepare society for potential broader mobilization, demonstrating that "everyone will be equal before mobilization" regardless of fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00"></a>.

However, the government is not certain that society will react positively to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:24:00"></a>, and the speaker doubts that "half a million people will voluntarily run to military registration and enlistment offices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00"></a>.

The concept of "foreign agents" and the broader notion of foreign influence play a significant role in contemporary Russian legislation and political rhetoric. Valery Soloviev, a Doctor of Historical Sciences and political analyst, discusses these issues, drawing parallels with historical eras to explain current realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. He characterizes the current situation as a "medical accurate description of Russian reality," emphasizing "clinical madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Legal Restrictions and "Fakes"

Soloviev illustrates the severity of current Russian laws with a hypothetical scenario: if a divine figure were to preach in Moscow today, they would be instantly arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This is due to violations of two fundamental laws:
*   **Ban on Unauthorized Public Events** Any event can be deemed unauthorized by judicial decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Law on Fakes Against the Russian Armed Forces** Repeating the commandment "Do not kill" could be interpreted as a "fake" against the Russian armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Displaying a poster with this commandment can lead to immediate detention and accusation of spreading "fakes against the Russian armed forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Soloviev sarcastically suggests the State Duma might demand changes to Holy Scripture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Evolution of the "Foreign Agent" Law

The law on "foreign agents" has undergone significant changes, broadening its scope:
*   **Old Version** Accused those who received financial assistance from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Even a small transfer of 200 rubles could lead to being declared an agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **New Version** A person can be deemed a "foreign agent" if they are "under [[influence_and_interests_of_foreign_countries_in_russian_politics|foreign influence]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This broad definition means that "almost every citizen of the Russian Federation can turn out to be a candidate for foreign agent" simply by using foreign languages at school, university, or for professional or entertainment purposes, as this constitutes being "under [[influence_and_interests_of_foreign_countries_in_russian_politics|foreign influence]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Family Members of Agents** A proposed new category includes family members of foreign agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This harkens back to the Stalin era's "families of traitors" formulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The implication is that even those dissatisfied with the government, or who do not have an "enthusiastic enough facial expression," could be targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. A person was reportedly fined in Siberia for merely expressing approval of a peace advocacy event with their facial expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

## The Concept of "Enemies of the People"

The reasons for this "clinical madness" are rooted in the military-political reality, specifically Russia's "special military operation" in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. As achieving military goals becomes increasingly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, and the morale of the armed forces declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, the idea of "victory" becomes an "illusory distance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This leads to the question of who is to blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The speaker asserts that the Supreme Commander-in-Chief (referring to Vladimir Putin) cannot be blamed, drawing another parallel to Stalin, who was "never wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

Soloviev states that the "Stalin era is coming to life," and the answer to who is to blame is "enemies of the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. President Putin's statements to the Prosecutor General's Office reinforce this narrative:
*   The West's "primary task is to split Russian society [and] destroy the country from within" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   "Fakes and calls for illegal actions are often organized from abroad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

This leads to two categories of "enemies of the people" in the modern context, typically associated with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>:
1.  **Foreign agents** who cause "information damage" by spreading "fakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
2.  **Outright terrorists and saboteurs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## Historical Parallels and Justifications

Soloviev argues that the current approach combines historical experiences from two different countries and eras:

### Weimar Germany (1920s-1930s)
The first experience is borrowed from pre-Nazi Germany, where the idea was popular that Germany lost WWI not on the battlefield but because it was "stabbed in the back" by "moral decay and national traitors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. In modern Russia, "foreign agents" are seen as these "moral decay traitors" who try to "stick a knife in the back of society" and the armed forces through "fakes and decomposition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This interpretation in modern Russia is more generalizing and broad than in Weimar Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

### Stalin's Russia
The second experience is from Stalin's Russia, particularly the idea that opposition leads to "direct terrorist activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. This logic determined the "infamous Moscow trials" of 1936-1938 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Defendants in these trials "admitted" to killing figures and preparing assassinations on behalf of foreign intelligence agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

Soloviev draws a direct parallel:
*   In 1938, the Moscow trial exposed those who "allegedly killed" Maxim Gorky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   In 2022, President Putin reported the capture of "neo-Nazis" who were "allegedly preparing the murder of TV presenter Vladimir Solovyov on the instructions of the Ukrainian security service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   Soloviev notes a "roll call of eras," although the targets may be less prominent, sarcastically stating, "the pipe is lower, the smoke is thinner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Soloviev predicts that the next theoretical step will be the organization of "public trials" in Russia against "foreign agents" who have "embarked on the path of terrorist activity," transitioning from disseminating "fakes" to direct action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. He notes that the number of "fakes" is counted in the "millions" by the Prosecutor General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

He emphasizes that Russia is a country where "one historical tragedy repeats itself as a second tragedy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>, and that "we are only at the beginning of this process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. The peak of the fight against "moral terrorists" and the exposure of "national traitors" and "agents" is still ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

Despite the difficult situation for those who remain in Russia, especially those with "moral sense" and "dignity," Soloviev offers a "ray of light" that this period "will not last long" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. He encourages support for those who "raise their voices in defense of human dignity, common sense and ordinary... moral values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.

The armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine has become the "main nerve" of [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45"></a>. Any discussion of [[russian_political_landscape_and_potential_changes | Russian politics]] inevitably centers on this conflict as the dominant factor of current and future events in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50"></a>. As of April 18, 2022, the conflict appears to be approaching a culmination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11"></a>.

## Reasons for Approaching Culmination

From the Russian side, it is evident that the [[kremlin_internal_political_dynamics | Kremlin]] has not achieved any of its combat missions or the political goals set at the campaign's outset against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27"></a>. Unexplained events, like the death of the cruiser Varyag, combined with vague public hints and the lack of official mourning or disclosure of casualties, create a "painful impression" and call into question the effectiveness of the "limited special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07"></a>. The [[russian_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Russian leadership]] clearly needs a strategic turning point on the fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17"></a>.

Conversely, Ukraine and its leadership, supported by the West, refuse to meet Russia's ultimatum demands and believe they can inflict significant damage, if not defeat, on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01"></a>. This situation points towards an imminent, fierce confrontation, likely the "Battle of Donbass," which is considered a key event by all parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51"></a>. However, information from the most senior [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | Russian military]] figures suggests a lack of confidence in victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09"></a>.

## High Risk of Escalation

The risk of escalation is very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38"></a>. If the [[kremlin_internal_political_dynamics | Kremlin]] fails to achieve its combat missions and political goals—specifically, forcing Ukraine to sign a peace treaty on favorable terms—the risks of using weapons of mass destruction, including low-yield tactical nuclear weapons, increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18"></a>. This possibility is consistently discussed among military and intelligence circles in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48"></a>. Weapons of mass destruction also include chemical and bacteriological weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12"></a>.

There are concerns within [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russia]] that Ukraine's effective resistance is largely due to Western arms supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00"></a>. This raises the temptation to disrupt these logistical chains, possibly through tactical nuclear strikes on Ukrainian or neighboring territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25"></a>.

Another potential escalation mechanism involves strikes by the opposing side on military and civilian targets within the [[domestic_russian_political_dynamics | Russian Federation]], particularly in regions adjacent to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03"></a>. The possibility of Ukraine receiving missiles capable of reaching [[russian_political_landscape_and_potential_changes | Russian military]] airfields is also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13"></a>.

Finally, terrorist attacks in Moscow and other large [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian cities]] are a possible trigger for escalation, with subtle hints appearing in official [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian media]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38"></a>.

The world is currently in a situation reminiscent of, or even more acute than, the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34"></a>.

## Possible Outcomes of the Confrontation

Assuming the most dangerous escalation is avoided, three possibilities for future developments exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01"></a>:

1.  **Peace Treaty**: This option seems unlikely given the current positions of both the Ukrainian and [[domestic_russian_political_dynamics | Russian sides]], as [[russia_s_internal_political_dynamics_and_changes | Russia's]] demands are "absolutely unrealizable" for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22"></a>.
2.  **Truce**: A cessation of hostilities, either partial or full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38"></a>.
3.  **Continuation of Sluggish Military Actions (Positional Battles)**: This could occur under the guise of a truce or even without an announcement, following the military culmination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54"></a>. This state could last for a considerable time, potentially until the fall of 2022 or even until the end of the year, according to American sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17"></a>.

## Internal Scapegoating and Purges

When a project or expectations fail, blame typically falls on subordinates rather than the leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40"></a>. The failure to implement the initial concept of the "limited military operation" is being attributed to individuals close to the president who provided misleading information or instilled false hope that Ukraine would "collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02"></a>.

Those implicated include:
*   Minister of Defense Shoigu, who has fallen into disgrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09"></a>.
*   The former head of the 5th Service of the FSB, responsible for operational information on Ukraine and behind-the-scenes preparations for the Russian troops' arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26"></a>. This service provided most of the "bravura reports" to Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37"></a>. The head of this service is reportedly in a pre-trial detention center and subjected to physical abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51"></a>. A group of officers from the department are also giving confessions under duress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12"></a>.
*   Problems are also noted in the Main Directorate of the General Staff (former GRU), which is military intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24"></a>.

Despite widespread reports, there is no "conspiracy against Putin" or "split in the elite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48"></a>. Instead, there is increasing tension and disorganization within the security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56"></a>. A "purge" is expected once the "special military operation" concludes, regardless of its outcome, leading to the naming and punishment of culprits in the "Russian manner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16"></a>.

## Economic and Elite Pressures

Tension and disorganization will also increase among the top bureaucracy and big business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34"></a>. Reasons for this include:
*   The impending purge, described as "settling the score" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42"></a>.
*   Strengthening sanctions from the West, which will become increasingly sensitive and difficult for the [[russias_internal_political_dynamics_and_changes | Russian economy]], leading to technological degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13"></a>.
*   The confiscation of [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian oligarchs']] assets by Western nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28"></a>.
*   Revived discussions within the [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian security]] environment about the nationalization of large private assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45"></a>.

## Signs of "Dukhatization" and the End of an Era

There are "barely noticeable signs of the dukhatization [demoralization/demobilization of spirit]" within the security forces, characterized by fears and confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17"></a>. The highest elites are confused and do not know how to escape the worsening situation, anticipating a "very sad outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33"></a>.

This situation is compared to the Russian Empire in 1916, where it took three years from the start of World War I to reach a state of dukhatization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08"></a>. It is suggested that [[russia_s_internal_political_dynamics_and_changes | Russia]] will reach this point much faster now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14"></a>. While the authorities are attempting to prevent this process by "tightening the screws," the underlying structure is "rusty" and "rotten," risking its collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42"></a>.

Although the structure of the [[russian_political_dynamics_amidst_leadership_changes | Russian government]] is not yet crumbling, there is a mass feeling of exhaustion of the historical time known as the "Putin era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09"></a>. This era is coming to an end, and it is highly likely that this end will not be triumphant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20"></a>.

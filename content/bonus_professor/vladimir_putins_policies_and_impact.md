## Overview of Public Statements
In December 2022, the Russian president made public statements that were described as internally contradictory and indicative of a "pathologically sick consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Despite the perceived contradictions, the speaker noted that for [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin]] himself, "everything is really going according to plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Key statements by [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin]] included:
*   "Everything is going according to plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   "There will be no mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, a statement made twice in the preceding week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. However, this was qualified with "at the moment there is no need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
*   Regarding nuclear weapons, [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin]] stated Russia was "not ready to be the first to use them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, or rather, did "not intend to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Simultaneously, the speaker noted a discussion around preventive strike concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

These statements were perceived by the West as a readiness by the Russian president to use nuclear force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Economic Impact of Policies
Official statements about the nuclear shield being "in perfect order" were deemed not to correspond to reality, given the general state of affairs in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Economic forecasts, particularly unofficial ones, have become "gloomier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

*   **GDP Decline**: Alfa Bank economists predicted that Russia's GDP in 2023 would decrease by 6.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the Central Bank's forecast of a 2.0-2.1% fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> and the Ministry of Economic Development's projection of less than 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. If Alfa Bank's forecast is accurate, it would mark the largest GDP fall in Russia since 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Nature of the Crisis**: According to these economists, the current crisis has a different nature, and a quick recovery is not expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> due to:
    *   Decreased domestic demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
    *   Export restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
    *   Decline in investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Employment**: By the beginning of summer 2022, 13% of Russia's working-age population (4.3 million people) were on unpaid, partially paid leave, or idle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This represents a "negative increase in employment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, highlighting a dangerous trend in unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## Social and Demographic Impact
The speaker raised the question of how [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin]] fulfills the "testament of the Great Elder" to "save the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, referencing Alexander Solzhenitsyn's idea that the main task of Russian authorities should be to save the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

*   **Birth Rate Decline**: In October 2022, the birth rate in Russia fell by 11% compared to the previous October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Population Decrease**: The population has decreased by half a million people since the beginning of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Social Degradation**: It is argued that Russian society is degrading in social and anthropological senses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The implied ideal is for Russia to become a "land free of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, ruled by an elite with 25-30 million "servants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>, an ideal being realized.

## [[the_political_climate_in_russia_and_government_policies | Political Climate in Russia]] and Government Policies
Internal Kremlin-ordered focus groups among "Turbo Patriots" revealed significant shifts in mood between July and November 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. After a series of military defeats, including the loss of Kherson, even these patriots are "disappointed in the army [and] in [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Many are now willing to sacrifice new territories for peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This indicates that the situation in the country is changing for the worse for the authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

*   **[[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin's Popularity]]**: [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin's]] popularity is at "record lows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, and societal discontent is increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This is cited as a reason for [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin's]] repeated assurances that there will be no mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   **Government Approach**: The government's strategy to cope with this discontent is described as "sitting on bayonets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This is reflected in the federal budget for 2023-25, signed by [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>:
    *   Expected tax collection decrease by 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
    *   Oil and gas budget revenues to decrease by 24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
    *   Sharp reduction in spending on economic support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
    *   Record jump in financing for "unarmed forces" (police, National Guard, FSB, Federal Protective Service) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
    *   "Every third ruble will go to the security forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>, with a quarter of the budget classified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

It is asserted that "sitting on bayonets" can only be sustained for "a very, very short time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## Behavior of the Russian Establishment
Changes in the behavior of the Russian establishment, particularly officials, have been observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. These include:
*   Increased alcohol consumption among officials, starting with breakfast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. This is seen as a way to "forget about the terrible present" and "even more terrible prospects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
*   [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | President Putin]] himself has expressed "great dissatisfaction" with officials' increased drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>, as he is known to have a "very moderate attitude to alcohol" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   Rumors indicate Russian officials are "actively looking for a second homeland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>, a place to "lie low after the regime collapses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. While Latin America is discussed, it is deemed unsafe due to predominant US influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. Africa is identified as a more realistic location for "alternate airfields" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a> for the elite, including luxury housing, material reserves, currency, precious metals, and protection (e.g., Wagner Group) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.

## Outlook
The overall situation for the Russian authorities is largely described as "hopeless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. They can no longer count on a military victory, public support, or a "total struggle for minds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>, and there is "nowhere to run" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>.

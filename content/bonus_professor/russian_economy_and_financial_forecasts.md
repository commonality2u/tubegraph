This article provides an overview of the [[russian_economic_and_financial_outlook | Russian economic and financial outlook]], including forecasts for inflation, currency exchange rates, and potential financial measures, based on recent discussions.

## Current Economic Climate and Inflation
Contrary to official statements, the accumulated inflation in Russia over three years from 2012 to the end of 2015 was around 28-29% officially, but alternative calculations suggest it was no less than 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. It is predicted that the rate of price growth will accelerate and become higher in the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

## Currency Forecasts
Estimates from the Central Bank management predicted the dollar exchange rate at 120 rubles by late autumn/early winter of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. For the first half of the next year, they project 150 rubles per dollar, with a possibility of reaching 200 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

Due to Russia's reliance on imported components in almost all sectors, a significant increase in prices is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

### Advice on Currency Purchases
If individuals have money to buy currency, they should consider purchasing euros or newer US dollar bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Older US dollar bills (referred to as "cheeseball") are accepted in the United States and European countries but often not in places like the Emirates or Turkey, where many Russians travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

## Potential Financial Measures
### Freezing Deposits
There is discussion about the possibility of freezing deposits. If implemented, conditions might be introduced to avoid touching amounts up to 1,400 units, which could gain public support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. Although this idea has been postponed until spring/summer, circumstances could lead to an earlier implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

Further details on deposit freezing and denomination will be shared via a Telegram channel, noting that several projects are competing, and a common view is not yet established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>.

### Foreign Funds and Investors
The notion that all frozen Russian funds will be forcibly transferred to a digital ruble is false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. There are no such plans currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.

Regarding foreign investors, efforts are underway to prevent extreme measures against them, acknowledging it is an ongoing struggle that sometimes requires compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.

### Cryptocurrency and Sanctions
The Russian authorities are not preparing to arrest or confiscate cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. This is because they widely use cryptocurrency as one of the few remaining tools to circumvent sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>. All cryptocurrency exchanges are reportedly under the control of the FSB, with all transactions recorded, especially those exceeding $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>.

## Economic Outlook and Challenges
The year 2025 is predicted to be harder for Russia than the outgoing year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. While 2026 is hoped to be easier, this remains to be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

There will be "very difficult but frankly bad times" ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>.

### Access to Putin's Piggy Bank
Access to "Putin's piggy bank" is believed to be closed or lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. If a new leadership came to power, directing part of these resources towards the [[russian_economic_crisis_and_forecasts | country's exit from the crisis]] would be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. However, it is suggested that if the current speaker's group came to power, no such piggy bank would be needed, as their prospects would be "terrifying" in a different sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.

### Other Financial Considerations
*   Bookmakers are expected to survive any deposit freezing or cash withdrawal limits, as they generate "colossal profits" and are not targeted by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:46">[00:49:46]</a>.
*   Bans on leaving the Russian Federation imposed by the bailiff service are expected to be lifted for many citizens, as tax and other amnesties will be carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

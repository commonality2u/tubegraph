This article discusses the Western ultimatum presented to Russian President Vladimir Putin and the anticipated responses from Russia, as analyzed by Valery Solovey on February 19, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Munich Conference: A Crusade Against Putin

According to Valery Solovey, the Munich conference effectively declared a "crusade against Mr. Putin personally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The core message from the West emphasized two main points:
*   The West is deliberately aiming to inflict military defeat on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> and to strip it of all territorial gains in Ukraine, including the Crimean Peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   No threats from Putin or Russia, including the use of nuclear weapons, will deter the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

It is suggested that the West is intentionally provoking Putin to react harshly, possibly to incite his inner circle to take decisive action and prevent "inadequate actions" by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This represents a form of [[western_pressure_on_russian_elites | Western pressure on Russian elites]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## [[chinas_stance_on_russias_oil_export_and_military_strategy | China's Stance]]

China's position, as expressed at the Munich conference, is seen as ambiguous yet indicative of a slow drift towards the Western coalition's stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   While China opposes unilateral sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, its representative insisted on peace and is ready to present a "Peace Plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   This plan is reportedly based on respect for the sovereignty of both parties, which implies Russia must renounce its territorial claims from Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   The intent to present this plan soon suggests that China does not believe in the possibility of a Russian Federation victory or in President Putin's strategic genius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   A meeting between Xi Jinping and Putin was made conditional on Russia achieving a decisive victory or pursuing peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>; the first option is now seen as "crossed out" by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Putin's Anticipated Response to the [[western_countries_stance_towards_russias_leadership | Western Ultimatum]]

Putin is expected to deliver both a verbal and a practical (military) response to what is perceived as a [[western_countries_stance_towards_russias_leadership | Western ultimatum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. A military defeat would have "immediate political conclusions" for Putin's personal destiny and the political regime he created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

### Verbal Response: The Federal Assembly Message

A verbal response is anticipated in Putin's message to the Federal Assembly on February 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Traditionally, the Kremlin inflates the information agenda before such addresses, leading to speculation about "fateful decisions" and "sharp turns in policy" that often turn out to be "information bubbles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Three potential options for the message are considered, based on their degree of radicalism:

*   **Horror-Horror (Most Radical)**:
    *   Declaration of a "people's war" on NATO, to the "last Russian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
    *   Declaration of general mobilization and martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
    *   Currently, there are no signs of this option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, as Putin himself is reportedly afraid of such a radical choice, having personal experience from February 24 last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

*   **Just Horror (Mid-Radical)**:
    *   Announcement of new "victories" to compensate for military failures in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
    *   Discussions include the potential inclusion of South Ossetia and Abkhazia into Russia, and the declaration of independence of Transnistria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
    *   This is seen as a propaganda move to portray "outstanding victory" and suggest the "Soviet Union has begun to successfully recover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
    *   However, such propaganda messages are unlikely to be taken seriously by even "deceived Russians," who may not know the locations or significance of these regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

*   **Usual Nonsense (Least Radical)**:
    *   Characterized by many threats and hints, typical of Russian high-style politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
    *   No single decisive action will be announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
    *   Putin might "throw a pebble into a pond" to gauge public reaction before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.
    *   This is considered the most likely option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

The final decision on which option to choose is expected to be made just hours before the proclamation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

### Practical Response: A New Offensive

The practical part of Putin's response is expected to be a new military offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
*   This offensive must be carried out quickly and succeed before Ukraine receives advanced Western weapons, which are capable of significantly increasing Russian losses and are considered key to a Ukrainian counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   However, the Russian military is reluctant to go on the offensive, believing it would be a "big mistake" and that there is "practically no chance of success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This indicates a low morale and psychological state within the Russian armed forces and command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.
*   There is an acute shortage of advanced weapons in the Russian armed forces, relying on remnants of Soviet weapons, while Ukraine receives modern Western armaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

#### Mobilization Efforts

To compensate for the deficit of advanced weapons, Russia considers mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Putin reportedly wishes to announce a new mobilization, and organizational and technical preparations are underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.
*   The mobilization is ongoing in a "sluggish form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   It has not acquired a massive, open form for two reasons:
    1.  Inability to produce the required quantity of uniforms completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
    2.  Putin's fear, despite reports of successful partial mobilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. He prefers everything to be unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

## Allies and Internal Challenges

*   **Lukashenko's Disbelief**: Even Putin's closest ally, Alexander Lukashenko, demonstrates "completely obvious disbelief" in Russia's strategic talents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. Lukashenko was observed "openly trolling" the Russian president during a meeting on February 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. This indicates a different balance of power, where Putin lacks drive and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
*   **Military Sabotage**: The reluctance of the Russian command staff to go on the offensive may develop into actual sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

## [[potential_consequences_of_putin_accepting_or_rejecting_the_ultimatum | Risk of Nuclear Weapons Use]]

If Putin cannot afford defeat, the speaker suggests he might reach for the "nuclear baton" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.
*   Both Chinese comrades and the West have made it clear they are not afraid of its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.
*   Even if the threat of using such a weapon is estimated at only two to three percent, this is considered "colossal" and unprecedented since the Cuban missile crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.
*   Putin is psychologically and morally ready for this, but hope remains that he will not be able to implement such a decision, even if an order is given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

## Other Mentions

### Seymour Hersh Revelations
The revelations by Pulitzer Prize winner Seymour Hersh regarding the explosion of the Northern Streams are mentioned but dismissed as having "absolutely no relation" to the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. It is suggested that Hersh was "played blind," possibly due to "dementia state and the tendency to conspiracy theories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>. The source of his information is noted as non-Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

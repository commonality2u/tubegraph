This article, based on a program recorded on Sunday, June 5, 2022, delves into the sustainability of the Russian economy amidst ongoing international sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Sanctions Against Russia

The European Union has continued to impose new sanctions against the Russian Federation, including the 6th package of sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. A primary focus of this package is sanctions against Russian oil and oil products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. In 2021, EU countries imported nearly 71 billion euros worth of oil and oil products from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. It is estimated that almost 65 billion euros of this volume will be lost due to the sanctions by the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

## [[Impact and adaptation to international sanctions on Russia | Economic Impact and Adaptation]]

While the sanctions appear formidable and threatening to the [[Economic Conditions in Russia | Russian economy]], they may not be "deadly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Russia is expected to compensate for some lost exports to Europe by reorienting sales to China and India, potentially up to 40% of the volume previously intended for Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

### Bypass Strategies for Oil Sanctions

Russia is employing various strategies to bypass the [[Effects and management of sanctions on Russia | impact of sanctions]] on its oil exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>:
*   **Mixing Oil:** If a tanker contains only 49% Russian oil, mixed with oil from another source, it is formally no longer considered Russian oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Insurance Circumvention:** Refusal to insure tankers can also be bypassed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Discounted Sales:** Given high oil prices globally, Russia can sell at a lower price to maintain export volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

It is believed that Russian exports will not suffer significantly, at least initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## [[Russian oligarchs and sanctions | Personal Sanctions]]

While economic sanctions on oil may be circumvented, personal sanctions are proving difficult to bypass and are highly irritating to the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. These sanctions target not only [[russian_oligarchs_and_sanctions | Russian oligarchs]] but also their spouses and children, who are affected by travel restrictions and asset freezes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. The West has made it clear that these sanctions will be difficult to bypass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## Longer-Term [[Impacts of war and sanctions on Russia | Economic Outlook]]

Experts believe that sanctions will work more effectively in the long term, though perhaps not immediately proving "deadly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. However, officials and businessmen integrated into the real economy are anticipating serious problems, referring to August as a "fatal month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. While the exact nature of these problems is unclear, they could involve:
*   A financial sphere crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   A powerful cyberattack on the Russian banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   An international economic crisis affecting Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

There is a prevalent "unpleasant feeling" among these individuals about the end of summer, suggesting it could be "extremely alarming and even unpleasant" in financial and economic relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Despite official reassurances that the [[economic_conditions_in_russia | economy]] has adapted and is stable, there are "vague doubts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.

## Political Factors and the Economy

A potential political factor that could influence the [[Economic Conditions in Russia | economy]] is the deteriorating health of the Russian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Among Moscow and high-echelon federal officials, the idea that Putin will eventually have to leave is considered common knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This uncertainty is leading to disorganization within the administrative apparatus, as officials question the risks of taking action when a change in leadership is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This sentiment is compared to the disorganization observed in Soviet offices before the collapse of the Soviet Union due to uncertainty about the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

Officials may also be focused on personal and group tasks, potentially engaging in a "last grab" of resources before anticipated changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. There is a sense that something significant is happening behind the scenes, which is being hidden from the public through the use of doubles, augmented reality for video messages, and pre-recorded meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. The prevailing belief is that the "Putin system" cannot exist without Putin, and his weakening would lead to the system's disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

The summer of 2022 is expected to lead to a "very interesting outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

The Kremlin has achieved a degree of success in its foreign policy, particularly concerning European politics, by attempting to divide "old Europe" from "new Europe" and pit them against the "Anglo-Saxon bloc" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. "Old Europe" is defined as Germany, France, and Italy, while "new Europe" is led by Poland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The "Anglo-Saxon bloc" refers to the alliance between [[uk_and_russian_relations | Great Britain]] and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Kremlin's Diplomatic Levers

The relative success of Russia's foreign policy maneuvers is attributed to several factors:

### Incriminating Materials (Kompromat)
Moscow allegedly possesses compromising information on a number of European politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. While not necessarily first-line figures, these individuals can influence foreign policy decisions in their respective countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Bulgarian investigator Christo Grozev reportedly promised to publish the names of 600 European politicians who received support from the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Economic and Demographic Blackmail
Russia uses economic and demographic arguments to influence [[european_values_and_their_relevance_to_russia | European countries]]. Moscow warns that continued conflict will lead to an increased influx of Ukrainian refugees into Europe, straining budgets and social services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Additionally, Russia suggests that current policies could lead to a global famine, causing refugees from North Africa and the Middle East to migrate to Europe, particularly Italy, Germany, and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This tactic plays on the memory of the large migration crisis of 2015-2018, which remains a concern for European governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Calls for Peace and Russian Interpretations
The statement by Henry Kissinger, urging Ukraine to negotiate with Russia, is seen as indicative of Moscow's attempts to activate its agents of influence globally, not just in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Kissinger, a proponent of realpolitik and focused on interests rather than values, is considered close to [[russian_diplomacy_and_international_relations | Russian foreign policy]] thinking, having met with Putin numerous times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

A conversation between Putin, Scholz, and Macron on Saturday reportedly revealed Russia's readiness for "peace," contingent on the lifting of sanctions in exchange for food supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

However, the understanding of "peace" differs significantly:
*   **European interpretation**: For France and Germany, a peace agreement entails Russia withdrawing its troops to pre-February 24 positions, ceasing fire, and then making peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Kremlin's interpretation**: Russia seeks a truce or ceasefire to regroup forces, bring in new contingents, and secure military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The Kremlin is "categorically not interested" in returning troops to pre-operation positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Such a step would be exclusively in the Kremlin's interest, allowing it to strengthen positions in the territories it controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Russia refers to these controlled territories as "liberated territories" and is preparing for their integration into the Russian Federation, potentially through referendums or direct annexation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This would legitimize a new territorial status beneficial to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

Ukraine also needs a pause to receive promised weapons, achieve technical superiority, and train personnel for a potential strategic counteroffensive, which is unlikely before late summer or early autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. In newly integrated territories, Russia prioritizes the introduction of Russian mobile operators and large TV panels for "brainwashing," considering it more important than restoring housing or material goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Resource Depletion and Information Operations
The issue of resource exhaustion is evident in Russia, indicated by the abolition of the age limit for signing military contracts and the un-mothballing of outdated T-62 tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Reports from Dagestan suggest forced recruitment for military registration and enlistment offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Western intelligence services are reportedly conducting an information operation by leaking details about Putin's health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. Despite the actual state of Putin's health, this information flow aims to influence the [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian establishment]], particularly the middle class and those distant from the Kremlin's inner circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. The message conveyed is that "Putin is no longer the guarantor of the system," and his promises should not be relied upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. This is reminiscent of a previous information operation where Western intelligence, through media like Bloomberg, reported on Russia's impending large-scale military operation against Ukraine, aiming to delay or disrupt the attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. Putin is known to dislike predictability, which such leaks exploit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

The Kremlin attempts to conceal the true state of affairs through "canned food" (pre-recorded video appearances of the president) and the strategic use of doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. It is claimed that a double appeared at a military hospital visit, and that Putin has been using doubles for years, preparing them for a time when he may be unable to appear publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>.

## Internal Purges and Opposition
A purge within the FSB is ongoing, affecting the 5th service (responsible for analytical intelligence supporting the special military operation against Ukraine) and now the central office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. This purge is expected to impact the FSB's internal policy, particularly concerning [[influence_of_international_relations_on_russian_politics | Russian society]] and the [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian opposition]], as it affects the 2nd service, which combats political extremism and protects constitutional order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. The liberal opposition in Russia is seen as "completely defeated," with remnants either imprisoned, silent, or having left the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

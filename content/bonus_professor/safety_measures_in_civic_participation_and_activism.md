The principle of safety is paramount for individuals engaged in civic participation and activism in Russia, particularly for uninvolved people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This emphasis on safety is a core principle for groups working on socially significant projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

## Feasible and Safe Participation

When seeking assistance for these projects, the advice given is to "do what is safe for you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Individuals are encouraged to engage in forms of [[public_engagement_and_activism_in_russias_political_landscape | civic activism]] that are both feasible and safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

Examples of safe participation include:
*   Subscribing to Telegram channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This is considered "absolutely safe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   Providing small financial assistance through indicated details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. This is also deemed "absolutely safe" and does not threaten individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.

These actions represent minimal, yet significant, efforts that people can safely undertake in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

> "The little that you can do in Russia now is precisely observing and safely." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>

## Overcoming Fear

While acknowledging that public cowardice is largely a result of state policy, it is stressed that even when safe actions are possible – such as speaking out or supporting each other – people may still be afraid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. The argument is made that external entities, like the Americans, should not be expected to solve internal problems if the populace is unwilling to act, use their intellect, or show solidarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

The call to action is for individuals to make "at least a tiny, modest effort" through the available safe forms of participation to contribute to the end of the dictatorship and the liberation of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:25">[00:44:25]</a>.

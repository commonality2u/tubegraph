Russia is experiencing a deterioration of its situation, moving "from bad to worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This decline is evident across various aspects, including its international standing, military capabilities, and domestic [[economic_challenges_in_russia | economic challenges]].

## SCO Summit: An Economic and Geopolitical "Failure"

The Samarkand summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) in Uzbekistan is described as a "failure" for Russia in several aspects, including economic and geopolitical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Economic Aspect
At the summit, Russia's president had "nothing to offer" participants beyond resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. China and India are identified as the main consumers of these resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. A proposal to build the "Power of Siberia 2" gas pipeline, stretching from the Yamal Peninsula through Mongolia to China, was reportedly met with an "ironic" rejection from China, which "has no need for this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

### Geopolitical Aspect
The summit highlighted China and Turkey as the "true masters" of the region, successfully developing the post-Soviet space traditionally considered Russia's "undivided" sphere of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. China's leader publicly stated that China is the guarantor of "sovereignty and territorial integrity" of Kazakhstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Kazakhstan's president demonstratively avoided communication with Russia's president at the summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

Central Asian countries, traditionally clients of the Russian Federation, are now behaving "insolently" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) is expected to "inevitably collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>, with Kazakhstan reportedly suspending its membership next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Military and Mobilization Challenges

The Russian army faces significant shortcomings, lacking "forces and means," "people," and "equipment," especially modern equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. More critically, there is a "lack of moral and volitional qualities," no "faith in Victory," and no "understanding of the meaning of what is happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This deficit is growing and can lead to "failure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This lack of morale extends to the civilian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

### Strategy of Using Penal Battalions
Following setbacks, particularly the "Kharkov defeat," the idea of using prisoners in "penal companies and penal battalions" emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. This is seen as an "admission that the Russian Federation cannot or does not want to carry out mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. It's noted that penal battalions "Never and nowhere could win a single war" and are not a "Decisive force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

### Resistance to Mobilization
Two "key security officers," Patrushev and Bortnikov, reportedly spoke out "against mobilization" in a "harsh manner," including against a "partial" or "limited mobilization" that the President discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. These are the same individuals who, in the spring, developed a mobilization plan and reported its feasibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Their objection is seen as a reaction to the "political and physiological weakening of the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

## Political and [[economic_and_political_challenges_in_russia | Economic Challenges]] Outlook

The Russian elite is increasingly grappling with how to extract itself from the current situation, ideally while "saving face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Ukraine's insistence on the "complete liberation of all Ukrainian territories, including Crimea," is "absolutely unacceptable" for the Russian leadership as it would mean "recognition of a complete and final fiasco" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

The United States has withdrawn from "closed consultations" with Russia regarding ending military actions and peace treaties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>. A consensus has formed in the U.S. to "inflict on Russia a decisive military defeat" to achieve "political Change in the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.

It is predicted that "time has begun to speed up" in Russia, with changes happening "extremely quickly" and affecting "everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:54">[00:24:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. The "drama and speed of these changes will increase" this fall, resulting in a "sharp deterioration" that will affect "socio-economic" and "political" spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. The economy is described as already experiencing difficulties, with "financiers already singing romantics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>.

This article summarizes developments and predictions regarding the [[current_phase_of_the_russian_ukraine_conflict | military conflict]] between Russia and Ukraine as of November 16, 2022. It is based on the 38th episode of Valery Solovyov's program "What's Happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Rejection of Peace Proposal and Initial Escalation

The Kremlin's reaction to a [[potential_peace_proposals_between_russia_and_ukraine | Peace Proposal]] was determined by whether it would launch massive missile strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. On Tuesday, November 15, an unprecedentedly large-scale strike was launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This indicates that the Kremlin, specifically President Putin, rejected the [[potential_peace_proposals_between_russia_and_ukraine | Peace Proposal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

A tragic incident in Poland, where missiles hit and killed two Poles, is currently under investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. It is unlikely to become a *casus belli* or lead to NATO activating Article 5, as no one in NATO appears interested in its activation at this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

The recent events signify not just a continuation but an escalation of [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | military action]], moving into a new, more dangerous phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. President Putin has adopted a strategy of "spearhead counter-escalation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Implications for Ukraine

Following Russia's categorical rejection of [[potential_peace_proposals_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace proposals]], Ukraine is expected to receive new weapons, including long-range ammunition and missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This means Ukraine's armed forces will have the capability to target not only border regions but also areas deeper within Russia, potentially Central Russia, with this radius expanding over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Evidence of this potential includes:
*   Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council, was sent to inspect air defense systems in Central Russia, ostensibly for readiness against new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   The undermining of the steel key oil depot in the Varlovskaya region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   Reports (as of 12:23 PM Moscow time on November 16) of Ukrainian troops launching an offensive near Popasnaya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Implications for Russia

### Military Actions and Mobilization
Russia is expected to continue massive shelling, provided it has sufficient missiles or receives them from its strategic ally in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. However, a large-scale offensive or counteroffensive by Russian armed forces in Ukraine is unlikely, as Russia has adopted a concept of strategic defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. This defense relies on protective contingents and mobilized forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Despite the president's announcement that mobilization was over, the relevant regulatory document has not been submitted, allowing military registration offices to continue issuing call-up messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. A second stage of mobilization is reportedly scheduled for after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. If Ukrainian offensives are successful, this second stage may be expedited, and already mobilized personnel undergoing training could be sent to the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Internal Conditions and Restrictions
Escalation could lead to further restrictions on civil liberties in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Martial law, currently applied in the "new territories" of Ukraine, may be extended to Russian regions bordering Ukraine, and potentially to major Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

If martial law is introduced, authorities may:
*   Introduce curfews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   Gain the ability to detain citizens without trial for 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   Confiscate property from citizens and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
The economy is also expected to undergo further "non-stateization" and mobilization, with an estimated 40% already linked to the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### Political Stability
Putin's popularity is rapidly declining according to closed polls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. While protest moods are not growing as rapidly, they are increasing, prompting authorities to "tighten the screws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This tightening risks collapsing the already fragile structure of Russian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. The [[militarypolitical_situation_in_russia_and_ukraine | military crisis]] Russia is involved in is predicted to inevitably evolve into a large-scale political crisis, potentially leading to the collapse of Russian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

## Wider Conflict Implications

Escalation is not excluded and could involve NATO countries most actively helping Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. While direct military confrontation with the United States is not anticipated, symmetrical strikes on these countries or cyber attacks are possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The [[ukraine_russia_conflict | conflict]] zone could expand, including strikes on logistics hubs through sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

President Putin's personal strategy is based on the conviction that escalation, or raising the stakes, is the only way to compel the West to retreat and pressure Ukraine into signing a peace agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. However, this is unlikely to happen, as the West intends to increase pressure on Russia through Ukraine and other means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Russia, based on its combined power, is seen as unable to withstand the pressure of the consolidated West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

The ultimate "last argument" for Russia could be the use of [[military_and_nuclear_concerns_regarding_ukraine_and_russia | tactical nuclear weapons]], an idea currently on hold but not taboo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

## Historical Parallels and Future Outlook

The current [[russianukrainian_relations_and_the_prospect_of_war | military crisis]] is expected to be followed by an economic and financial crisis, leading to a broader political crisis and a crisis of Russian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. These are described as "the darkest times" of Russian history in the 21st century, possibly comparable in scale to events of a century ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

Historical analogies include:
*   The Crimean War (1853-1856) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>
*   The Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>
*   The First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>

The outcome of the Crimean War, while shameful, stimulated important positive changes for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. The current events are also compared to the events of 1990-1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

Foreign companies have ceased providing warranty service for many manufacturing enterprises in Russia, particularly for compressors. This has led to repairs being carried out by engineers internally, increasing the probability of technical accidents in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>. This situation highlights the [[Impact of sanctions on Russia | impact of sanctions on Russia]] on Russian industry.

## Prospects for Sanctions Removal

The speaker's team anticipates that under their governance, sanctions against Russia could be lifted relatively quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. This expectation is not an "empty calculation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. It is based on regular consultations held with Western countries at a high level, specifically at the decision-making level regarding the lifting of sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. These [[Perspectives on Western Response and Sanctions | perspectives on Western response and sanctions]] suggest a pathway for future normalization.

### Mitigation Strategies

Currently, the so-called import substitution in Russia is primarily the replacement of Western products and machinery with Chinese alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. This strategy either removes or at least mitigates the problem of technical degradation caused by the [[Impact of economic sanctions on Russia | economic impacts of sanctions on Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.

## Kremlin's Strategic Posture and Internal Measures

The Kremlin's current stance is marked by "more fear" and a focus on how [[putins_plans_for_military_victory_and_notions_of_victory | Putin expects to achieve victory over Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This includes the resumption of mobilization and the introduction of martial law elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Reasons for Canceled Public Events

The President of the Russian Federation refused all traditional large-scale public events at the end of the year, including a New Year's reception and a large press conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. His message to the Federal Assembly also remained in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Three reasons are cited for this:
*   **Lack of answers** He has nothing to say in response to potential pressing questions, and any truthful question is currently unwanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Health concerns** The President's health is a factor, as he is unable to withstand hours of intense stress from public appearances like press conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Doctors do not recommend exposing him to such risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Security caution** There is a general caution, with alleged concerns that Ukrainian aircraft might be capable of penetrating deep into Russian territory, and the Russian air defense system might not be able to identify or detain them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The risk of unidentified aircraft appearing over the Kremlin during a public address is seen as too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. For security reasons, the President intends to celebrate New Year deep underground, far from Moscow and beyond the Urals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Putin's Military Strategy Elements for Ukraine

A certain system of [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Putin's military strategy]] with respect to Ukraine has been decided upon, consisting of several key elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>:

*   **Strategic Defensive** Since September, Russia has adopted a [[russian_military_tactics_in_ukraine | strategic defensive]] posture, forming the "Surovikin line" to exhaust the offensive impulse of the [[ukraines_military_strategy_and_international_support | Ukrainian armed forces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. There is no doubt among the Russian military that Ukraine is preparing a large-scale offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Energy Infrastructure Destruction** The destruction of Ukrainian energy infrastructure serves two simultaneous goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>:
    *   To demoralize Ukrainian society, disorganize its economy (especially the military sector), and pressure the Ukrainian government to agree to a [[kremlins_perception_of_peace_with_ukraine | deal with the Kremlin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
    *   To provoke immigration from Ukraine to Europe, causing discontent among Western governments and societies, which would then pressure Zelensky to agree to a [[kremlins_perception_of_peace_with_ukraine | Peace Agreement with Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This strategy is reportedly already partially working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Russian Counter-Offensive** The idea of a [[russian_military_tactics_in_ukraine | Russian counter-offensive]] is a key element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Potential targets include Kyiv or cutting off Ukraine's supply routes for new weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This offensive could be launched from Belarus, which is a reason for Putin's visit to Lukashenko on December 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. However, it is unlikely to yield practical results as Putin has been unable to force Lukashenko's hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Transformation into a Military Camp** A basic element of the strategy is the transformation of Russia into a military camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

## Western Calls for Peace and Their Motivations

The West has made calls for peace, with the US Secretary of State stating that the warring parties should return to the situation on the morning of February 24, implying Russia's refusal of new territories but not of Crimea or the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Boris Johnson echoed this sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Henry Kissinger also published an article proposing a solution to the [[potential_changes_in_russias_foreign_policy_towards_ukraine | Russian-Ukrainian confrontation]], advocating for a return to the pre-military action status quo and then discussions on the status of Crimea and Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Kissinger's goal is to keep Russia in Europe and inflict a military defeat without causing revanchism in the Russian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Reasons for these peace proposals include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>:
*   **Uncertainty of Military Actions** The "fog of war" means victory is not guaranteed, and the outcome is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Risk of Nuclear Escalation** The risk of [[putins_strategic_options_in_response_to_western_pressure | nuclear escalation]] is unfortunately not zero and is taken very seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Human and Economic Pressure on Europe** Russia's energy war is increasing human and demographic pressure on Europe, which Europeans dislike. They also resent suffering economic and financial losses from the protracted confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **Fear of Russian Destabilization** There is concern that a [[putins_strategic_options_in_response_to_western_pressure | crushing military defeat of the Russian Federation]] (which is not excluded) could lead to serious political consequences with unpredictable destabilization, posing a danger to Europe and the global order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Therefore, some Western forces do not wish to take things to extremes, believing the risks outweigh the benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## Internal Mobilization and Economic Hardship

Signs of a second stage of mobilization and the imposition of martial law are becoming apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Second Stage of Mobilization** While some information suggested it would begin after winter holidays, it is projected to start in the last ten days of December in a "gentle form," like document verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. There is evidence of invitations to military enlistment offices for document verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. A Moscow region military commissar's statement about increasing military service terms from spring 2023 (1.5 to 2 years) was widely spread, despite official denial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This indicates instructions were given to prepare for an increase in service length and a second mobilization stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. This stage is expected to be more massive than the first "partial" mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.
*   **Martial Law** The second stage of mobilization is highly probable to be associated with the extension of martial law to all or a significant part of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. This includes restrictions on travel abroad and even movement between regions within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Orders prohibiting employees and their families from Rostec and Rosneft from leaving Russia, and recommending top Rosneft management not to leave Moscow, are seen as tests or actual introductions of martial law elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. This reflects a "secondary vision of serfdom" where state service binds individuals to their workplace, preventing them from quitting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Economic Measures** A mobilization economy with attachment to the workplace is a logical next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. This also implies a redistribution of assets from "wrong" oligarchs (those criticizing the state or unwilling to give up assets for victory) to the state or "patriotic" oligarchs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. While nationalization of small and medium-sized businesses is not officially planned, regional security agencies might take control of income-generating businesses under various pretexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
*   **Ideological Pumping** The concept of a "people's war," proposed by a presidential administration head, may become the core of propaganda work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. However, recent sociology indicates that this propaganda is not working effectively, or even negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. TV viewers have largely stopped watching propaganda talk shows, switching to entertainment content, as people are tired of the official hysteria and want to forget about the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>.
*   **Poverty and Spending Habits** There is a perception that Putin is fighting the poor, as many mobilize and do not return, seemingly reducing the number of poor people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. However, Russians' income is decreasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. Sociology shows 70% of citizens reduced expenses in Q3, saving on clothes, eating out, or household items, and increasingly refusing vacations and new electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. People plan to buy fewer and cheaper gifts for the New Year, indicating less money available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. Even those with money are saving it in anticipation of worse times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.
*   **Suppression of Protests** Authorities have given preliminary orders to security forces to "mercilessly suppress" women's protests, should they arise, echoing the phrase "Do not fire blanks. Do not spare the bullets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. This indicates an expectation of resistance to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The current legal and penal system in Russia is described as "absolutely monstrous," a "Living hell social hell on earth" where conditions are extremely harsh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

## Current Projects and Issues

### Super Prisons Construction
Plans were initiated to modernize the execution of punishments by building "huge in area super prisons" in 29 regions across Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. These projects are budget-financed, meaning they are paid for by taxes and deductions from energy resource sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The project's genesis stems from a period when the number of prisoners in the Russian Federation was stable or growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

However, the military-political situation has since changed, altering the need for such extensive financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. There is an existing idea among some Chekists to use these facilities as "Stalin-era camps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The construction is also seen as similar to the embezzlement of budget money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### Treatment of Political Prisoners
After the death of Navalny, there has been an increase in solitary confinement for political prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>. A planned series of similar special operations against [[judicial_reform_and_political_prisoners_in_russia | political prisoners]] has been mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>. The speaker notes that anyone can be killed in a Russian prison, including figures like Ilya Yashin, though he is not currently among the primary targets, which are prominent figures of Russian political emigration abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:12">[00:41:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.

## Proposed [[reforms_and_rehabilitation_in_russian_governance | Reforms]] Under a New Government

The speaker's team aims for radical change, not just seizing power, but fundamentally altering the foundations of society and the state in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Judicial and Penal System
*   **Release of Political Prisoners**: It is expected that [[judicial_reform_and_political_prisoners_in_russia | political prisoners]], such as Furgal, will be released after a change of regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Abolition of Torture**: Torture is considered unacceptable in any context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.
*   **Lustration**: The possibility of lustration (purging officials from public office) for those involved in election fraud, such as school directors, head teachers, and teachers, is mentioned. Those who "persist in their delusions" will be punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.
*   **Fate of Current Officials**: Individuals like Medvedev would face "first treatment for alcoholism and then the fate... according to the law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>.

### Social and Economic [[reforms_and_future_strategies_for_russias_governance_and_social_systems | Reforms]]
*   **Animal Protection**: The current attitude towards animals, particularly the "monstrous situation" with stray animals and "euthanasia" laws, is condemned. The animal protection system will be radically changed towards greater humaneness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>. Animal rights activists are encouraged to influence the situation by contacting media and bloggers to cancel regional laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.
*   **Pension [[reforms_and_rehabilitation_in_russian_governance | Reforms]]**: A "real broad comprehensive pension reform" is planned, which will consider and resolve the issue of compensation for pensions taken from those who left Russia before the collapse of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.
*   **Social Payments**: Plans exist to significantly raise all social payments, with sufficient financial and economic opportunities to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>.
*   **Mandatory Goods Labeling**: The system of mandatory goods labeling, created under the pretext of quality control but serving to enrich specific individuals, will not be maintained or used to benefit those people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:15">[00:28:15]</a>.
*   **Combating Smoking**: A comprehensive program to combat smoking (the addiction itself, not smokers) is proposed, with an ambitious goal to largely eliminate smoking or at least ensure young people do not smoke by 2040-2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.
*   **Housing Prices**: The team has a plan to decrease real estate prices, though details are handled by professionals and not publicly revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:15">[00:26:15]</a>. This will occur after a short-term period of chaos following a change of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.
*   **Addressing "Info Gypsies"**: The current state's fight against online fraudsters (info gypsies) is primarily about collecting taxes, not protecting people from being fooled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:28">[00:33:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.

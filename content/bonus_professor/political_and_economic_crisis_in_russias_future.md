The current military confrontation is escalating into a [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | military crisis]] that will inevitably develop into a large-scale and acute [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>. This will lead to a colossal crisis and potentially the collapse of Russian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>.

## Escalation of Military Action

The Kremlin's rejection of a peace proposal was evidenced by a massive missile strike on Ukrainian infrastructure on November 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This indicates an escalation of military action to a new, more dangerous phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. President Putin has reportedly decided to adopt a strategy of "spearhead counter-escalation," understanding that this will lead to a buildup of military power and strikes on Russian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### Consequences of Escalation

*   **Ukrainian Response:**
    *   Ukraine is expected to receive new long-range weapons, ammunition, and missiles, including drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
    *   The zone of destruction for Ukrainian armed forces will expand beyond border regions to include Central Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.
    *   Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev was sent to inspect Central Russia's air defense system for readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.
    *   An oil depot in the Varlovskaya region was undermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
    *   Ukrainian troops have allegedly gone on the offensive in Popasnaya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

*   **Russian Actions:**
    *   Russia will continue massive shelling if it has enough missiles or receives them from its strategic ally in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
    *   A major offensive by Russian armed forces in Ukraine is unlikely, as Russia has adopted a concept of strategic defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
    *   A second stage of mobilization is scheduled for after the New Year, though it might be accelerated if the Ukrainian offensive proves successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. This will likely be termed an "additional mobilization" or "completion of partial mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.
    *   The involvement of NATO countries (excluding the United States) in the conflict is not ruled out, potentially leading to symmetrical strikes, such as cyber attacks, on these countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.
    *   The conflict zone could expand, including strikes on logistics hubs through sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

## Domestic [[Political and economic climate in Russia | Political and Economic Climate]]

Escalation is expected to further restrict civil liberties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

### Potential Measures and Restrictions

*   **Martial Law:** Martial law may be introduced in large Russian cities after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. This could extend from territories formally considered part of Russia (e.g., "new territories of Ukraine") to regions bordering Ukraine, and eventually to Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other major cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.
    *   Under martial law, military-civilian administrations or military commandants could receive special rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
    *   A curfew may be introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.
    *   These new authorities could detain citizens without trial for up to 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
    *   They could also confiscate property, such as all-terrain vehicles or equipment, from citizens and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Mobilization:** The economy will undergo further non-stateization and mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. Up to 40% of the economy is already connected with the "special military operation," and this share is expected to increase due to insufficient Russian resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

### Declining Popularity and State Instability

Closed polls indicate that Putin's popularity is rapidly declining, and protest moods are growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. The authorities' response is to "tighten the screws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. This tightening could exacerbate the existing instability of Russian statehood, which is described as "falling apart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. The behavior of figures like Kadyrov is cited as an example of disloyalty and actions outside the Russian legal field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>.

## Looming Crises

The military crisis will inevitably evolve into a [[political_crisis_and_economic_implications_in_russia | political crisis]], leading to a colossal crisis and potential collapse of Russian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>. This does not mean Russia will disappear, but it signifies a fundamental change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>.

### The "Last Argument"

Putin's personal strategy is to escalate the conflict, believing it is the only way to force the West to retreat and pressure Ukraine into a peace agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. The West, however, does not intend to retreat and will increase pressure on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. Russia's combined power is deemed unable to withstand the pressure of the consolidated West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.

The possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons, while currently on hold, is not ruled out as a "last argument" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>.

### Interconnected Crises

The military crisis is accompanied by a developing [[economic_and_political_challenges_in_russia | economic crisis]] and a financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>. These are intertwined with the [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | political crisis]] and a crisis of Russian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>.

## Historical Analogies

The speaker believes that Russia is entering the darkest period of its history in the 21st century, possibly comparable to events a century ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. The closest historical analogies are:

*   The Crimean War (1853-1856) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>.
*   The Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.
*   The First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>.

While the exit from the Crimean War was "shameful," it stimulated important positive changes for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>. The speaker anticipates consequences and scale comparable to the events of 1990-1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>.

The YouTube channel of Valery Soloviev, a doctor of historical sciences, political analyst, and public figure, serves as a platform for his programs [00:00:05].

## Information Landscape

YouTube is a highly popular video hosting site in Russia [00:02:53]. While many, if not most, visitors to YouTube are not interested in politics and do not use the platform to seek information about political events, they primarily go there for entertainment or for useful, practical content [00:02:55]. This non-politicized audience, for whom the motto "outside of politics" is a guiding principle, is a key factor in why Russian authorities might be delaying its complete blockage [00:03:46]. However, the authorities may still fear the possible politicization of this audience if the platform were to be shut down [00:04:01].

The current situation in Russia is compared to the Soviet era, where alternative media was scarce, suggesting a shrinking space for diverse information sources [00:01:38]. Many alternative media outlets have ceased to exist, unable to speak freely, with some, like Silver Rain, stopping news production [00:01:51]. This narrowing of the information field is similar to the Soviet Union, which had limited television channels and newspapers [00:02:18].

## Economic Impact on Content Creators

A significant number of people in Russia earn money on YouTube, with some making decent incomes and others smaller amounts, but it remains a source of income for many [00:03:16]. This income source is particularly important given the context of declining incomes in Russia [00:03:23].

However, YouTube has ceased monetization and stopped showing ads in the Russian Federation, which has sharply reduced income for creators [00:03:32]. The speaker himself notes that earning money through advertising on YouTube is now impossible [02:00:57]. This makes direct financial support from viewers crucial for creators to continue their work, with a portion of such support also going to public and charitable needs [02:08:08].

## Threat of Closure and [[impact_of_new_laws_in_russia | New Laws]]

YouTube is under threat of closure in Russia [00:02:46]. This threat comes amidst a broader crackdown on information, exemplified by new laws that make it unclear how to discuss events in Ukraine, as "any phrase can be regarded as empty" and "any information can potentially be regarded" as false [00:04:20]. The term "anti-war movement" itself appears to be prohibited [00:04:48].

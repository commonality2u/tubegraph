This article addresses several questions regarding Russia's current and future economic state, including financial challenges, social welfare, and strategies for dealing with potential crises.

## Current Economic Stability and Challenges

While Russia currently has financial income from hydrocarbon sales, the regime's own supporters believe it has outlived its usefulness, signaling a need for new approaches [00:12:27]. The speaker notes that a crisis often begins with conflict within the elites, which is currently very serious and unstoppable [00:13:02].

### Sanctions and Economic Outlook
If a broad compromise with Ukraine is not reached, a significant portion of sanctions will remain in place [00:29:04]. While it's possible to exist under sanctions, the situation is worsening, and the risk of chaos is very high and increasing [00:28:51]. An [[economic_crisis_and_financial_implications_in_russia | economic crisis]] is considered inevitable, likely to cover the end of this year and the beginning of next, further deepening the [[political_crisis_and_economic_implications_in_russia | political crisis]] [00:38:17].

### Currency and Deposits
There are currently no plans to ban the export of cash dollars and euros [00:09:42]. Existing restrictions limit personal export to $10,000 per person, though implementation is difficult [00:10:05]. The economic sector of the government opposes further restrictions [00:10:17].

While there are no financial reasons for freezing deposits, such an option was previously considered as a way to reduce money circulation and ensure deflation, as reportedly demanded by Patrushev [00:25:37]. However, influential figures in the Russian elite have spoken out against this "destructive" idea, and it is not currently being considered [00:26:16].

For personal savings, it is recommended to exchange a portion of deposits into foreign currency, ideally dollars, within a week as the exchange rate is stabilizing and going down [00:37:30]. This is advised because the dollar exchange rate is expected to grow in the medium to long term due to the impending crisis [00:38:13].

## Social Welfare and Public Services

### Pensions
Current "beggarly" and "understated" pensions will be significantly increased, as Russia's budget has the financial capacity for this [00:20:54]. However, the idea of uniform pensions for all professions, regardless of labor contribution or qualification, is deemed unfair [00:24:17]. The principle of "to each according to his labor" is supported [00:24:25].

### Housing and Communal Services
The sector for housing and communal services, including issues of high tariffs and low-quality construction, will undergo thorough and radical reform [00:22:07]. The key focus will be on ensuring complete transparency in financial resource allocation [00:22:16]. The speaker states that the efficiency of these services can only be described in negative categories [00:22:25].

### Access to Medicine
There is no guarantee that purchases of specialized, non-mass-produced European Union drugs will continue [00:10:39]. Interruptions are possible, and the shortage of vital drugs is already acute and expected to worsen [00:11:00]. Individuals dependent on these medicines are advised to create reserves or find alternative channels for acquisition [00:10:49]. This highlights challenges related to [[impact_of_food_crises_and_preparedness_strategies | crisis preparedness]].

## Crisis Management and Future Reforms

### Overcoming the Crisis
If the speaker's team comes to power, noticeable improvements could be seen almost immediately, but a full recovery from the crisis and a return to sustainable, rapid development could take up to a year and a half to two years [00:39:01].

### Policy Reforms
Future reforms will be sweeping, affecting nearly all sectors in Russia, including the film industry [00:40:10]. Key areas of focus include:
*   **Internet Freedom**: Laws concerning the blocking of various internet resources will be repealed almost automatically [00:26:31].
*   **Electoral System**: To ensure real party competition, a return to the old election law (pre-2003 amendments) is necessary for forming full-fledged political parties [00:26:56].
*   **Justice System**: Special departments or commissions will be created, possibly within the Ministry of Internal Affairs, to restore constitutional legality, including civil and political rehabilitation, and addressing property issues for those who fled Russia [00:34:30].
*   **National Documents**: While not a priority, documents like passports will change with the establishment of a new Russian republic and gradual changes to legislative acts [00:19:52].

### Migration Policy
The speaker dismisses concerns about widespread Islamization in Russia, believing it can be prevented with a skillful and comprehensive migration policy, particularly with the introduction of a visa regime [00:16:32]. The policy of replacing the population with immigrants was previously encouraged by the late President Putin, who saw new citizens as more reliable in voting and more dependent [00:09:12]. Patrushev and Chemezov are generally not supporters of this population replacement [00:09:05].

## Social and Political Dynamics

### Public Perception and Propaganda
It is acknowledged that a "zombified" part of the Russian population is deeply imbued with propaganda and hatred for Ukraine [00:02:41]. To overcome this, the state propaganda machine must be switched off [00:03:16]. A significant portion of society (up to six months) would then "come to its senses," though a minority may persist in their delusions [00:03:23]. The goal is to change the country's climate from "malignant to benign" through new narratives [00:03:41].

Many people are tired and rely on ready-made formulas provided by propaganda, a "normal process of saving energy" [00:32:32]. Even significant events or "grandiose things" (like recent Ministry of Defense purges) may not sway those unwilling to see or understand, described as a common cognitive error where people cannot imagine a future different from the present [00:33:03].

### Putin's Status and Successors
The speaker maintains that Putin has been dead since at least October 26 of last year and is replaced by a double [00:01:42]. The recent appointments of Putin's alleged relatives to government positions are viewed as a "smokescreen" to prove he is alive, despite the real Putin never doing such things [00:41:56]. The election was won by a double, making it "initially illegal," and even then, the double did not secure over 50% of the votes according to Hamburg, with official numbers being "lies and falsification" [00:02:08]. Ukraine's intelligence chief, Budanov, also spoke of Putin's doubles [00:14:50].

Despite Putin's death, military actions continue because the current leadership is interested in prolonging and strengthening their power on favorable terms for peace [00:15:27].

Patrushev and Chemezov are identified as influential figures, with Patrushev retaining his influence, though the Chemezov group is now no less influential, especially in socio-economic policy implementation [00:31:08].

### Potential Mobilization
The issue of freezing credit cards and deposits was considered for those who receive a summons, as a measure to encourage mobilization [00:25:02]. However, the speaker believes there is a greater chance that full mobilization will not occur, and any decision would be political, no earlier than late summer or early autumn [00:25:18]. For those concerned about mobilization, the advice is not to live at the place of registration [00:36:36].

### Georgia Operation 2008
Regarding the 2008 operation in Georgia, the speaker states that President Saakashvili was "lured into a trap" successfully [00:24:43].

### Russia's Territorial Integrity
In a crisis, the North Caucasus regions are expected to have higher risks for movements seeking secession from Russia [00:27:52]. While not stating they would necessarily separate, it is noted that Chechnya, if independent, has a promised financial protector [00:28:11]. The speaker did not claim that Tatarstan and Bashkortostan could not secede [00:27:34].

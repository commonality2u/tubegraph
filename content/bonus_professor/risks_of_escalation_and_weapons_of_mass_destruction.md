As of April 18, 2022, the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine has become the central focus of Russian politics, leading to an approaching culmination of the confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Reasons for Approaching Culmination

From the Russian perspective, the Kremlin has not achieved its initial combat or political goals in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The undisclosed circumstances surrounding the death of the cruiser Varyag and the lack of public mourning or casualty figures have raised questions about the effectiveness of Russia's "limited special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The Russian leadership urgently needs a strategic turning point on the front lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

On the Ukrainian side, there is a strong resolve, with President Zelensky and the Ukrainian leadership refusing to meet Russia's ultimatum demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This stance is supported by the West, which publicly states that the fate of peace talks will be decided on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Ukraine believes it is capable of inflicting significant damage on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Symptoms of Escalation

Russian troops are concentrating in Donbass with the aim of creating a "cauldron" for Ukrainian armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Simultaneously, the West is rapidly supplying complex and strike weapons to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. The upcoming "Battle of Donbass" is considered a key event by all parties involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. However, senior Russian military sources indicate a lack of confidence in victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

The confrontation is expected to be extremely fierce, marked by mutual bitterness due to recent events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## High Risk of Escalation

The risk of [[escalation_of_military_action_between_russia_and_ukraine | escalation]] is very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. If the Kremlin fails to achieve its military and political goals, particularly forcing Ukraine to sign a peace treaty on its terms, the risks of using [[the_implications_of_nuclear_weapons_policy | weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Potential Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction

There is an increased risk of using [[potential_use_of_nuclear_weapons | low-yield nuclear weapons]], specifically low-yield tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. The possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons is constantly discussed in relation to the situation in Donbass and Ukraine, confirmed by various Western sources, including the American military and intelligence (e.g., the head of the CIA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

WMD also includes chemical and bacteriological weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Representatives of the Russian Ministry of Defense and the self-proclaimed republics constantly hint that Ukraine may commit provocations against civilians or possess chemical weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. These "not at all subtle" hints suggest a potential escalation mechanism for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

Given Ukraine's effective resistance, largely due to Western advanced weapon supplies, there is a temptation for Russia to interrupt these logistical chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. There is discussion about how to achieve this, possibly with tactical nuclear weapons, though no decision has been made on whether such a strike would be on Ukrainian territory or a neighboring country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Other Escalation Triggers

Other mechanisms that could trigger [[escalation_of_military_action_between_russia_and_ukraine | escalation]] include:
*   Ukrainian strikes on military and civilian targets in Russian regions adjacent to Ukraine, especially as Ukraine is expected to receive missiles capable of reaching Russian military airfields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   Potential terrorist attacks in Moscow and other large Russian cities, hinted at in official and state-associated Russian media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Parallels to the Cuban Missile Crisis

The world is currently in a situation very close to, and perhaps even more acute than, the Cuban Missile Crisis that occurred 60 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. The speaker urges prayers for the avoidance of "the most terrible path" that could trigger self-destruction on a significant, perhaps global, scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Possible Future Scenarios (If Nuclear Escalation is Avoided)

Assuming the most dangerous option is avoided, there are three [[possible_future_scenarios_of_crisis_resolution | possibilities for further developments]]:
1.  **Peace Treaty**: This option seems unlikely given the current positions of both sides, particularly Russia's "unrealizable" demands on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
2.  **Truce**: A cessation of hostilities, either partial or full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
3.  **Continuation of Positional Battles**: A truce might be accompanied by, or give way to, ongoing sluggish military actions after the expected military culmination in April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This state could last until at least the fall of this year, or possibly longer, according to American sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## Internal Russian Dynamics Fueling Risk

The failure of the "limited military operation" has led to a blame game within Russia, with subordinates, rather than the leadership, being held responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Individuals blamed for providing misleading information or instilling false confidence include:
*   Minister of Defense Shuryga, who has fallen into disgrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   The former head of the 5th Service of the FSB, responsible for operational information on Ukraine and behind-the-scenes preparations for Russian troops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This individual is reportedly in pre-trial detention and subjected to physical abuse, with other officers giving confessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
*   Problems also exist within the Main Directorate of the General Staff (military intelligence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

While there is no grand conspiracy or elite split, tension and disorganization are increasing within the security forces and top bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This is expected to intensify after the special military operation concludes, as a purge will be carried out to name and punish culprits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

Additionally, strengthening Western sanctions will continue to be sensitive and difficult for the Russian economy, leading to technological degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. Discussions among the security environment about nationalizing large private assets are also causing nervousness among big business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

## Outlook

There are barely noticeable signs of "hatization" (deterioration) within the security forces, characterized by confusion and fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. The highest elites are reportedly confused about how to exit the situation, knowing it will worsen, and anticipate a "very sad outcome" for themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This process is compared to the Russian Empire before World War I, where "three years" led to "dukhatization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. While the Russian government is trying to "tighten the screws" to prevent this, the underlying structure is seen as "rusty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

The "Putin era" is coming to an end, and it is likely that this end will not be triumphant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

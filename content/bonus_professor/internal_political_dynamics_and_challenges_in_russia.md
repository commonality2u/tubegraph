Valery Solovya, on May 22, 2022, summarized the military and political results of the preceding week, offering insights into [[Russian internal political dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12"></a>.

## Military Situation and Strategic Shifts
While the surrender of Azovstal fighters was a military and symbolic success for Russia, it did not constitute a strategic turning point in the conflict with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31"></a>. Ukrainian troops conducted a successful counteroffensive near Kharkiv, and fierce battles on the Seversky Donets were not crowned with Russian success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04"></a>.

Russia appears to be less focused on achieving a strategic turning point and more on consolidating the existing territorial status quo, aiming to legalize it through negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21"></a>. This includes the recognition of Crimea as Russian, Donbas as independent, and Russia's retention of parts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions to secure a land bridge to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47"></a>.

## Revival of Russian Influence in Europe
A symptom of Russia's new strategy is the revival of its agents of influence in European Union countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58"></a>. Examples include:
*   Former Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi, a "great personal friend" of Putin, publicly stated that Europe must convince Ukraine to accept Russia's conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14"></a>.
*   The Italian Foreign Ministry simultaneously sent peace proposals to Ukraine that could be profitable for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04"></a>.
*   French and German politicians have also implicitly or explicitly offered to make peace with Ukraine immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33"></a>.

These European leaders' push for peace is attributed to several factors:
*   **Russian Leverage**: Russia possesses leverage and influence over certain European politicians, possibly through friendly ties (like with Berlusconi) or compromising information on current leaders such as Macron and Scholz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00"></a>.
*   **Fear of Escalation**: European leaders fear conflict escalation, including the potential use of non-conventional weapons and an increase in refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25"></a>. The six million refugees already outside Ukraine represent a significant financial and social burden on the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49"></a>.
*   **Global Famine Threat**: The conflict limits Ukraine's ability to export grain, contributing to a growing threat of global famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06"></a>. Russian propaganda and officials actively exploit this threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36"></a>.

## Ukraine's Position and International Support
Ukraine, led by President Zelensky, insists that the outcome will be decided on the battlefield, with peace negotiations only beginning once a military advantage is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01"></a>. Ukraine's stance is supported by the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as Poland, the Baltic countries, and some other European nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16"></a>.

The United States has reportedly pressured German Chancellor Scholz and French President Macron, indicating that it possesses compromising information on them, similar to Russia, and urged them to adhere to Euro-Atlantic solidarity and NATO's course of unconditional support for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44"></a>. This support is interpreted as waging war to a victorious end for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15"></a>.

## [[Russian sociopolitical dynamics]] and [[Russian internal political dynamics]]
The speaker notes that Russia, though not publicly, consistently tries to transition to peace negotiations on its own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25"></a>. Meanwhile, Ukraine is counting on a strategic turning point, aiming for technological and military superiority, with a potential counteroffensive by late summer or early autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41"></a>. Ukraine's long-term goals range from restoring the territorial status quo of February 24, 2022, to potentially including Donbas and Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22"></a>.

This Ukrainian intention causes tension on the Russian side, as evidenced by statements from Russian propaganda regarding the catastrophic implications of Ukraine crossing the Russian border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44"></a>. This suggests a fear that Russia's territorial gains, including Donbas, could be reversed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12"></a>. A "realistically thinking part of the Russian military," disconnected from the General Staff, implicitly acknowledges the possibility of losing these new territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31"></a>. The immediate construction of defensive fortifications in newly acquired territories indicates Russia's preparation for defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48"></a>.

Regarding the stability of these new territories, the speaker expresses skepticism about their permanence, likening current declarations of "forever with Russia" to similar claims in Soviet times that eventually dissolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16"></a>. The vice-premier responsible for construction in the Russian government, Khusnullin, benefits financially from rebuilding efforts in areas like Mariupol and Donbas, suggesting a cycle where money is allocated for reconstruction only to be lost if the territory's status changes again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27"></a>.

### Failures and Discontent within the Elite
A significant challenge within [[Russian political dynamics and leadership issues]] is the failure of the import substitution program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06"></a>. Despite 14 years and colossal budget allocations, Senator Klishas, a representative of the KGB lobby and not an opposition figure, openly stated the program has failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26"></a>. This statement is seen not merely as an attack on Manturov and Chemezov (responsible for the program) but as an expression of discontent from the entire KGB lobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07"></a>. They reported to the president that the program was going wrong, being implemented under the guise of "Chineseization" or localization, and serving personal and group interests rather than national ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11"></a>.

This dissatisfaction, particularly regarding President Putin's continued trust in those responsible for the program's failure, indicates that the system, which revolves around Putin as its "core," is beginning to vibrate and disintegrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47"></a>. The speaker points to health problems affecting Putin, as mentioned by Oliver Stone and discussed in a May 20 broadcast, further contributing to the system's turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32"></a>.

Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, in its 44th program, discusses [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin's]] expectations for achieving victory over Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This involves a multi-faceted approach, constituting elements of [[Russian foreign policy and military strategy | Putin's military strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Elements of the Strategy

### Strategic Defensive
Since September, Russia has shifted to a strategic defensive posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The "Surovikin line" is currently being formed, with the goal of exhausting the offensive impulse of the [[Ukraines strategic military goals | Ukrainian armed forces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. It is widely accepted, even by the Russian military, that Ukraine is preparing for a large-scale offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Destruction of Energy Infrastructure
A key element of [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin's]] strategy is the destruction of Ukraine's energy infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This pursues two main goals:
1.  **Demoralization and Disorganization** To demoralize Ukrainian society and, if possible, disorganize the Ukrainian economy, particularly the military sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This is intended to pressure Ukrainian society to compel its government to agree to a deal with the [[Kremlins view on peace with Ukraine | Kremlin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
2.  **Provoking Migration** To provoke an influx of Ukrainian immigrants into Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The aim is for this migration to cause discontent among Western governments and societies, leading them to pressure President Zelensky to pursue a peace agreement with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Reportedly, this strategy is already showing some effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Russian Counter-Offensive
Another element of [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin's strategy]] is the idea of a Russian counter-offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The target of this counter-offensive is not entirely clear, with two main versions being considered:
*   An attempt to take Kyiv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   Cutting off Ukraine's supply routes for new weapons, which are crucial for the success of [[Ukraines strategic military goals | Ukrainian offensive operations]] against Russian positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

This offensive could be launched from Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin]] intends to visit Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on December 19, partially for this reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. However, it is suggested that this trip might not yield significant practical results due to Lukashenko's resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### Transformation of Russia into a Military Camp
The final, and perhaps basic, element of [[Russian foreign policy and military strategy | Russia's military strategy]] concerning Ukraine is the transformation of the Russian Federation into a military camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This includes:
*   **Resumption of Mobilization:** There are clear signs that a second stage of mobilization is underway, starting with document verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>. Offers for military registration and enlistment office appearances for "document verification" are being widely reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. A military commissar from the Moscow region, Lieutenant Colonel Fotin, stated that military service terms would increase from one to one and a half years, and eventually to two years, starting in spring 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Although [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin]] attempted to dismiss this as an old statement, it is understood that military commissars have received instructions to prepare for such developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. The second stage of mobilization is expected to be more massive than the first "partial mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.
*   **Introduction of Martial Law Elements:** Obvious signs of martial law elements are emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, including restrictions on travel abroad and movement within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. For example, employees of Rostec and Rosneft, along with their families, have been prohibited from leaving the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Top management of Rosneft is recommended not to leave Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. This mirrors historical instances of secondary serfdom where all societal strata are attached to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Mobilization Economy and Asset Redistribution:** The introduction of martial law would logically lead to a mobilization economy, with attachment to the workplace, meaning individuals cannot quit or move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. There will also be a redistribution of assets from "wrong" oligarchs (those criticizing the state or not wanting to give up capital) to the state or "right" patriotic oligarchs who suffered losses from sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. Small and medium-sized businesses could also face nationalization or forced transfer to state control under various pretexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.
*   **Ideological Pumping:** The concept of a "people's war," proposed by a presidential administration head, may become central to agitation and propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. However, recent sociology indicates that TV viewers are shunning propaganda talk shows in favor of entertainment content, suggesting a fatigue with official hysteria and a desire to forget the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. Mediascope's study shows a significant drop in popularity for propaganda programs compared to earlier months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.
*   **Poverty and Economic Hardship:** [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin's]] efforts to fight poverty are instead seen as fighting the poor, as many disappear through mobilization or face decreased incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. Sociology reveals that 70% of Russian citizens reduced expenses in the third quarter of 2022, cutting back on clothes, dining out, household items, vacations, and electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. People plan to buy fewer and cheaper gifts for the New Year, indicating less money available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. Even those with money are saving it in anticipation of worsening conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

## Western Calls for Peace and their Reasons

Calls for peace have emerged from the West, with figures like the US Secretary of State and former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggesting a return to the situation on the morning of February 24, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This would imply Russia's refusal of new territories, but not a refusal of Crimea or the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Henry Kissinger's article in a British publication also proposed returning to the status quo preceding [[Military aid and strategy in the Ukrainian conflict | military actions]], followed by discussions on the status of Crimea and possibly Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

The goal behind these proposals is to prevent a military defeat for Russia without causing a feeling of revanchism in the Russian leadership or society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The reasons for these Western proposals are rooted in historical experience and current concerns:
*   **Uncertainty of Military Actions:** There is a "fog of war," meaning victory is not guaranteed for either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Risk of Nuclear Escalation:** The risk of nuclear escalation is unfortunately not zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Energy War and Demographic Pressure:** Russia's energy war increases human and demographic pressure on Europe, leading to economic and financial losses that Europeans dislike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **Threat of Russian Destabilization:** There is a fear that a crushing military defeat of the Russian Federation, while not excluded, could lead to serious political consequences and destabilization of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Such destabilization poses no less danger to Europe and the global order than a crushing Russian victory over Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

Some forces within the Western establishment prefer not to push things to extremes, believing the risks outweigh the benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

This article summarizes discussions regarding [[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_operations | Russia's military strategy]] and foreign policy, particularly after the reported death of Putin, based on a public Q&A session.

## Political Landscape and Power Dynamics

Following the reported death of Putin, the war continues, and the question of whether a new government would lead to improved conditions for the country is raised, especially if the same "crooks, thieves, and murderers" remain in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The speaker asserts that radical change is needed, not just a seizure of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Ruling Coalitions and Their Influence
Currently, two main coalitions are said to exert strong influence on the internal agenda in Russia: Patrushev's and Chemezov's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The speaker denies that these groups have significant influence on the external agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

*   **Chemezov's Group**
    This group includes high-ranking officers from the FSB (not all FSB officers are guided by Patrushev) and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Chemezov reportedly has excellent relations with the SVR, which is linked to how Western technological achievements are acquired by the [[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_operations | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Patrushev's Group**
    Patrushev, formerly Secretary of the Security Council, utilizes analysts working under the council's auspices. These analysts provide reports describing problems the [[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_operations | Russian Federation]] will face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Patrushev considers these forecasts, and his proposed solutions are sometimes blocked by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. He had pushed for a quick "Transit" of power before January 1, 2024, but other groups opposing his faction were against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. An agreement appears to have been reached, with further developments expected by late summer or early autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The person currently performing the duties of President is expected to resign before the end of 2024, likely in autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **The Speaker's "Third Coalition"**
    The speaker identifies as a representative of a "third coalition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Their goals are described as "noble and worthy," aiming for the development of Russian society, ensuring [[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_operations | Russia's security]] and national interests exclusively through peaceful and civilized means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. They seek to "radically change the situation in the country" and the very foundations of society and the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### The Duma and Future of the System
The Duma is considered a "weak-willed and pathetic appendage of the executive power," effectively a department of the presidential administration with no independent will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. The current system is believed to have exhausted its internal margin of safety and cannot exist much longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>.

## Military and Foreign Policy Objectives of Key Factions

### Patrushev's Stance on the War
Patrushev advocates for a peace agreement that recognizes the current territorial status quo, meaning the front line would become the new border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### Chemezov's Stance on the War
Chemezov's group supports a "very broad and very flexible compromise" regarding the war's outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

### Western Involvement and [[russian_military_strategy_and_challenges | Russia's Military Strategy]]
The West's decision to allow strikes on Russian territory is attributed to Putin's death, which significantly decreased the probability of a Russian nuclear attack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. This change in policy, occurring more than six months after Putin's reported death, was catalyzed by the May 2024 offensive in the Kharkov region. The offensive, described as "unsuccessful," created a threat of the Ukrainian front collapsing. Western actions were aimed at containing and destroying the offensive impulse of [[russian_military_operations_and_international_relations | Russian troops]], disrupting logistics, and providing urgent aid to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>.

### Russia's Dependence on China
[[impact_of_international_relations_on_russias_military_strategy | Russia's economic dependence on China]] is attributed to Putin's "useless and suicidal" foreign policy. Putin, despite envying China's economic growth, reportedly tried to "screw up China," including attempts to punish it via the COVID-19 epidemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Putin was reportedly forced to issue a "repentant apology" to the Chinese leadership, and territories were effectively transferred to China as new territories, allegedly in exchange for China's support for Russia and its agreement not to formally demand compensation for COVID-19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.

## Future Outlook

### End of Hostilities
While there's no current readiness for peace negotiations, peace is expected after "the most decisive rearrangements" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

### Belarus and Baltic States
The safety of travel to Belarus in summer hinges on whether its territory becomes a springboard for military action or a hybrid operation against the Baltic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. The "Suvalki corridor" is mentioned, with its military use being the "final part of the operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.

### Systemic Changes
The speaker's team expects sanctions against Russia to be lifted relatively quickly under their government, due to ongoing consultations with Western countries at high decision-making levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. They also note that "import substitution" primarily involves replacing Western products with Chinese ones, which mitigates technical degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>.
The dynamics of change are developing somewhat faster than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

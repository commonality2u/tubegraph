The current [[social_and_intellectual_dynamics_in_modern_russian_society | societal and intellectual dynamics]] in Russia are characterized by a reality that has been compared to George Orwell's *1984*, where fiction has become a guide to action [00:01:05]. This environment features "Orwellism" or "idiocy," exemplified by various official statements and actions [00:01:14].

## The Illusion of Consensus

Official narratives suggest widespread support for government actions. President Putin reportedly perceives [[analysis_of_sociological_support_for_russian_government_policies | sociological support]] for the military operation in Ukraine as a carte blanche for the toughest actions [00:05:33].

### Critique of Sociological Data
According to surveys, 71% of the population supports the military operation, with 21% against and 8% undecided [00:06:32]. However, the reliability of official sociological agencies is questioned, especially concerning politically sensitive information [00:06:46]. It is stated that one "can't trust a single word" of such data [00:07:06].

Despite the reported majority, 21% opposition represents "every fifth citizen of the Russian Federation" [00:07:23]. The 8% undecided are believed to have decided but are unwilling to express their true opinion due to fear [00:07:32]. [[public_dissatisfaction_and_political_implications_in_russia | People are intimidated]] and provide "socially approved answers," saying what they believe authorities want to hear [00:07:46]. Therefore, the declared majority support is considered misleading [00:07:56].

### The "Spiral of Silence"
The purpose of official sociology, and propaganda in general, is to form what is called the "spiral of silence" [00:08:10]. This concept describes a situation where individuals in a minority, or those who merely express doubts, feel isolated and are reluctant to voice their opinions, believing they oppose an overwhelming majority [00:08:26]. Propaganda aims to create the impression of a certain position being shared by the "overwhelming majority" [00:08:39].

This technique serves several purposes:
*   To instill a feeling of correctness among those who support government policy [00:09:10].
*   To foster a feeling of "predetermination" among opponents, suggesting that "everything has already been decided" [00:09:14].
*   To cause feelings of "hopelessness and deep depression" in those resisting such policies [00:09:34].

## Propaganda Techniques for Consensus Building
Propaganda forms the "spiral of silence" and the "picture of the world needed by propaganda" using specific techniques [00:10:08]:

*   **The Magic of Numbers**: People are more likely to believe statements reinforced by figures or statistics [00:10:23]. For example, the 71% support figure from TSUM aims to convince people that it is the majority and should not be argued with [00:10:32].
*   **Expert Commentary**: State television channels and media outlets feature "a certain kind of experts" (or "quasi-experts") who provide a "friendly chorus of approval from different positions" [00:10:47]. These individuals are often paid to appear on television or use it for self-promotion [00:11:31].
*   **Voices from the Ground / Emotional Appeals**: This includes orchestrated public speeches and letters of support from regional and municipal officials, who were explicitly ordered by the presidential administration to organize such displays [00:12:01]. Additionally, emotionally manipulative content, such as children from a hospice being made to form the letter "Z" for propaganda, is used [00:12:43]. Propaganda also uses emotionally charged phrases like "where have you been eight years?" to evoke compassion for those who suffered and died, and anger towards perceived enemies [00:14:13]. The focus on children is particularly effective in causing strong emotions [00:15:11].

## Emergence of Dissent and its Drivers

Despite the government's claims of widespread support, the current consensus is seen as "very fragile" and "unstable" [00:16:02].

### Fragility of Support
The authorities know that the supposed "general national consensus" is not genuinely nationwide [00:16:02]. It is predicted that this consensus will soon begin to crumble, leading people to "waver and take a critical position" against the authorities [00:16:16].

### Economic Hardship and the Middle Class
The primary drivers of potential [[russian_societal_change_and_public_dissatisfaction | societal change]] and dissent are expected to be "poverty and food shortages," which are "stronger than billions of words propaganda" [00:16:28].

A significant source of revolutionary sentiment in the modern world is the "middle class" [00:17:02]. This class, which was previously doing "relatively well" and had "life strategies" and long-term plans, has seen all its expectations and dreams collapse within a week [00:17:12]. While they may not have fully felt the "bitter consciousness" yet, it is expected to come "much faster than many people think" [00:18:21]. Many members of this group are already leaving Russia [00:17:37].

### Discontent within the Establishment
An "anti-Putin consensus" is rapidly forming among "yesterday's beneficiaries of the regime," i.e., within the establishment [00:18:33]. These individuals, who accumulated vast wealth, are now unable to spend it or travel abroad, effectively becoming "lepers" [00:18:47]. Their goal was to become part of the world community, and now they feel rejected [00:19:06]. While not yet ready to join the opposition or invest in politics, they are "tense" and forming a "silent for now" anti-Putin consensus [00:19:59]. This discontent from above is expected to converge with the despair and anger of the middle class below [00:20:18].

## Information Control and its Purpose
The government's decision to close "all alternative sources of information" and "shut the mouths of all opinion leaders" indicates that it knows the supposed national consensus is fragile [00:15:38]. This is a clear measure of [[discussion_of_repressive_practices_and_internal_politics_in_russia | internal politics]].

## Future Outlook and Call to Action
Bloomberg, considered a reputable business information agency that previously reported on the threat of military conflict between Russia and Ukraine based on American intelligence [00:21:49], stated that President Putin "may lose his power" within the next 12 months [00:21:00]. This is described as an "unprecedented formulation for the Western media" [00:21:12].

Despite the current difficult situation, there is a belief that it "will be worse" before it gets better [00:22:54]. However, there is hope and a chance to change the situation in Russia [00:23:45]. This is emphasized as the "last chance" for the people and for Russia itself [00:24:11]. The audience is urged to help those who support common sense, human dignity, and moral responsibility, and to remember Alexei Navalny [00:24:31]. Ultimately, there is a conviction that "victory will be ours" [00:25:59].

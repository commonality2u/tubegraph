This article provides an overview of [[mobilization and legal grounds | mobilization]] in the context of Russian law, based on Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel episode, "What is Happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The discussion covers its legal aspects and practical implications for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Definition and Legal Framework

[[Mobilization and military efforts | Mobilization]] is defined as the transfer of a country's state structures, economy, and daily life to a war footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Decisions on [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]] can only be made by the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

It is inextricably linked with the introduction of martial law, whether martial law precedes or follows [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]] is not fundamental, as they are inherently connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

Key federal laws governing [[mobilization strategies and preparations | mobilization preparation]] and martial law include:
*   Federal Law 31: "On [[mobilization strategies and preparations | mobilization preparation]] and [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   Federal Constitutional Law: "On Martial Law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>
*   Law: "On Military Duty and Military Service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

New legal acts related to [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]] may also be adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

[[Mobilization in the Russian Federation | Mobilization]] can be either [[Partial mobilization and its implications | partial]], affecting specific territories of the Russian Federation, or full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. It is assumed that even if [[potential mobilization in Russia | mobilization]] begins as [[Partial mobilization and its implications | partial]], it will likely develop into a full national [[mobilization in the Russian Federation | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Grounds for Martial Law and Mobilization

The law on martial law lists reasons for its introduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The most relevant to the current situation are:
*   Bombing of the territory of the Russian Federation by foreign armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   An attack by the armed forces of a foreign state on the armed forces of the Russian Federation, regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Exile by a foreign state of armed gangs, groups, regular forces, and mercenaries to carry out aggression against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

It is suggested that all three points are already observed to some extent, formally providing legal grounds for the introduction of martial law and subsequent [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation has also previously stated the possibility of a provocation from the Ukrainian side involving chemical means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Who is Subject to Mobilization

Citizens in the reserve who do not have a formal deferment are subject to conscription for [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This includes:
*   Men aged 18 to 50 years with a military ID and an army fitness category of 'A' (fully fit) or 'B' (fit with minor restrictions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   Those with category 'C' (limited fit) who do not serve in peacetime due to health problems but receive a military ID after 27 years old, can also be mobilized from 27 to 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   Women with the necessary education and military registration specialty, primarily medical, but not exclusively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

The reserve is categorized into three groups for privates:
*   **First Category:** Men under 35 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Second Category:** Men up to 45 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Third Category:** Men up to 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
Conscription will begin with the first category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

It is suggested that those who publicly support the "special military operation" (e.g., by displaying the 'Z' symbol) should be prioritized for [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]] as a "worthy proof of their views" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Who is Exempt from Mobilization

Not subject to conscription for [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]]:
*   Individuals who have not served and have not received a military ID up to 27 years old, as they are not considered to be in the reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Students of scientific educational institutions studying full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   Those who received a category 'D' at the draft board, meaning generally not fit for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   Certain categories of female military personnel have exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   Individuals with an unexpunged or unexpunged conviction for a serious crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Grounds for Deferment
A deferment can be received by a person liable for military service who is:
*   Reserved for civilian needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   Category 'G': Temporarily not fit for military service due to illness or loss of ability to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   Caring for relatives or disabled people who need supervision (requires medical certificates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   Guardians of minor brothers or sisters if there are no other guardians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Parents with many children (up to 4 children dependent, dependents up to 16 years old) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   Single parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   Pregnant women after 22 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   Senators and State Duma deputies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. However, it is suggested that they should volunteer to serve in the front ranks as a matter of honor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   Certain categories of citizens may be granted a deferment by the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Practical Consequences and Advice

When [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]] is announced, all citizens subject to conscription must appear at assembly points as specified in [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]] orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. These orders can be delivered at home or work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. It is assumed that police patrols or Russian Guard patrols will assist military registration and enlistment office employees in delivering summonses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

Individuals registered for military service are prohibited from leaving their place of residence once [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]] is announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. If they receive an order or summons, they are obliged to appear at military commissariats or other relevant authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Valid Reasons for Not Appearing
According to federal law, valid reasons for not appearing on summons include:
*   Illness or circumstances related to the loss of ability to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   Serious health condition of certain relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   Death of relatives, requiring participation in a funeral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Penalties for Non-Appearance
*   **In peacetime:** Failure to appear on summons for a military registration and enlistment office incurs administrative liability, such as a warning or a fine from 500 to 3000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Evasion of military service falls under Article 328 of the Criminal Code, with penalties including a fine of up to 200,000 rubles or imprisonment for up to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **In wartime:** The speaker is unsure of the penalties for non-appearance in wartime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

The speaker advises that "it is better to lose a little money than a precious life" and "no less precious health," suggesting that financial penalties might be preferable to military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

### Financial and Travel Restrictions
To "stimulate" attendance, decisions have been made to:
*   Block bank accounts and cards of those subject to [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   Close travel abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

Regarding financial implications, it is suggested to transfer money to relatives' accounts or withdraw cash in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. As for travel, it's advised to keep a foreign passport in a safe place for quick access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

### Geographical Impact
[[Mobilization_process_and_exemptions | Mobilization]] will first affect residents of small and medium-sized cities, and only last of all large cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

### Broader Societal Impact
[[Mobilization_process_and_exemptions | Mobilization]] is not just a call for military service; it signifies a transfer of the entire country, including the economy and financial system, to a military footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This could involve confiscation of private cars for transportation of mobilized personnel and significant impact on the banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. According to estimates, blocking bank accounts of those subject to [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]] could lead to a deeper "financial hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

## Conclusion and Call to Action

It is crucial to think about strategies and make decisions now, before [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]] is announced, as it will be too late once it begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

> "Please think now, decide with your family or yourself, and make a decision for yourself, develop some kind of algorithm of actions." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>

The speaker emphasizes the importance of taking [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]] seriously, caring for oneself and family, and supporting those in Russia who maintain common sense, moral fortitude, and human dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.

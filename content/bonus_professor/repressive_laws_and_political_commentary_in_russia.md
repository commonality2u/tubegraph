The political climate in Russia has seen a notable increase in [[cultural_and_political_repression_in_russia | repressive policies]], particularly impacting freedom of speech and political commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These measures, described as the "power of [[repression_and_political_climate_in_russia | repressive policy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, are implemented to reinforce official narratives and suppress dissent, especially concerning the ongoing special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

## New Repressive Legislation

Significant amendments to the Criminal Code were signed by the President of the Russian Federation in mid-July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. These laws are perceived as a means to "back up with bayonets" or "legislative amendments" the "apparent support" for the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

### Specific Amendments and Penalties

The new amendments introduce severe penalties for various actions:
*   **Public calls to action against the security of Russia** are punishable by up to 7 years in prison and a fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Repeated propaganda or public demonstration of Nazi symbols or extremist organizations** can lead to up to 4 years in prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
    *   This specifically applies to entities like Facebook and Instagram, which are recognized as extremist organizations in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.
*   **Confidential cooperation with foreign countries** carries a penalty of 2 to 8 years in prison with a fine of up to one million rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This provision is broad, potentially encompassing casual interactions with foreign friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

### Rationale Behind the Laws

The adoption of these [[judicial_reform_and_political_prisoners_in_russia | repressive amendments]] to the Criminal Code is attributed to a lack of confidence in widespread public support for the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Official sources seek to enforce compliance through legal barriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

Public opinion surveys indicate a divide in support for the military operation:
*   Approximately one-third of Russians are confident that the special operation should be stopped immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   Among young people aged 18-24, 56% are in favor of stopping the operation, while only 19% support its continuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   Among Internet users, who use it as their main information source, 47% support stopping the operation, compared to 35% who favor continuing hostilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. This highlights the impact of [[media_censorship_and_freedom_of_information_in_russia | media censorship and freedom of information]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   Conversely, among respondents over 60 years old, 72% insist on continuing the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## Impact on Political Commentary

The introduction of these laws significantly increases risks for those engaged in political commentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. Even "basic political commentary" can be deemed dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. Commentators may need to moderate or suspend their activities due to the risk of being targeted by the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. This reflects the broader trend of [[human_rights_and_freedom_of_speech_in_russia | human rights and freedom of speech in Russia]] being curtailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

The speaker notes that any independent commentary is now considered dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. This [[discussion_of_repressive_practices_and_internal_politics_in_russia | discussion of repressive practices and internal politics in Russia]] highlights a shrinking space for open discourse in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>.

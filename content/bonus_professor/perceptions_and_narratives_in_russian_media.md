Valery Solovey, a political analyst and public figure, discusses how various perceptions and narratives are shaped and disseminated within Russia, particularly concerning the military-political situation and economic conditions.

## Military-Political Narratives

The Kremlin struggles to achieve a turning point in its favor in the "special military operation," a fact "clearly noticeable to all uncommitted observers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The chances of achieving a strategic turning point without using "extremely potent means" are decreasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This has led to a dilemma: either continue the operation without much chance of success or attempt to negotiate with Ukraine through the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

The Kremlin is sending both overt and covert signals to the West regarding its desired negotiation conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. These "minimal" conditions from the Kremlin's perspective include:
*   Complete control of Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   Ukraine's recognition of Crimea as Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   Donbass being independent or part of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   A land corridor to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

While some Western nations like France and Germany might be open to such conditions, with Macron even suggesting territorial concessions to Zelenskyy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, the "Saxon bloc" (Great Britain, USA, Poland, Baltic countries) advocates for "war to [a] victorious end" for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Ukraine itself feels a growing "hope that it is possible to achieve not just a turning point... but... decisive success and completely regain all the territory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The Ukrainian leadership uses "injections of patriotism [and] optimism into society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

Russia, specifically the Kremlin and Putin, "cannot leave empty-handed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, as this would mean admitting defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The term "capitulation" was used for the first time in the lexicon of Russian officials by the Russian ambassador to Washington <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. To avoid escalation and a "qualitatively new level" of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, Russia has two main instruments: mobilization and the use of "qualitatively new weapons," meaning weapons of mass destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Ministry of Defense Narratives and [[media_manipulation_and_lies_in_russian_politics|Propaganda]]

When there are no successes on the fronts, the Ministry of Defense (MoD) sends out "sensational news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Due to Russian legislation, the MoD can only be treated as a "fan" â€“ either positively or not at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

Examples of such news include:
*   The MoD, through the chief of radiation, chemical, and biological protection troops, announced an alleged attempt to infect residents of the LPR with tuberculosis using "fake bills" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Solovey draws a historical parallel to Soviet-era rumors about Americans poisoning chewing gum and cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   The MoD reported on "Pentagon's experiments in a psychiatric hospital in the Kharkov region" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   Earlier news from the MoD claimed that Ukrainian secret laboratories were not only developing dangerous disease strains but also studying migratory bird routes to "throw these headquarters" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

Solovey notes that such news appears in the "absence of other news" regarding successes and victories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. These "loud" news items are launched to draw attention but then "die a natural death," serving primarily to "occupy the information public space" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_media_on_russian_society|information control]] and [[the_influence_of_media_and_public_opinion_in_russian_politics|influence of media]] on [[public_perception_and_potential_triggers_for_sociopolitical_change_in_russia|public perception]] in Russia.

## Economic Optimism vs. Reality

Official narratives present an optimistic economic picture:
*   "We are successfully overcoming sanctions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   "Sanctions are of course to our advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   The ruble is "demonstrating the best dynamics among all currencies in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   The West has problems with "unemployment, inflation, falling GDP" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

Solovey draws an analogy to Soviet jokes about Brezhnev's speeches, where capitalism is "rolling into the abyss" while socialism is at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This "injection of optimism and economic analysis from the lips of our president" is familiar to the older generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

However, the reality behind this [[internal_political_issues_and_public_perception_in_russia|economic optimism]] is different:
*   Bloomberg reports a forecast of a 12% GDP fall in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, with a pessimistic scenario of up to 25% if Russia's isolation from world markets and oil sales is successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. This would be the most significant decline in 94 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   "All the economic achievements over the past 10 years... all the growth over the past 10 years" are being wiped out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
*   Personal incomes are falling, and prices are rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   Car sales in Russia "collapsed" by almost 80% in April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
*   AvtoVAZ is preparing to offer car models from the early 90s due to a lack of imported components, especially automotive electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.
*   "Every fifth company has begun mass layoffs," and another third are considering it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

## Promoting Patriotism

The government tries to compensate for deteriorating reality with "injections of optimism" and "injections" of patriotism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. Examples include:
*   Introducing history lessons from the first grade, which Solovey believes will turn into "political information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   Restoring the All-Union Pioneer Organization on May 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

This approach is described as the government "trying to go forward with its head turned back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Solovey posits a pattern: "the more talk about patriotism and the more calls to be patient... the worse the real state of affairs in the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. This type of "state-owned" patriotism, which calls for enduring worsening conditions, causes "rejection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

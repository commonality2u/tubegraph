The **possibility of mobilization in the Russian Federation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> became a key topic of discussion as of May 6, when this episode was recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Context of the Special Military Operation

The special military operation has entered a positional phase, characterized by skirmishes and slow advancement rather than large-scale operations like those seen in 1943 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Both Russia and Ukraine maintain the intention of achieving a strategic turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Ukraine is receiving an uninterrupted supply of military and technical resources from its Western allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Russia's military policy aimed to deplete Ukraine's resources and demoralize its society to force a peace treaty on Russia's terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. However, this goal has not been achieved, and the strategic turning point for Russia remains elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Unlike Ukraine, Russia has limited military resources, with no external assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. There are significant questions regarding the moral and psychological state of the Russian Armed Forces and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The stated goals of the operation have been rewritten multiple times, initially aiming for "denazification" and "demilitarization" of Ukraine, implying political control and regime change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Currently, a more modest task is set: complete control of Donbas and the Azov coast, with the Black Sea coast remaining a maximum task not yet started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Some high-ranking Russian military leaders doubt that even these limited goals can be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Tools for a Strategic Turning Point

To achieve a strategic turning point, two primary tools are considered:
1.  **Crushing Ukraine's armed forces through human mass**, which implies [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] of human resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
2.  Inflicting tactical nuclear strikes on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Discussion and Preparation

[[potential_mobilization_in_russia | Mobilization]] has been discussed and prepared for since the first day of the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The Security Council, under Nikolai Patrushev, is responsible for [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] preparations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Reports to Putin suggest that from an organizational and technical standpoint, everything is ready, and a mass [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] will not entail negative political consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

The speaker dismisses arguments against [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] based on technical infeasibility or political unprofitability for Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. These arguments are compared to similar ones made before February 24, which wrongly predicted no conflict with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Putin's decision-making logic is stated to be fundamentally different from that of experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

## Decision and Implementation

A decision regarding [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] has been made by the President of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. However, it is not yet certain that it will be implemented, and its timing is not yet designated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

### Proposed Plans for Mobilization

*   **Scale:** It is planned to [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | mobilize]] about half a million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Stages:** This will occur in several stages, possibly 3-4, or even ending after the first depending on the mass reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Enforcement Tools:**
    *   Military registration and enlistment office employees, possibly accompanied by police officers, will visit homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
    *   Bank cards of those subject to [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] will be blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
    *   Travel abroad will be restricted for those subject to [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

The start date, such as May 9, which was previously rumored, is merely one of the discussed options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Justification and Implications

[[potential_mobilization_in_russia | Mobilization]] must be preceded by events that, from a propaganda perspective, justify its necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. These events would aim to demonstrate that Ukraine poses an existential threat to the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Examples include:
*   Chemical attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>
*   Terrorist attacks in large Russian cities, including Moscow and St. Petersburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>

Such events would serve as a public pretext to declare "the homeland is in danger" and call "everyone to the front, everything for the front, everything for Victory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This would automatically transfer the conflict's status from a "special military operation" to a full-fledged and large-scale war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. This change in status would also legitimize the possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

## Outlook and Public Sentiment

The chances of preventing [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] are slim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. While critical public discussion might be reported to Putin by the Federal Security Service, affecting his perception of public sentiment, individual strategies for salvation are also being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

The speaker highlights a disconnect between the public perception of what "should not be" (e.g., nuclear strikes or the conflict itself) and what has already happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. He emphasizes that "other forms of thinking" with "colossal power" (in terms of decision-making) are at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

Psychological symptoms among leadership, such as hysterical statements and cynical pronouncements, indicate that "despair and anger are spread in the air" both at the top and bottom of Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. The legal aspects of [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] are to be detailed in a subsequent program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

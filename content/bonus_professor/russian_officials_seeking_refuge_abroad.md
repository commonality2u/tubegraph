Recent observations indicate that Russian officials are actively seeking "second homelands" where they can find refuge if the current regime collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. This search for safe havens stems from a perception that the situation for Russian officials is becoming increasingly "hopeless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. They reportedly can no longer rely on military victory or public support, despite propaganda of a "people's war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

## Desired Locations for Refuge

### Latin America (Deemed Unsuitable)
While a "famous political scientist" suggested [[russian_political_analysis|bases]] in Latin America, this region is largely deemed unsuitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. It is considered to be under the "predominant influence" of the United States, meaning top Russian elite would not be safe there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Although "second and third echelon officials" might potentially blend in, there are no guarantees, as the American state machine is capable of reaching them anywhere, including countries like Uruguay, Paraguay, or Ecuador <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

### Africa (Alternative Refuge)
Africa has reportedly become the new "Latin America of the middle of the last century" for Russian officials seeking refuge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. [[russian_elites_and_their_interaction_with_western_organizations|Alternate airfields]] have been established there, equipped with luxury housing, reserves of material resources, primarily currencies and precious metals, and protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. The private military company Wagner, which initially gained its reputation and operated successfully in Africa, continues to maintain a presence there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.

## Changing Behavior of Russian Officials

Amidst the challenging [[russian_political_climate|political climate]], the behavior of the Russian establishment is reportedly changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. Everyday routines in political institutions now involve alcohol consumption starting at breakfast, with additional alcohol and "amplifiers of mental processes" (drugs) during lunch to help officials "forget about the terrible present" and "even more terrible prospects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. This indicates that officials are experiencing significant stress, which they attempt to relieve through increased alcohol consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. President Putin has reportedly expressed "great dissatisfaction" with this increase in drinking among officials, both at the federal center and in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

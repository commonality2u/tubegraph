[[Chinas geopolitical stance and its impact on Russia | China's position]] regarding the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia-Ukraine conflict]], as expressed at the Munich conference, is described as very interesting and ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. [[Chinas geopolitical stance and its impact on Russia | China]] is seen as reluctantly and slowly drifting towards the position of the [[Western countries stance towards Russias leadership | Western coalition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Key Aspects of China's Position
*   **Sanctions** [[Chinas geopolitical stance and its impact on Russia | China]] categorically declares itself against unilateral sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This stance is partly attributed to concerns that the United States could impose sanctions against [[Chinas geopolitical stance and its impact on Russia | China]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Peace Plan** The [[Chinas geopolitical stance and its impact on Russia | Chinese representative]] stated that [[Chinas geopolitical stance and its impact on Russia | China]] insists on peace and is ready to present its Peace Plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This plan is based on respect for the sovereignty of both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The principle of "respect for the sovereignty of both parties" implies that [[RussiaUkraine conflict | Russia]] must renounce its territorial claims from [[ukraine_russia_conflict_analysis | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The intent to present this plan soon suggests [[Chinas geopolitical stance and its impact on Russia | China]] has been developing it for a considerable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Assessment of Russia's Victory** [[Chinas influence on Russian politics | China]], characterized as [[russiachina_relations_and_influence | Russia's]] "reliable Chinese Partner" by President [[RussiaChina relations and influence | Putin]], does not believe in the possibility of a victory for the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russian Federation]] or in the strategic genius of President [[RussiaChina relations and influence | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Conditions for a Meeting with Putin** A potential meeting between [[Chinas geopolitical stance and its impact on Russia | Comrade Xi Jinping]] and [[RussiaChina relations and influence | Putin]] was conditional on [[RussiaUkraine conflict | Russia]] achieving a decisive victory or agreeing to peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. [[Chinas influence on Russian politics | China]] now considers the option of a [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russian]] victory to be "crossed out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Warnings on Nuclear Weapons** [[Chinas geopolitical stance and its impact on Russia | Chinese comrades]] have warned [[RussiaChina relations and influence | Putin]] against the use of nuclear weapons, including at the highest level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

## Context of the Conflict
The Munich conference effectively declared a "crusade" against President [[RussiaChina relations and influence | Putin]] personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The [[Western countries stance towards Russias leadership | West]] is deliberately seeking to inflict military defeat on [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia]] and deprive it of all territorial acquisitions in [[ukraine_russia_conflict_analysis | Ukraine]], including the peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Furthermore, no threats from [[RussiaChina relations and influence | Putin]] or [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia]], including the use of nuclear weapons, will deter the [[Western countries stance towards Russias leadership | West]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. It appears [[RussiaChina relations and influence | Putin]] is being provoked to react harshly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, possibly to incite his inner circle to take decisive action to prevent "inadequate actions" by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Despite [[Russia's]] efforts, the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russian Federation]] has not achieved significant successes against [[ukraine_russia_conflict_analysis | Ukraine]], and its goals have not been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The [[ukraine_russia_conflict_analysis | Ukrainian]] military is preparing for a counteroffensive with the help of advanced [[Western countries stance towards Russias leadership | Western weapons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The [[Russia-Ukraine conflict | Russian]] military itself reportedly believes there is "practically no chance of success" in a new offensive due to low morale and an acute shortage of advanced weapons, relying on remnants of Soviet equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

[[Lukashenkos relationship with China | Lukashenko]], [[RussiaChina relations and influence | Putin's]] closest ally, also demonstrates "completely obvious disbelief" in the strategic talents of the [[RussiaChina relations and influence | Russian]] Supreme Leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. He was observed openly "trolling" the [[RussiaChina relations and influence | Russian]] president during a meeting on February 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>, highlighting a shift in the balance of power where [[RussiaChina relations and influence | Putin]] lacks confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

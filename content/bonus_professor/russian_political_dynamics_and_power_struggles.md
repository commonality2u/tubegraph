From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

This article addresses questions regarding the current [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russian internal political dynamics]] and potential power struggles, particularly in the wake of alleged leadership changes. The information presented is based on statements from Valery Solovey, given in an interview on November 2, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## Legal and Political Persecution

The Criminal Code of the Russian Federation article concerning the violent seizure and retention of power is Article 278 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. This corrects a previous mistake where Article 357 (genocide) was cited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

An incident involving former police officer Nikolai Korolev is highlighted as an example of political persecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Korolev is facing legal action for asking law enforcement to check statements made by propagandist Simonyan about a nuclear strike over Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. Despite the quote being widely circulated by media and bloggers, only Korolev is being prosecuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

## [[russian_political_crisis_and_power_transition | Political Crisis and Power Transition]]

There are strong assertions made regarding a change in leadership and its implications for [[potential_political_transition_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | potential political transition and power dynamics in Russia]].

### Alleged Death of the President and FSO Exercises
The speaker is inclined to believe that the president died on the evening of October 26th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

The Federal Protective Service (FSO) conducted exercises from November 1st to 3rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. Despite being regular, the speaker associates these exercises, especially the emphasis on their routine nature and the possibility of using armored vehicles, with the alleged death of the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

### Current Leadership and Power Dynamics
According to the speaker, Nikolai Patrushev's team has now come to power and is the "supreme ruler of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. This new leadership is expected to "tighten the screws" on social networks, particularly on the eve of a power transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. The speaker states that power must be transferred from a "double" as a double cannot lead Russia for long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

Patrushev is described as someone who "hates the oligarchs" and "hates Putin's entourage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:08:00">[20:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>.

### The Role of Doubles
A study, partly published by *The Moscow Times* (republished from *The Daily Mail* and *The Sun* with reference to Japanese researchers), supports the presence of "doubles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. This study included an anthropological examination and a phonoscopic examination, the latter being considered as reliable as fingerprints, confirming the existence of doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

One double, referred to as "Vasilich," replaces the president after his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:29:00">[24:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:31:00">[24:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>. There is also a "technical double" used for public appearances where the president does not need to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:37:00">[24:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:00">[24:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:00">[24:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>. The Federal Protective Service (FSO) controls this technical double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:51:00">[24:51:00]</a>.

### Key Political Figures and Their Roles
*   **Prigozhin:** Expected to return after the president's death, choosing the most suitable moment, likely during an internecine struggle for power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.
*   **Kadyrov:** Kadyrov is aware of what happened in the Kremlin and plans to play his own game against the current [[russian_political_dynamics_amidst_leadership_changes | Russian political dynamics amidst leadership changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:06:00">[21:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:08:00">[21:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:13:00">[21:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:16:00">[21:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>. He is receiving heavy weapons from the Wagner private military company to equip two new battalions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:34:00">[21:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:44:00">[21:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>.
*   **Shoigu:** Desires to seize power but is not capable, and no elite groups would support him due to skeptical and hostile attitudes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:07:00">[24:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:00">[24:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:14:00">[24:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19:00">[24:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:21:00">[24:21:00]</a>.

## External Awareness of [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | Political Figures and Power Dynamics in Russia]]
The West, China, and Israel are allegedly aware of the events in Russia and are satisfied with the current state of affairs, interested in maintaining the current regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>.

Ukrainian leadership and intelligence may not make statements due to fear of making a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:00">[13:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. Ukrainian intelligence is noted as not very good at strategic political intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>. They may also be afraid that if the information about the president's death is confirmed, the dynamics of peace negotiations would change, as the president was seen as a major obstacle to peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.

## Call to Action for Political Change
To change the regime to a democratic, European reality, people need to participate in a mass movement, and "go to the end without stopping" when the opportunity arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. There is no turning back once actions are taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

> "If they have already taken to the square if they have taken to the streets to stand and achieve their goal until Victory there is no other way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

For victory, people must be ready to go to the square at the necessary day and hour <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:01:00">[17:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:04:00">[17:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:06:00">[17:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:12:00">[17:12:00]</a>. The speaker expresses optimism about the future ability to influence the fate of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:41:00">[25:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:44:00">[25:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:49:00">[25:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:00">[25:52:00]</a>.

The future of real estate and currency markets in Moscow is subject to significant uncertainty, with predictions largely dependent on the duration and nature of an anticipated political and economic crisis in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Exact information on these matters is not available, and forecasts are based on assumptions and general economic logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## General Outlook

A serious [[political_and_economic_crisis_in_russias_future | political crisis]] is anticipated in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. During such a crisis, people typically seek to invest in defensive assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Currency Trends

Currencies, particularly foreign ones, are considered a primary defensive asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. From this perspective, currencies are expected to rise in price during the unfolding crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. However, if the crisis is relatively short-lived, currency values will most likely remain at the same level or decrease once the crisis subsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Gold is also mentioned as a defensive asset, though it comes with many problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Real Estate Trends

Real estate is not considered a defensive asset in the current scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Predictions indicate that real estate prices will likely go down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The demand for real estate has already begun to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

If the crisis turns out to be relatively short-lived, real estate is expected to begin rising in price again as the country exits the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Advice for Property Owners

The speaker emphasizes that any decision made should be at one's own peril and risk, as these are general assumptions and not investment recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Specific circumstances significantly influence individual decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

*   **Selling Now**: If an individual plans to leave Russia permanently or for an extended period, it may be advisable to sell real estate now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The declining demand for real estate could make future sales more challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Holding Property**: For those prepared to hold their property, take risks, or engage in a long-term strategy (a couple of years or more), holding real estate might ultimately prove beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Broader Context

The speaker links these [[prospects_of_real_estate_investment_in_moscow | economic forecasts]] to a broader [[political_and_economic_crisis_in_russias_future | political crisis]] expected to unfold in Russia, possibly intensifying from late spring/early March and stretching into autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This period is expected to include "decisive military events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. The year 2023 is described as having every chance to become a decisive year for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

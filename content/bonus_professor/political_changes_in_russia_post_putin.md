Valery Solovey, in the 12th episode of his "Answers to Hot Questions" program, discussed various aspects of potential political changes in Russia, particularly in the context of a post-Putin era.

## Outlook on Leadership and Power Dynamics

The outcome of the military conflict in Ukraine is expected to be predetermined before summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. However, this does not mean an automatic cessation of military actions, which may continue by "fading inertia" in attempts to find a political solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

After the departure of the current Russian president, the future course of [[political_transition_in_russia | political transition]] and military actions will depend on who comes to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. If a particular "force" that Solovey considers the "most likely contenders" comes to power, military actions will not automatically cease and might even experience some short-term intensification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This force would need to bargain for the best conditions for leaving Ukraine and ending the armed confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Solovey dismisses the possibility of a "conditionally Korean version" (frozen conflict leading to deep self-isolation and degradation for Russia) as "extremely low, tending to zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Putin's Health and Public Appearances

Solovey has stated for the past two years that Vladimir Putin has doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. He noted that in February, the "behavior pattern" of Putin speaking before the Federal Assembly and Putin at the Luzhniki concert were "different behavior patterns of different people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Photographs circulating online support this observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Journalist Alexander Minkin has also publicly claimed dealing with a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This is described as a "common shared opinion" among the Russian elite, and the main part of the president's staff has known about it for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

It is anticipated that in March, after undergoing another course of treatment, Putin's speeches will mostly be online, while his double will appear in public "for at least some time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

Information about Putin's health and the use of doubles, despite attempts to hide it, has leaked due to the large number of people in the president's staff and security, as well as their relatives and assistants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Solovey asserts that "main Western intelligence agencies are aware of the state of health of the Russian president" and factor this into their military-political plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

The process of Putin "disappearing" from domestic and international politics has been delayed but is ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>. His international influence is now "of little value," even Lukashenko publicly trolls him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>. If doubles increasingly replace him in domestic politics, his significant role will diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>.

## Future of Russia and [[possible_future_political_changes_in_russia | Political Change]]

Solovey believes Russia is "not doomed to repetition of bad" leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. He states that an opportunity to prove this will arise "with a very high probability...already in 2023" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. He urges those ready to work for their destiny and the future of their children and grandchildren to "do something at least a little" to change their fate and the country's fate for the better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. A "clear and distinct signal" will indicate when it is time to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Disintegration Risks
The disintegration of Russia is not expected to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. Theoretically, it is possible only if the [[political_changes_and_power_dynamics_in_postPutin_russia | political crisis]] becomes "very long and very fierce," potentially lasting about three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. While risks of internal weakening and moderate separatist tendencies exist, "fundamental risks of Russia's collapse" are not present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

### Elections
Solovey "very much doubts that there will be elections in 2024" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. He states that the question of whether elections will be held and "who will go to them" will be decided in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

### Public Agency
When asked if the Russian people will choose real democracy, freedom, and peace, Solovey emphasizes that "what is important...is the practice of action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>. He urges people to start acting to change their destiny and the country's destiny, as "a sense of responsibility will not form" until they begin doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

### Financial Stability
The financial block, including Nabiullina and Siluanov, is credited with "highly successful" work in saving Russia from a financial catastrophe in the past year and early this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. However, a financial catastrophe is not ruled out, only delayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Nabiullina's assessment reportedly indicates the "safety margin" of the financial system will "probably last until summer," with "very serious problems" expected in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### Post-Defeat Scenario
Solovey doubts that a defeat for Russia in the conflict would lead to "national humiliation" and "revanchist sentiments" similar to Germany after World War I, which brought Nazis to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. He notes that the peace conditions being prepared by the West "have no hint of national humiliation" because the West has learned from historical experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

### Nuclear Threat
Solovey does not exclude a nuclear outcome of the war, as the "Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Federation leaves this option acceptable for himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. However, he highlights the uncertainty of whether such an order would be carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. He considers even a 1-2% probability of execution "disproportionately much for all of us and for the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>.

### Role of the Constitutional Court
The Constitutional Court and "practically all judges" are expected to bear "direct political responsibility" for the current situation in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Solovey hopes they will bear "not only political responsibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

### The Year 2023
Solovey believes that "2023 has every chance of being the year when the fate of Russia and ours will begin to change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>. He anticipates "internal dynamics" to develop by the end of March or early April, promising to share more about it then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Solovey's personal perspective on [[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | sociopolitical changes]] in Russia is that his "strength, energy, and all my talents...will be dedicated and thrown into solving practical problems" of changing life in Russia and Russia itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. He aims to "transfer the greatest benefit to my people and my country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>.

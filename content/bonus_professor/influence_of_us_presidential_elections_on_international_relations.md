The US presidential elections are considered the most important elections in the world, and a lot depends on their outcome for global peace and [[influence_of_international_relations_on_russian_politics|international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Most countries react to these elections and determine their positions in relation to the results, given the United States' continued leading role in global affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Russian Reaction to US Elections

The Russian leadership, including the Kremlin, pays close attention to the results of US elections, as they influence both Russian domestic and [[influence_of_international_relations_on_russian_politics|international policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Congratulations to Trump
Immediately following the US elections, on November 6, two elite Russian coalitions, led by Chemezov and Patrushev respectively, sent "enthusiastic congratulations" to Donald Trump through informal channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This information was reported by the SVR general telegram channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Trump's Response to Russia
Trump responded to both messages on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. His reply consistently referred to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as an "incident" that it was time to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This perspective reveals much about what can be described as Trump's foreign policy views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Kremlin's Peace Proposals to Trump
During informal communications, the Russian side proposed a "truce" as a necessary preliminary stage for peace negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This idea's essence was detailed in a November 7 speech by Valery Solovey, which he describes as more insightful than Putin's Valdai Forum speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

On November 7, a conversation took place between Trump and the "so-called" President of Russia, reported by the Washington Post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Trump asked who the decision-maker was on the Russian side, and he was told to speak with "Yevgeny Vasilyevich," who calls himself Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

The Kremlin's proposed contours for a peace settlement are as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>:
*   Crimea remains with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   Donetsk and Luhansk regions, within their administrative borders, remain with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   In exchange, Ukraine would concede the Kursk region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   Russia would give up territory fragments it controls in the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   Crucially, the Kremlin took a step back on its previous demand for a land corridor to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Instead, it proposed abandoning the land corridor if Ukraine guaranteed unimpeded transit of goods and people from mainland Russia to Crimea through Ukrainian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

Trump paused and stated he could not comment offhand, indicating he would consider and discuss the proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The leak of this conversation suggests that some in Trump's circle evaluate these proposals as unrealistic or undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Trump's Foreign Policy Ambitions and Challenges

In Trump's worldview, Ukraine plays a subordinate position, and his approach is primarily guided by commercial logic, like a businessman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Constraints on Presidential Power
Despite significant presidential powers, the American president is not a dictator, even with a Republican-controlled Congress and Supreme Court <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Trump will have to contend with his own party officials who may have different views on the [[potential_military_actions_and_geopolitical_influences|conflict between Russia and Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Key positions influencing foreign policy include Secretary of State, Assistant to the President for National Security, and Secretary of Defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The head of the CIA also holds some significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

### The "Deep State" Influence
During Trump's first presidency (2016-2020), the "Deep State"—the Washington bureaucracy—blocked numerous initiatives and decisions it deemed detrimental or dangerous to the United States' role in the [[influence_of_international_relations_on_russian_politics|international arena]] and American [[influence_of_international_relations_on_russian_politics|international leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This "Deep State" still exists and can influence policy during Trump's potential second and final term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

### Trump's Motivations
As this would be his last term, Trump is expected to seek "epochal" achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. Beyond domestic policy goals like economic growth and migration restriction, he wants to make his mark on the [[influence_of_international_relations_on_russian_politics|international arena]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. He has already stated his desire to be a "president of peace" rather than a "president of war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Acting as a "peacemaker winner," rather than a leader overseeing a withdrawal like in Afghanistan or a civil war in Iraq, would be an epochal achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. He might even secretly aspire to a Nobel Peace Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>, demonstrating a strong motivation to establish peace driven by his economic-centric policy in [[influence_of_international_relations_on_russian_politics|international relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

Trump, as president of the most powerful country, has the potential to influence and even pressure both sides of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## Concerns Regarding the Russian "Double"

The speech of the "so-called Putin" at the Valdai Forum holds little significance for Russian officials, as they know it is a double and treat it ironically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. During his hour-long speech, the "president" misspoke or mispronounced words 44 times, repeated words 29 times, made long pauses 12 times, and had noticeable slips of the tongue three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. The "double," identified as Yevgeny Vasilyevich, is described as uneducated and unintelligent, facing an "insurmountable intellectual challenge" that rehearsals cannot overcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

These frequent linguistic errors and inability to pronounce certain phrases stem from a "serious root cause" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. It is known that his career as president is ending, and Politburo 2 has decided to conclude this "tragicomic" situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. He is promised a secure, privileged life, but being aware of whom he is dealing with, the double is worried about his survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

The 17th episode of Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, recorded on June 19, focuses on two main issues: negotiations in Kyiv and changes in the Russian political landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Visit of the "Big Three"

Last week, expectations surrounding the visit of European leaders (Italy's Mario Draghi, France's Emmanuel Macron, and Germany's Olaf Scholz) to Kyiv largely revolved around their supposed aim to persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to engage in [[peace_negotiations_with_ukraine | peace talks with Russia]] and accept territorial compromises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. These expectations were reportedly justified, as discussions behind the scenes were indeed focused on this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

According to sources, Macron and Scholz were the primary persuaders, allegedly because the [[Kremlins_diplomatic_strategies_with_ukraine_and_the_west | Kremlin]] possessed "serious, reliable, and sensitive dirt" on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Draghi's role was described as an "extra," merely nodding in agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Unexpected Outcome

However, the public statement issued after the negotiations was directly opposite to the initial intention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. It declared unconditional support for Ukraine's position, including its territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. It was also made clear that [[peace_negotiations_with_ukraine | peace negotiations]] would not commence until Ukraine achieved some success on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

The shift in position is attributed to several factors:
*   **Zelenskyy's tough stance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Strong positions from the US, Great Britain, and many NATO countries**, which favor preparing conditions for [[potential_peace_negotiations_involving_russia_and_ukraine | peace negotiations]] through battlefield gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **The "psycho-emotional impact" on the visiting leaders** after their visit to Irpin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Western Support and Future Prospects

Following the "Big Three" visit, Boris Johnson's trip to Kyiv reinforced unconditional solidarity with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. The crucial element, beyond declarations, is the provision of substantial and high-quality military assistance that would enable Ukraine to achieve at least equality with the Russian Federation, potentially leading to a strategic turn on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Such assistance can only be provided by the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

The US appears ready to provide this aid despite the risk of escalating conflict with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The expected arrival of weapons, along with trained personnel, is anticipated in July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. If this occurs, significant qualitative changes on the battlefield could be observed by the end of July or early August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

David Arakhamia, head of Ukraine's negotiating group, recently stated that Ukraine might resume [[potential_peace_proposals_between_russia_and_ukraine | negotiations with Russia]] by the end of August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. This timing is based on his calculation that Ukraine's negotiating position would be strengthened by then, not only due to new weapons and professionally trained soldiers but also significant changes on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. These changes could include the return of Kherson under Ukrainian control and a counteroffensive in Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

However, the resumption of [[peace_negotiations_with_ukraine | peace talks]] does not necessarily mean peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Both Boris Johnson and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg have called on NATO countries to prepare for a long campaign, involving multi-year military assistance, support for state infrastructure, and aid in Ukraine's restoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Kremlin's Perspective

From the [[Kremlins_view_on_peace_with_ukraine | Kremlin]]'s side, there is an apparent desire to achieve some result by late autumn or early winter, reaching a final stage in the armed confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This urgency is linked to internal political dynamics and the health of President Putin, as a decision regarding the transfer of power, or "transit of power," might begin in late autumn or early winter, possibly even earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. In this scenario, the ongoing military operation would become an impediment to primary political tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Putin's Public Appearances

Vladimir Putin's speech at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum was widely perceived as difficult to take seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The speaker likened it to a classic Soviet joke where a translator only spoke two phrases to convey the entire meaning of Brezhnev's long speech: "started chatting" and "finished chatting, you can applaud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The speaker also noted the "wolfish expressions" on the faces of gathered businessmen during Putin's speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Emergence of an Elite Coalition

A significant development is the formation of an "anti-Chekist" or "anti-Patrushevsky" coalition within the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This marks a shift from previously hypothetical discussions of elite splits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

Key figures allegedly forming this coalition include:
*   Roman Abramovich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>
*   Anatoly Chubais <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
*   Vladimir Potanin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>
*   Oleg Deripaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> (noted for demonstratively not applauding Putin at the forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>)
*   The "Yeltsin family" is also associated with Deripaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

This coalition opposes Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev's attempt to position his son, Minister of Agriculture Dmitry Patrushev, as Putin's successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This "sounding" has met with extreme resistance from oligarchs, civilians, and even elements within the security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. The struggle has begun against the security group maintaining power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

This group reportedly views Finance Minister Anton Siluanov as a potential president and Elvira Nabiullina, head of the Central Bank, as head of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This indicates a clear confrontation between civilians and security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. The "struggle for Putin's Russia" has started, intensifying as the elite realizes Putin will soon have to leave his position or significantly weaken his public presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

This emerging coalition is currently situational, but its class closeness and a potential common view of Russia's future are uniting factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. This signals the opening of a "hunting season" within the elite, including for those perceived as threats or whose departure could serve as a signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The strange deaths of oil workers in recent months are cited as examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

The speaker urges viewers to observe this process not as passive spectators but as interested observers, and later, as participants, to influence Russia's historical trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. He emphasizes that the process of conflict within the elites has begun and will open opportunities for active Russian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. While the coming months will be difficult and painful for Russia, the speaker concludes with a message of hope for victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

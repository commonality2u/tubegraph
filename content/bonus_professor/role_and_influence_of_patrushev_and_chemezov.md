The [[internal_politics_and_power_dynamics_in_russian_leadership | internal politics and power dynamics in Russian leadership]] are significantly influenced by various groups, notably those led by [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Nikolai Patrushev]] and Sergey Chemezov. These two figures lead prominent coalitions with distinct views on Russia's future and internal governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Chemezov's Influence

Sergey Chemezov is associated with a "Chemezov tower" which includes high-ranking officers of the FSB and the foreign intelligence service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Chemezov is noted for having "excellent relations" with the foreign intelligence service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This relationship is implied to facilitate the acquisition of Western technological achievements for Russia, as described by the late Putin's saying: "they did something we tsap-tsap and it is already ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Chemezov's group advocates for a "very broad and very flexible compromise" regarding the end of the war, in contrast to Patrushev's more rigid stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## Patrushev's Influence

[[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Patrushev]] is a central figure within the ruling group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. He was the Secretary of the Security Council, which hosts a team of analysts whose forecasts largely coincide with the speaker's predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. These analysts provide reports describing problems the Russian Federation will face, and Patrushev then seeks solutions based on his "own worldview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. However, there are "people who block" his proposed solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Not all FSB officers are guided by [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Patrushev]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Key Positions and Actions:
*   **Succession/Transit of Power:** [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Patrushev]] insisted on a quick transition of power ("Transit") after Putin's death, aiming for it to be completed before January 1, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. However, groups opposing him within the ruling coalition were "categorically against" this swift transition, leading to disagreements that prevented immediate consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **End of War:** [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Patrushev]]'s opinion is that a peace agreement should be concluded based on recognizing the "territorial status quo," meaning the current front line would become the new border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   **Role of Doubles:** Unlike Putin, [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Patrushev]] is not believed to have prepared a double for himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

## Current Dynamics and Politburo 2.0

The speaker claims that the coalitions of [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Patrushev]] and Chemezov now wield "strong influence on the agenda inside the country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. While they were unable to agree on a quick "Transit" previously, they "seem to have reached some kind of agreement" now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. The actual outcome is expected to become clear by late summer or early autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

The ruling group, referred to as "Politburo 2.0," conducts general decision-making via video conference due to mutual dislike and avoidance of personal meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

The State Duma is described as a "weak-willed and pathetic appendage of the executive power," effectively a "department of the presidential administration" that will comply with the wishes of [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Patrushev]] and Chemezov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>.

The confrontation between [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Patrushev]] and Chemezov cannot be accelerated or aggravated by external interference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

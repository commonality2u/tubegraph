The future of Russia, according to Valery Solovey, involves significant [[possible_future_political_changes_in_russia | political and social reforms]], changes in governance, and shifts in its economic and international standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. These changes are influenced by internal elite struggles and external pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Political Landscape and Governance

### Elite Coalitions and Leadership
The political landscape is characterized by ongoing struggles between elite coalitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Patrushev Group** – This group is described as having initiated public reprimands against figures like Denis Manturov, utilizing a double of the Russian president (identified as Evgeny Vasilyevich) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This group desires to end military actions with Ukraine on more "militant conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Chemezov Group** – This group has reportedly prevented a new wave of mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a> and the use of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. They have also prevented "many extremely dangerous things" from occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The speaker himself claims to have played a modest part in blocking undesirable plans, such as the potential appointment of Viktor Khmari as acting Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Potential Future Leadership
*   **Denis Manturov** – Despite public attacks, Manturov is considered by the speaker to be a potential candidate for president, possibly "even better than Putin" due to his human and professional qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. Public opinion is not expected to be a significant factor in his potential appointment, as it has not been for the past 30 years in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>.
*   **Presidential Double** – The "double of the Russian president" is identified as Evgeny Vasilyevich and is supervised by the presidential security service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Transparency and Public Awareness
The truth about the current government and its actions is expected to become widely known, with evidence and witnesses to be presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. However, a significant part of society may not believe it due to a fear of thinking and a reluctance to accept a truth that "destroys the picture of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. It is predicted that "from all the boxes," the truth will be told as early as next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>.

### [[internal_reforms_and_future_of_russian_governance | Internal Reforms and Future of Russian Governance]]
A change of government, including a new Prime Minister, has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Judicial Reform** – The judicial system will undergo a "complete lustration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.
*   **New Leadership Principles** – The speaker expresses confidence in a future leadership team that will work for the good of society and build a system of control to prevent corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:11">[00:43:11]</a>. This team rejects the principle of exploiting the people ("people - it's a sponge press harder and squeeze out everything") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. They prioritize collective well-being and seek to enrich themselves through the growth of public wealth, not at its expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. The concept for such a system, based on democratic principles and checks and balances, is reportedly ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:26">[00:47:26]</a>.
*   **Law Enforcement** – Those who have broken the law will be held accountable according to the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that everything must be "according to the law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

### Inflation and Currency
Official inflation figures are questioned, with an alternative estimate of 90% inflation over three years (from 2012 to the end of 2015), contrary to the official 28-29% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. Prices are predicted to accelerate their growth in the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Dollar Exchange Rate** – The Central Bank management reportedly predicted a dollar cost of 120 rubles by the end of the year, with forecasts for 150 rubles in the first half of the next year, not excluding 200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
*   **Currency Purchase Advice** – If one has money, buying foreign currency (dollars or euros) is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. New dollars are preferable, as older ones might not be accepted in places like the Emirates or Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

### Financial Measures and Restrictions
*   **Freezing Deposits** – There is discussion of freezing deposits, with the idea currently postponed until spring/summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. If implemented, conditions might be introduced where amounts up to 1,400 are not touched, potentially gaining public support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. Details regarding limits on salaries and accounts are still being debated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.
*   **Foreign Investors** – There are efforts to prevent negative actions against foreign investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency** – The Russian authorities are not preparing to arrest or confiscate cryptocurrency as they widely use it themselves to circumvent sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>. All crypto transactions, especially those exceeding $20, are recorded and under the control of the FSB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:34">[00:48:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.
*   **Bookmakers** – Bookmakers are expected to survive any financial reforms, as they generate "colossal profits" and no one wants to fight them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

### Demographic Policies
A decision was made in fall 2023 to begin mass fertility tests for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. If married, fertile women of childbearing age persist in their unwillingness to have children, they will be sent for psychiatric examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. As of Fall, 3 million people have already been tested for fertility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Education and Healthcare
Extensive, massive, and comprehensive actions will be taken to reform education and healthcare systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. While full changes will take 10-15 years, initial positive steps could be felt within the first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.

### Retirement Age and Compensation
Upon coming to power, the new leadership is considering returning to the previous retirement age and compensating those who did not receive their pension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

### Legal Reforms
*   **Yarovaya Package** – There are plans for the cancellation of the "Yarovaya package," which mandates telecommunication operators to store user internet traffic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.
*   **Travel Bans** – A significant part of travel bans imposed by the bailiff service will be lifted due to tax and other amnesties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>.
*   **Combating Fraud** – There is a 100% chance to strengthen the fight against fraudulent schemes, as the protectors of these schemes are known and it would take up to six months to stop mass telephone calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.

### Return to the "Civilized World"
This involves shedding illusions and removing the current "embezzlers and scoundrels" who govern Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>. The "civilized world" is defined as a place:
*   Where people are not morally and psychologically raped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.
*   Where their private lives (bed, correspondence) are not intruded upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.
*   Where they are not interfered with in their work and business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>.
*   Where people are not encouraged to participate in mass murder or sent to be killed under the guise of patriotism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>.
*   Where women are respected and animals valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>.
*   Where there are good roads and a good attitude towards people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>.
*   Where pensioners receive more than 16,000 rubles in a country rich in natural resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>.
*   Where the level of social security is comparable to Central European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.
It implies a normal, decent, peaceful human life, free from constant violence against one's own people and attempts to spread violence globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

### Public Services and Infrastructure
Toll roads and clinics will continue to exist, but a free, high-quality alternative must always be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>.

## Foreign Relations and War

### Ukraine Conflict and Ceasefire
The "Kremlin towers" (elite factions) desire to end military actions with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[00:39:52]</a>. However, one "power or Chekist" tower seeks more militant conditions than the "pragmatist and realist" tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Plans for a peace agreement or truce with Ukraine remain in force, though their implementation terms may shift due to circumstances like military escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The American side is sending signals that they will not tolerate delays in reaching a truce and are prepared to use blackmail to force Russia to conclude one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Mariupol
The fate of Mariupol, in future plans, will be dictated by the plans of elected President Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.

### US-Kremlin Deal Rumors
A version suggesting a deal between the USA and the Kremlin for Putin to "metastasize in Syria" in return for Russian conquests in Ukraine is deemed "100% wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.

### Relations with Ukraine
There was a "great chance" for Russia and Ukraine to have a more friendly, good-neighborly relationship that would have benefited both countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>. This chance depended more on Russia, or specifically "the Kremlin," which chose not to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>.

## Notable Figures and Predictions

*   **Valery Solovey:** The speaker, Valery Solovey, hosts a program called "Answers to Hot Questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. He maintains that some predictions are subject to "transient circumstances" or "variables" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. However, he states that certain decisions, like the military action against Ukraine in February-March 2022, were spoken of with "absolute certainty" because the plan was known not to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. He also asserts that "exposed cards do not play," suggesting that sometimes information is leaked to prevent certain decisions from being implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Golikova:** Is held in her position by the system to serve as a lightning rod for public discontent, an "enemy of the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:22">[00:30:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Sergei Lavrov & Konstantin Ernst:** Are cited as examples of individuals whose "worst qualities" have manifested and dominated over positive ones due to their loyalty to the regime, with their appearances reflecting these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:47">[00:35:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>.
*   **Yevgeny Prigozhin:** Is reported to be "alive and well" and able to visit Europe, sometimes being in "dangerous proximity to the territory of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:52]</a>. He will come onto the stage when he deems it desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.
*   **Assad & Yanukovych:** The Kremlin needs Assad due to the "130 billion dollars" he paid for political asylum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:42">[00:45:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:09]</a>. Yanukovych similarly paid billions of dollars, part of which financed Russian military operations in Donbass from 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.
*   **Outlook for 2025:** The year 2025 is predicted to be harder for Russia than the outgoing year, while 2026 is hoped to be easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. Radical changes for the better are hoped for next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.
*   **Moscow Government Security:** Working in Sobyanin's security is deemed safe, as guards are expected to "just run away in all directions" when changes begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:20">[00:37:20]</a>. Individuals are advised to be on the "right side of history" when such a choice arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a>.

## Conclusion

The speaker emphasizes that while the times ahead will be "very difficult" and "sad," Russia will "cope" and "survive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>. He expresses certainty that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.

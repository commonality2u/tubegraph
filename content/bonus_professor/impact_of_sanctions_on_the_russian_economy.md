The conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which began on February 24, 2022, has become the dominant factor in Russian politics and is expected to shape events in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. The ongoing military actions, coupled with [[impacts_of_war_and_sanctions_on_russia | international sanctions]], are having a significant and increasingly severe impact on Russia's economy and society.

## Strengthening Sanctions and Economic Degradation

The West has clearly indicated its intention to strengthen [[economic_sanctions_and_their_effects_on_russia | sanctions]] against Russia, making them "more and more sensitive" and "more and more difficult for the Russian economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. As the Russian economy attempts to adapt to one set of [[impact_and_adaptation_to_international_sanctions_on_russia | sanctions]], another will follow, potentially leading to a "lower level of technological development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. This trend suggests a broader "degradation of the technological degradation of the Russian economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

## Impact on Big Business and Oligarchs

The tightening of [[the_impact_of_western_and_european_sanctions_on_russia | sanctions]] is causing significant nervousness among big business in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Assets of [[russian_oligarchs_and_sanctions | Russian oligarchs]] in Western countries are being seized and are not expected to be returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. This situation has led to discussions within Russia's security environment and among those close to the president about potentially nationalizing large assets of private corporations and firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## Elite Disorganization and Future Outlook

The overall situation, including the [[effects_and_management_of_sanctions_on_russia | impact of sanctions]], is contributing to increasing tension and disorganization within the ranks of Russia's security forces, top bureaucracy, and big business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. There is a "mass feeling" of exhaustion of the historical period known as the "Putin era," which is likely "coming to an end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. The highest elites are reportedly confused and do not know how to navigate the deteriorating situation, anticipating a "very sad outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

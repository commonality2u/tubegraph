The current climate in Russia is characterized by an intensive and increasingly tense, hysterical atmosphere, particularly within the establishment and among some segments of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This [[political_situation_in_russia | political situation in Russia]] is leading the country towards the introduction of full or partial martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, which would significantly curtail existing civil liberties.

## Imminent Martial Law and its Implications

Russia is moving quickly towards implementing martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, despite martial law already being in effect in the "new territories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The Secretary of the Security Council, Patrushev, has demanded the president immediately impose martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This extension would apply to the Russian capital, frontline regions, and potentially other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

The president has postponed this decision, potentially until after May 9th, due to the desire to hold a parade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Additionally, the introduction of martial law would diminish the president's power in favor of security officers who would control its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Amendments were introduced on May 3rd, 2023, to the Federal Constitutional Law on martial law to allow elections in the so-called new regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. The actual implementation of martial law or its elements might occur without a formal declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

## Restrictions on Civil Rights and Freedoms

Martial law is defined as a set of restrictions on civil rights and freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Even without formal martial law, elements of it are being implemented, leading to increased anxiety and tension within the [[russian_political_climate | Russian political climate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Key restrictions include:

*   **Travel Ban for Military Personnel:** For those subject to military service (over 15 million people in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>), martial law would likely entail a ban on travel outside the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Movement Restrictions:** Restrictions on movement between a number of regions can be introduced, alongside strengthened passport control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Freedom of Speech:** There would be a restriction of freedom of speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Internment:** The possibility of internment, meaning detention without trial or investigation for up to 30 days (which can be extended), exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Conscription:** The introduction of martial law elements would make conscription much easier to carry out, potentially ignoring formal restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Mass checks on those liable for military service are already starting in some cities, with escorts to military enlistment offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Financial Restrictions:** It is theoretically possible to block bank cards and accounts for those potentially liable for military service or mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The Central Bank has reported readiness for this, despite financial authorities not being delighted with the prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

## Public and Official Reactions

A "mania for searching and detecting Ukrainian drones" has swept Moscow and the Moscow region, leading to hundreds of calls to authorities, many of which are "absolute nonsense" driven by fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. In response, Moscow authorities ordered public utilities to monitor airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The Moscow Mayor banned all drone launches on May 3rd, 2023, except for "competent ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Local authorities will play a significant role in determining the scope of restrictions implemented under martial law, as they will agree on the set of measures to be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Moscow Mayor Sobyanin, for example, is expected to try and protect Moscow citizens to maintain their loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This highlights a dynamic between security officers and local authorities that will impact the implementation of these measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

The events, while horrific, are seen as moving in a "right direction" towards "liberation," "justice," and a "different quality life" for the renewal of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

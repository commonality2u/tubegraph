Recent legal amendments in Russia have significantly altered the process of receiving military summonses, equating electronic notifications with traditional paper ones and introducing new restrictions for those who fail to comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. These changes are seen as a step towards formalizing the legal status and consequences of [[mobilization_laws_and_categories_of_conscription | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, affecting a large number of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Equivalence of Electronic and Paper Summonses

Previously, a military summons required physical receipt and a signature to be considered officially delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Under the new amendments, an electronic summons is now equivalent to a paper one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Automatic Receipt via Public Services Account

An electronic summons is considered automatically received the moment it is posted in the personal account of the person liable for military service on public services platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This applies to all persons liable for military service, not just conscripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. If an individual has a personal account on public services, they are considered notified of the summons from the moment it is posted there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

*   **Note:** This rule is explicitly stated not to apply to the spring draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Restrictive Measures for Non-Compliance

The amendments expand restrictive measures for those who do not appear in response to a summons, affecting all those liable for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Immediate Restrictions

If a person does not appear voluntarily within two weeks of the summons being digitally signed by the military commissar, a notification of restrictions is introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. The primary immediate restriction is a ban on leaving the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Further Restrictions After 20 Days

If the individual still does not appear after 20 days, additional restrictions are imposed. These include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>:
*   Prohibition from driving vehicles; driving licenses are formally canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   Inability to conclude real estate transactions (e.g., buying or selling an apartment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   Inability to register as an individual entrepreneur (IE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This may also extend to a ban on engaging in economic activity as an IE if already registered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   Ban on taking out loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   Likely blocking of bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

These measures are intended to compel individuals to fulfill their civic and patriotic duty by appearing for military service in case of [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Personal Preparedness and Response Strategies

Given these changes, individuals liable for military service are advised to consider [[preparation_and_response_strategies_for_potential_military_drafts | strategies]] to mitigate potential negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Managing Public Services Accounts

Since electronic summonses are linked to public services accounts, one option is to consider closing such an account, which can be done remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. If an account is closed, an electronic summons will not be sent, or rather, it won't reach the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

### Property and Financial Planning

General powers of attorney, which were previously used to manage affairs during [[mobilization_laws_and_categories_of_conscription | partial mobilization]], are unlikely to be effective against these new restrictions, as the bans directly concern the individual's rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Individuals are advised to consider transferring rights to their assets (e.g., car, property) to highly trusted individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>, though this carries significant risks and should be done only after consulting with qualified lawyers to understand the irreversible [[legal_restrictions_related_to_military_service | legal consequences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

### Calmness and Planning

It is crucial to remain calm and avoid panic, as there is still some time, at least until the May holidays, to take meaningful action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Individuals should develop multiple plans and options for how to act if a critical decision regarding [[potential_mobilization_and_military_service_changes_in_russia | mobilization]] is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Discussion with family and friends and agreement on mutual assistance are also recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

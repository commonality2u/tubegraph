Valery Solovey's 48th episode discusses the [[general_gerasimovs_strategy_for_counteroffensives | demobilization chord of General Gerasimov]] and the unfolding military situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The overall military situation in connection with relations between Russia and Ukraine is described as "getting worse and worse every day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Appointment of General Gerasimov

General Gerasimov was appointed Chief of the General Staff and commander of a group of Russian troops in the special military operation zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This appointment occurred despite a "spectacular victory" of the Russian armed forces in capturing Soledar after an assault that began in August, which is noted as significantly longer than the time it took to capture Berlin in WWII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Reasons for Appointment
The appointment of General Gerasimov is attributed to two main reasons:
1.  **Military Necessity:** [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Vladimir Putin]] understands that the "special war" needs to end victoriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Gerasimov is considered "the best Russian General, an excellent planner, a person with strategic thinking, the author of the concept of hybrid warfare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Putin has endowed him with special emergency powers and, in return, demanded "one to ensure victory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The definition of [[putins_plans_for_military_victory_and_notions_of_victory | "victory"]] remains an open question, possibly meaning "honorable conditions of peace personally of President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
2.  **Military-Political Strategy:** A key reason was to curb the excessive strengthening of Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin, Putin's protégé, who had created many influential ill-wishers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. With Gerasimov's appointment, Prigozhin's forces are now in subordination to Gerasimov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. While Prigozhin is seen as a reliable and effective tool for President Putin, his efforts to form a military resource base and gain political weight had become "excessive strengthening" in the eyes of parts of the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Upcoming Military Dynamics

Both sides are preparing for offensives in the coming months, with a high probability of a Russian armed forces offensive as reported by Western media and intelligence, and Ukraine also preparing for an offensive as it receives tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This period, starting in spring or late winter, is expected to see "big Saba events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

### Potential Scenarios
*   **Russian Side:** A combination of [[general_gerasimovs_strategy_for_counteroffensives | strategic defense]] against a Ukrainian offensive, followed by a transition to a counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Ukrainian Side:** The opposite approach, allowing Russian troops to go on the offensive, become exhausted, and then launching a counterattack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

The upcoming military events are expected to be "the most significant military battle of the 21st century" and "decisive military events that will predetermine the outcome of the armed confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. The outcome of these [[military_operations_and_strategic_goals | military operations]] will largely determine the fate of associations like the CSTO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

## [[mobilization_and_the_state_of_the_russian_army | Mobilization]] Measures

Despite official refutations from figures like Peskov, who dismiss rumors of mobilization as "sabotage and provocations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, evidence suggests ongoing [[political_address_and_military_mobilization_measures_in_Russia | mobilization measures]]:
*   Cancellation of deferment for fathers of many children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   Raising the upper limit of conscription for military service to 30 years, effective in spring, which is described as a "hidden form of mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   Discussion of increasing military service to two years, likely to be resolved positively by the fall draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

*The Times*, citing MI6, reports that Russia is preparing a second stage of [[mobilization_and_the_state_of_the_russian_army | mobilization]], stretched into several parts, with the first wave potentially mobilizing up to half a million people, and a total of up to 2 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This indicates that [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russia is preparing]] for a prolonged confrontation with Ukraine or "the whole world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

## Economic Implications

The prolonged confrontation raises questions about economic resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Russia's main source of foreign exchange, oil and gas exports, is facing challenges:
*   Russian Urals oil fell below $40 per barrel (specifically $38.7) around 10 days prior to the broadcast, the lowest since summer 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   A price ceiling is being introduced from February 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   Russia could lose $100-180 billion in foreign exchange earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   To compensate, Russia is attempting to increase oil exports, with January exports sharply increasing by one and a half times compared to December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

The budget will face serious problems, and losses are expected to be compensated by cutting social expenses and economic development, prioritizing financing for the armed forces and security agencies (Russian Guard, police, FSB, Federal Protective Service) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. This policy is likened to "guns instead of oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

## Strange Deaths in the Defense Industry

A series of "strange deaths" of individuals involved in the defense industry has drawn attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>:
*   **January 9:** Pavel Kamenev, scientific director of Almaz Antey and developer of "Caliber" missiles, died at 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **December 28:** Vladimir Nesterov, general director of the Khrunichev center who led the project for heavy missiles, died at 73 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **December 24:** Alexander Buzakov, general director of the Admiralty shipyards and manufacturer of "Caliber" missiles, died in his 66th year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

The speaker notes that these three deaths do not "look like a coincidence," similar to "suicides or strange deaths of SL employees last year," which are usually hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

## Other Observations
*   **Kremlin Humor:** A popular joke circulating in the Kremlin asked who would die faster: Nikita Mikhalkov or the CSTO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. The CSTO is seen as "breathing on lat" (near death), particularly after Armenian leader Pashinyan's statement that Russia is not a defense threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **[[discussion_on_putins_decisionmaking_and_the_role_of_analysts | Putin's Double]]:** There are rumors that the [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Russian president's]] alleged trip to Ufa for the funeral of Murtaza Rakhimov was actually attended by one of his doubles, specifically his "first main double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. This is compared to Akira Kurosawa's film *Kagemusha* (Shadow of the Warrior), where a double replaces a killed prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

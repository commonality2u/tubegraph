From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The role of [[Occultism and magical practices in Russia | occultism and magical practices in Russia]] and esotericism within the Kremlin is a recurring topic of discussion, often framed as a "black mass" or "occult" phenomenon. This interest is described as escalating, particularly in connection with the perceived health and longevity of Vladimir Putin, the "demiurge" of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Putin's Alleged Personal Engagement

The current focus on [[Occult practices in Russian politics | occult practices in Russian politics]] and esotericism within the [[Kremlin internal political dynamics | Kremlin internal political dynamics]] is directly linked to concerns about Putin's health and desire to prolong his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

### Pyramid Construction
A notable instance of this trend is the construction of pyramids across Russia. One such pyramid near Tomsk was reportedly built by businessmen connected to Yevgeny Prigozhin, with an architect named Valery Uvarov, who had previously designed a spa linked to Prigozhin's spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. These pyramids are seen as part of the [[Occult practices in Russian politics | occult hobbies of the Russian elite]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The location near Tomsk for one pyramid is thought to be significant due to an archaeological discovery in the late 1980s. This expedition uncovered Bronze Age graves containing inventory items related to ancient Egyptian culture, likely due to historical trade routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

The purpose of these modern pyramids is interpreted in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>:
*   **Tombs:** If aligned with the ancient Egyptian pharaohs' use, they could be intended as tombs for powerful individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Mystical Power:** Based on Russian "black ideas" about pyramids, they are believed to be endowed with mystical power. A suggested hierarchy for this power includes a political subject at the top, "shamans" (former Communist Party workers) in the middle, and folk healers like Malakhov at the bottom, aiming to prolong life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Non-Christian Rites and Fortune Tellers
In April, Putin allegedly performed "very strange non-Christian rites" with an elder known by the pseudonym Nikifor. These rituals, conducted for Putin's health and protection, and to "induce damage" and "evil oil" on his enemies, are considered to have no connection to Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

Early in his leadership, Putin reportedly consulted three fortune tellers to learn his future. These anonymous fortune tellers, at least two of whom were outside Russia, all gave "almost identical predictions." The essence of these predictions was that he would rule for 20 years as a "king," but his reign would end "terrible" if he could not "change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Key details like "Georgia, Ukraine, and some characters" were allegedly readable from these allegorical predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Notably, all three predictions were delivered without the final paragraph, which contained ominous phrases such as "all twelve turn away from you" and "be afraid of part of the southern ruler of poisons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. The interpretation of "southern rulers" included Milosevic, Mubarak, and Gaddafi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. The importance of these predictions lies in how they are perceived and acted upon by those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

## Elite Adoption of Mystical Practices

The increasing focus on [[Occultism and magical practices in Russia | occultism and magical practices in Russia]] and esotericism among the Russian elite is attributed to the cyclical end of a 20-year period of rule predicted for Putin, combined with his "fading age" and a perceived loss of "luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. This sense of declining fortune, particularly noticeable since August 2020 with events like the Belarusian revolution and Russia's diminishing influence in the South Caucasus, has led to "extreme nervousness" and "semi-panic" among the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. They had an "almost mystical belief in Putin's luck," which has now disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

### The Santa Muerte Cult
A specific example of [[Occult rites and political synchronization in Russia | occult rites and political synchronization in Russia]] within the elite is the interest in the Santa Muerte cult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. This Mexican syncretic cult combines elements of Christianity with traditional Mexican beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

There are three varieties of the cult, each associated with different goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>:
*   **Black Death:** For career growth and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.
*   **Golden Death:** For wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>.
*   **White Death:** For worldly goods like love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

The altar of Santa Muerte requires a skeleton or skull, ideally from a "powerful person" like a general, as a fool's remains would yield foolish results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>. Graves in Central and South America have been extensively plundered for these purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>. The demand for such relics is high, with wealthy Russians reportedly paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

### The Role of the [[Role of the Russian Orthodox Church in Russian politics | Russian Orthodox Church (ROC)]] and Relics
Putin is not perceived as a "religious person in its classical understanding" but uses visits to the ROC as "protocol events" for spiritual bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:35">[00:22:35]</a>. The elite largely shares this view, perceiving religion as a trend to follow, not necessarily a matter of faith, but a source of "miracle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. For them, Christianity is seen as a "religion of the flesh" rather than the spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>.

As a former KGB officer, Putin is said to know the ROC system from the inside, holding no "special illusions" about it but not rejecting its "main attributes of the miracle," particularly the power of human remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. The "mercilessly exploited" remains have a high demand among those seeking miracles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

However, the Old Testament explicitly forbids touching the dead, stating that a person who does so is "unclean" (Numbers 19:6) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. There are also examples of relic deception, such as two heads of John Chrysostom or the re-doomed relics of Saint Alexander of Svir, which were a mummified, circumcised corpse, despite the saint dying 500 years prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. The trade in such remains involves sophisticated individuals with scientific degrees, not just "diggers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

### Sirius Cult and Alien Encounters
Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, a billionaire and former head of Kalmykia, famously claimed to have visited an "interplanetary ship with aliens" in September 1997 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. He described communicating with them "at the level of thoughts" and being given a tour of their ship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. He stated that three witnesses, his driver, minister, and assistant, confirmed his absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>. This "cult of Sirius" is believed to involve "psychotropic drugs" and is used by other Russian elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. This behavior is seen as typical, with individuals striving to imitate Putin, who is considered the "first overlord" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.

### Prevalence of Mystical Moods
The prevalence of mystical, quasi-esoteric, and pseudo-occult moods in Russia is described as "much worse" than during the end of the Russian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. It is rare to find a group within the establishment unaffected by these moods, though each group has its own "fashion" or "passion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. Trends have included searching for Shambhala, consulting Orthodox elders, then shamans from various regions, and now even shamans in "the zone itself" (likely referring to the prison system) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. A sharp demand for esotericism and occultism has grown since 2014-2015, with Putin himself setting the "fashion" for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>.

Moscow currently has fashionable shamans, fortune tellers (especially those using tarot cards), and astrologers, with long queues for their services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>. This abundance has led to a market where charlatans and their suppliers thrive, often involving the import of "magicians" from places like the Amazon delta, who are sometimes given "specific amplifiers" (drugs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>. Intermediaries for these services receive hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars, and they often prepare magicians to tell clients what they "would be important for the client to hear," confirming existing biases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.

## Reasons and Impact

The elite's turn to magical instruments is driven by their inability to change reality through traditional political and economic means. They feel reality resisting their instruments, with the exception of repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:46">[00:42:46]</a>.

### Belief in Secret Powers
A significant portion of the population, including many [[Role and influence of Russian security services | FSB officers]] and financial figures, believes in a "world government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13">[00:43:13]</a>. They cannot believe in the "chaos" of the world and seek a "secret chancery" or competing chanceries that rule it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. This worldview, described as aligning with Pelevin's novels, leads them to seek "this ring of omnipotence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.

This leads to political competition manifesting as rival groups turning to various magical or pseudo-occult resources. One group might turn to shamans, another to an Orthodox elder (possibly quasi-Orthodox), and yet another to a "magician" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. While these practices may offer a temporary "placebo effect," the long-term outcome is often worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:21">[00:45:21]</a>. Skepticism towards these beliefs is seen as "unfashionable" and a "loss" within these circles, fostering a form of "group identity" or "team building" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:40">[00:45:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.

### The 13 Great World Occult Orders
It is asserted that Russia has no significant contact with the "13 great world occult orders" due to "insurmountable contradictions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. A conflict reportedly arose from "unsuccessful joke" or "human words" that insulted the "great master" of these orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.

One ritual initiated by these 13 orders on June 21st (summer solstice) in the Ligandov Gorge in Nepal, conducted by "authentic shamans," is cited as a reason for significant changes that occurred in Russia after that date, including a perceived disappearance of Russia's "luck" and "militaristic rhetoric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:12">[00:53:12]</a>.

These orders are not merely metaphysical entities but have four components: political, economic, scientific research, and metaphysical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. The conflict with Russia is primarily political <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>. Their core principles are freedom, enlightenment, and uncensored knowledge, which are "completely rejected by the Russian establishment" and government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.

These "non-public organizations" are said to have adherents and supporters within the Russian government and Western governments, influencing politics and foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. They allegedly delivered "sensitive slaps on the nose" to the Russian government, influencing Western media and leaders' tough tones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>. They are described as "political subjects" who do not consider themselves puppeteers but respect "free will," believing people must make conscious choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

## Current Landscape: A "New Middle Ages"
The current era in Russia is characterized as a "new Middle Ages," where people are poisoned, the government engages in "dense black magic rituals," and worships "remains of the dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. This is seen as a period of turbulence, creating a great demand for "a miracle" among the Russian establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. The elite feels a "deep nothing" and uncertainty about where threats will come from, likening Russia to a "cemetery where twilight thickens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:23">[01:00:23]</a>. The 20 years of "wasted" time have accumulated "a lot of hatred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.

The current [[political_and_economic_conditions_in_russia | political and economic conditions in Russia]] are a significant topic of discussion, with the general [[russian_economic_and_financial_outlook | economic prospects of Russia]] described as "joyless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Public interest in Russia primarily revolves around questions of survival, the general [[economic_challenges_and_financial_management_in_russia | economic prospects]], the future of Russia, and the global context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Official Statements vs. Reality

President Vladimir Putin has noted "positive dynamics" in reducing the poverty level in Russia, stating that by the end of the third quarter, the poverty level dropped to 10.5 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. However, this figure still means that every tenth citizen of Russia is living in poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The speaker argues that this represents "hellish poverty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, and even those considered middle class are, by decent standards, not rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

> [!INFO] Perception of Poverty
> Only 23 percent of Russians are satisfied with their financial situation, according to public opinion polls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This suggests that the public's perception of their financial well-being differs significantly from the president's statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Further indicators of the dire financial situation include the fact that 43 percent of Russians who have microcredit loans have an overdue payment of more than three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This figure represents over 90 days overdue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The speaker suggests that the Russian government and elite live on "another planet" and are disconnected from the reality of the people's lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

## [[Russian economic crisis and forecasts | Economic Forecasts]] and Oil Price Cap

Emily Blanchard, the chief economist of the U.S. State Department, forecasts that the [[russian_economy_and_financial_forecasts | Russian economy]] is expected to fall by at least 20 percent over the next 8-10 years, representing a loss of a fifth of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. The American conclusion is that the Russian economy will be "stable in its decline and degradation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

The introduction of a ceiling on oil prices is a significant economic event, with consequences expected to be seen by January or February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. The set price cap of $60 per barrel by Canada, Australia, the EU, and the G7 countries is considered "comfortable for Russia," as Russian oil was already selling at $52 per barrel (with discounts) in the last week of November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

However, Russia's leadership has stated that it will not supply oil to countries that have adopted these restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This decision could impact 47 percent of all oil exports that go to EU countries, with the exception of Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. There is speculation that oil will still reach Europe through third countries via transshipment in the open sea, delivered under a foreign flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Russia has reportedly bought 100 tankers in the last month, ostensibly for deliveries to China, India, and Asian countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Sanctions Evasion and Consequences
> The European Union is introducing a law with a five-year prison term for those who help Russia circumvent sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, indicating anticipation of such evasion.

The decision of OPEC regarding oil production will also influence prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. If OPEC increases production due to U.S. pressure, raw material prices will not rise, potentially mitigating Russia's ability to compensate for losses by increasing oil costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## Budget and Inflation

The Russian budget is expected to suffer losses, which will be reflected in the reserve fund not being replenished as much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The budget rules will likely not be implemented at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Due to a decrease in foreign exchange earnings, the "printing press will be spun up," leading to accelerated inflation in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

## Public Sentiment and Future Prospects

Public opinion, particularly from closed surveys by the Federal Security Service (FSO), indicates a significant shift. 55 percent of Russians are now in favor of peace negotiations with Ukraine, while only 25 percent support continuing the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. This data aligns with findings from the Levada Center, an independent sociological center, which reported 57 percent for peace negotiations and 27 percent for continued military action in October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

This change in public perception is attributed to three main reasons:
1.  **Reliable Information:** More accurate information about what is happening is becoming available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
2.  **Partial Mobilization:** The stage of partial mobilization significantly impacted people's attitudes, bringing the conflict closer to home and demonstrating its personal consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.
3.  **Upcoming Mobilization:** Fears are growing about a potential second stage of mobilization, which is expected to be "incomparably more extensive" than the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. This is seen as the political leadership's only way to counter Ukrainian pressure, by "throwing bodies" to halt the offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

The year 2022 has been described as the "hardest year in Russia in the last 20 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. The forecast for 2023 is that it will unfortunately "seem even harder than the outgoing one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. These [[economic_challenges_and_political_crisis_developments_in_russia | economic challenges]] and the growing public apprehension indicate a difficult period ahead for Russia.

Valery Solovey's program, "What Happens," reflected on 2022 and offered a gloomy outlook for 2023, suggesting that the phrase "Today we are alive, and this is our happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> might become the motto for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. He noted that President Putin's address promised "severe trials" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> and predicted 2023 would be a "year of military action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Impending Mobilization Measures

A new bill, already in its third reading in the State Duma on the eve of the New Year, legally allows mobilization summonses to be served by registered mail with notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. If a citizen receives a notice for a registered letter from the post office and goes to retrieve it, the summons is considered handed over upon signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Even if the letter is taken but not opened, or if it's refused at the post office, the postman's note that the recipient was present means the summons is still considered handed over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Solovey advises that receiving such a notice means it's not a "letter of happiness" but a call to "fulfill your patriotic duty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Seven Lessons from 2022

Solovey shared personal lessons from 2022, which he believes hold public interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. These "sad thoughts" about what is happening and what might happen also contain "sprouts of some hope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, serving as "Optics" to examine the future of [[sociocultural_and_political_changes_in_postputin_russia | Russia]] in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Lesson 1: Misunderstanding Russian Society

According to Solovey, a key lesson is that "we do not know the [[social_and_economic_issues_in_modern_russia | Society]] in which we live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Many Russians have been repeatedly surprised by the behavior of their compatriots over the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, indicating a lack of understanding of [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This misunderstanding stems from two fundamental factors:

*   **Data Inaccuracy and Falsification:** Sociological and statistical data in [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russia]] is often inaccurate or openly falsified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This falsification is so deeply ingrained that it creates problems even for the authorities themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. As an example, in 2019, the supreme leadership could not obtain accurate data on voting for the ruling party because the system of falsification was too "ramified, multi-level, and ingrained" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Weakness:** Solovey admits that the intellectual class often exhibits an "intellectual weakness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. They are frequently unable to understand or draw conclusions from what is "literally before our eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. He compares this to Solzhenitsyn's "communism in plain sight," noting that the "Putin system" has "always been in plain sight before us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, yet many failed or refused to understand it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

### Lesson 2: Defects in Domestic Mentality

The intellectual weakness observed is linked to two defects in the "domestic mentality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>:

*   **Poor Knowledge of Domestic History:** A weak understanding of [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian history]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a> hinders the use of historical analogies, which are more accurate for forecasting during crises than simple extrapolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Historical analogies help understand that events can radically change the course of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, and similar situations may recur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Weak Imagination:** Despite common belief, imagination is crucial for serious analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. It allows for the contemplation of "things that have previously been unimaginable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Solovey suggests that the "political class" is unable to imagine "another [[sociocultural_and_political_changes_in_postputin_russia | Russia]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>, and [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russian intellectuals]] also lack imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. This deficiency leads to limitations in knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. He cites Saxo Bank's "outrageous forecasts" as examples of how expanding intellectual frameworks provides flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, much like the historical role of "Devil's Advocates" in questioning assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

An example of this lack of imagination is the ruling class's inability to comprehend the "true nature of [[political_dynamics_and_elite_struggles_in_russia | Russian power]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Solovey references former President Dmitry Medvedev's repeated flights to Kathmandu, Nepal, not for mountaineering, but because one of his advisors believes the region holds an entrance to the mythical Shambhala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. This behavior, including spending "tens of millions of dollars" on such searches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>, highlights a peculiar aspect of the elite's mindset.

### Lesson 3: Adaptability and Plasticity of Society

[[Current_state_of_political_and_social_issues_in_russia | Russian society]] is described as "very flexible and highly adaptive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. This is both a strength, allowing society to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, and a weakness, as it quickly habituates to "the bad," begins to "endure the unbearable," and even "settle in this unbearable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

### Lesson 4: Moralism and Lack of Distinction Between Good and Evil

The flip side of this plasticity is the "moralism" of [[societal_changes_in_russia | Russian society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, meaning a state "Beyond good and evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. While Russians are "very capable people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>, they are "capable of literally everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. A significant portion of the population struggles to distinguish between good and evil, being "amoral" rather than inherently bad or evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Consequently, they can be led "with equal success" to both negative and positive paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. Currently, a "significant part of society" passively and fatalistically follows the given path "without any internal resistance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

### Lesson 5: Contradictory Mental State of Society

The [[the_psychology_and_consequences_of_consensus_and_dissent_in_russian_society | mental state of Russian society]] is highly contradictory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. On one hand, there is "deep depression and apathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, and on the other, "agitation and high readiness for aggression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. These "swings" could rapidly intensify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. Despite this, there is a deep societal need to "return to normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, recognizing the current state as "deeply abnormal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Once negative emotions and aggression are "splashed out" globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>, society could move in a "directly opposite" direction if guided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, echoing the Chinese phrase: "people grass, rulers wind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

### Lesson 6: Resilience and Growth Potential of the Economy

The [[social_and_economic_issues_in_modern_russia | Russian economy]] has shown "very stable" performance over the past year, enduring degradation while holding up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. This resilience suggests that the economy is capable of rapid "restorative growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>, which could even transition into long-term growth due to the adaptability of the people and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. Solovey believes the Russian economy "will not collapse" due to mistakes, crimes, or sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a> and can recover and develop quickly if left unhindered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

### Lesson 7: Competent Bureaucracy Serving Evil

The final lesson highlights that "final stability" in [[internal_political_dynamics_and_challenges_in_russia | Russia]] was ensured last year through the "competent efforts by senior government officials, bureaucrats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. While the existence of such qualified personnel is good news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>, the "bad news is that these people serve evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. This serves as further proof of the societal "moralism" where officials, like the average Russian, exhibit high conformism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>. However, Solovey notes these individuals could potentially "begin to serve a good cause" or "go over to the right side of history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

Regarding the financial system, Solovey contrasts two economist forecasts: one predicting stability due to competent bureaucrats, and another forecasting inevitable ruble bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:27">[00:22:27]</a>. He concludes that the outcome depends on "political factors" interfering with economic and financial processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>, and these factors are more likely to be destructive in 2023 than in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

Solovey concludes by urging self-care, as 2023 will likely demand it as an "imperative of our life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. He anticipates 2023 will be the year when [[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | Russia]] can "change our destiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>, emphasizing the need to "know the main thing firmly, do not doubt: victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.

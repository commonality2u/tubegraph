## Anticipated Political and Governance Shifts

### Ministry of Defense Purge
The detention of Timur Ivanov and the anticipated removal of other deputy defense and internal affairs ministers are part of a broader plan to update the defense department and increase its efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. This initiative aims to punish those responsible for failures, mistakes, and abuses within the department <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. The speaker had predicted these removals before the New Year and in February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### Sergei Shoigu's Fate
It was predicted on February 15 that Sergei Shoigu should be removed from his post as Minister of Defense and instead become the head of the Russian Guard, replacing General Zolotov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This move is described as a "show resignation" but also a "mockery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. Nikolai Patrushev, among others, is said to have changed his opinion regarding Shoigu, who is now reportedly not opposed to leaving his current position despite an upcoming purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

### Kadyrov's Health and Chechnya's Status
Ramzan Kadyrov is indeed seriously ill, though his illness is not considered fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. The question of his succession is not a practical issue currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. It is not true that Kadyrov wants to be appointed Minister of Internal Affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. In the event of a [[future_leadership_and_governance_in_russia | change in Russia's leadership]], a conflict with Chechnya is deemed extremely unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. The relationship between Chechnya and the new authorities is expected to develop differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

The SVR General's team, if it comes to power, plans to allow Chechnya to become "free floating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. This option is preferable if the choice is between war and free floating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. For Dagestan, the primary concern is the quality of management, not the ethnicity of the manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

### Political Crisis and Change of Power
An acute political crisis is highly probable this fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>, marking a "fatal fork" in Russia's path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. The speaker predicts a "complete, final break with the previous legitimacy," which will be a revolution in legal terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:36:00">[15:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:38:00">[15:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>. A new Russian Republic will be established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>.

The crisis is expected to involve the use of armed force at its peak, lasting only a few days when the issue of power is decided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:56:00">[39:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:01:00">[40:01:00]</a>. Overall, the crisis will extend for several months, characterized by disorganization of public life and weakening of state and municipal government functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:04:00">[40:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:08:00">[40:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>. This means possible, but temporary, interruptions in electricity, gas, and water supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:16:00">[40:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:26:00">[40:26:00]</a>. The crisis is fundamentally the disintegration of the existing state fabric and the creation of a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:36:00">[40:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:41:00">[40:41:00]</a>.

### Economic and Social Reforms
The new authorities do not plan to nationalize all private companies, especially small and medium businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:49:00">[40:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:55:00">[40:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:57:00">[40:57:00]</a>. They intend to preserve small and medium businesses, while large businesses and parts of medium-sized "strategic industries" will be transferred to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:05:00">[41:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:07:00">[41:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:10:00">[41:10:00]</a>.

The funded part of pensions will be returned as part of a new pension program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>. Indigenous people of Russia are expected to receive interest from the sale of minerals, similar to the UAE, within their lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:42:00">[16:42:00]</a>. This will serve as a reserve fund, emphasizing the people's health, well-being, and future as the best reserve for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:50:00">[16:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:00">[16:53:00]</a>.

The speaker's team believes it can significantly increase pensions within a year after a change of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>.

### Treatment of Officials and Security Forces
Upon coming to power, the new team does not plan to retrain officials and security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:38:00">[24:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:00">[24:40:00]</a>. Instead, those who fall under "chandelier law enforcement" will not be able to work in the security sphere, and officials who "set fire to the SRA" will not be able to work in civil or municipal administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:58:00">[24:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:00:00">[25:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:03:00">[25:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08:00">[25:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:11:00">[25:11:00]</a>. Otherwise, other spheres will be open to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:13:00">[25:13:00]</a>.

## Geopolitical Strategies and Foreign Relations

### Ukraine Conflict Resolution
There are very serious reasons to believe that by the end of this year, Russia will reach either a peace treaty or peace negotiations leading to a truce with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:29:00">[31:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:31:00">[31:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:35:00">[31:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:38:00">[31:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:42:00">[31:42:00]</a>.

### Restoration of Relations with the West
The fundamental condition for restoring relations with the West is a peace treaty or a truce with Ukraine that generally meets both Ukrainian and Western expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:33:00">[29:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:35:00">[29:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:41:00">[29:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:46:00">[29:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:48:00">[29:48:00]</a>. If this precondition is met, relations with the West could be restored fairly quickly, possibly within 2-3 years, almost to their full extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:01:00">[30:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:07:00">[30:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:12:00">[30:12:00]</a>.

### Geopolitical Influence
Currently, Russia's geopolitical influence in Europe and Central Asia is not very significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19:00">[30:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:23:00">[30:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:26:00">[30:26:00]</a>. However, once a new government is in place and the conditions for improved relations are met, Russia is expected to intensively build a new paradigm of relations with the world and within itself, leading to restored relations with Europe and Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:28:00">[30:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:35:00">[30:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:37:00">[30:37:00]</a>.

### Operation Against Baltic Countries
An operation by the Russian Federation against the Baltic countries is tentatively scheduled for the turn of summer or fall this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:54:00">[27:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:55:00">[27:55:00]</a>. The operation is expected to be brief, lasting only a couple of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:38:00">[27:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:40:00">[27:40:00]</a>. The public will be informed when the preparatory stage begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:58:00">[27:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:01:00">[28:01:00]</a>.

### Putin's Doubles and Legitimacy
The speaker asserts that all legislative acts and regulatory documents signed by a "double" of Putin will be legally null and void, undermining the legitimacy of power irrevocably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:00">[15:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>. The speaker relies on personal observation, expert phonoscopic examination, and reliable sources that have never failed him to support claims of Putin's doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:07:00">[24:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:00">[24:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:00">[24:22:00]</a>.

## Other Relevant Information
*   **Lavrov's Activity**: Sergey Lavrov has become very active because Nikolai Patrushev was very unhappy with him, and Lavrov is trying to stay alive and in his position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:52:00">[28:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:59:00">[28:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:01:00">[29:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:04:00">[29:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:08:00">[29:08:00]</a>.
*   **Putin's Death**: The speaker implies Putin is dead by referring to the ongoing use of doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:22:00">[23:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:33:00">[23:33:00]</a>.
*   **Patrushev and Chemezov**: The speaker acknowledges the classification that Patrushev reflects the interests of security forces and Chemezov reflects businessmen, noting that some security forces are guided by Chemezov and some businessmen by Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>. Financial authorities and the financial block of the government are guided by Chemezov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:00">[15:04:00]</a>.
*   **World Government**: The speaker states that a "world government" does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:43:00">[32:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:48:00">[32:48:00]</a>. However, there are non-public organizations (fewer than a dozen and a half) that exert very significant influence on the global economy and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:00">[32:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:58:00">[32:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:00">[33:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:04:00">[33:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:07:00">[33:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:09:00">[33:09:00]</a>. These organizations influence through people they bring into government, top managers, corporation owners, intellectual trusts, and advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:21:00">[33:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:24:00">[33:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:28:00">[33:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:30:00">[33:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:33:00">[33:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:36:00">[33:36:00]</a>. They generally operate in a state of "positive neutrality," supporting each other and playing a positive role in maintaining world balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:47:00">[33:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:50:00">[33:50:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:52:00">[33:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:54:00">[33:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:11:00">[34:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:15:00">[34:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:17:00">[34:17:00]</a>.
*   **Industrial Revolution Center Memorandum**: The speaker dismisses the notion that the memorandum signed in October 2021 for the creation of an Industrial Revolution center in Russia is being implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:53:00">[36:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:56:00">[36:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:59:00">[36:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:01:00">[37:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:03:00">[37:03:00]</a>. This type of "mythology" is supported by the presidential administration to distract people from pressing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:23:00">[37:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:25:00">[37:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:28:00">[37:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:30:00">[37:30:00]</a>.
*   **Prigozhin's Return**: The speaker states that Prigozhin will return and seek revenge, having someone to take revenge for and something to take revenge for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:04:00">[38:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:07:00">[38:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:09:00">[38:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:13:00">[38:13:00]</a>. Those close to him are awaiting his return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:16:00">[38:16:00]</a>.
*   **Foreign Agent Law**: The law on "foreign agents" in the Russian Federation is described as "completely idiotic," as it now deems foreign influence (e.g., giving an interview to any foreign media) sufficient grounds for recognition as a foreign agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:51:00">[42:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:54:00">[42:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:57:00">[42:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:58:00">[42:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:01:00">[43:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:03:00">[43:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:05:00">[43:05:00]</a>.
*   **Medvedev**: Dmitry Medvedev is characterized as having the "psychotype of an alcoholic raging at the counters," whose pronouncements are no longer listened to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:51:00">[43:51:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:53:00">[43:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:57:00">[43:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:00:00">[44:00:00]</a>.

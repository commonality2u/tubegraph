Valery Solovey discusses the anticipated [[economic_and_political_situation_in_russia | economic and political climate in Russia]] following potential political transitions, particularly the death of President Putin. He projects significant societal shifts and economic impacts that will accompany these changes.

## Current Economic Situation
Signs of an [[economic_challenges_in_russia | economic crisis]] are already observable in Russia, including the devaluation of the ruble, inflation, and a general sense of [[economic_and_social_consequences_in_russia | economic instability]] where the "ground is slipping from under our feet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. While unemployment may appear to be declining, the underlying instability is palpable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Financial Misappropriation
A staggering amount of profit, estimated at 4 trillion US dollars, has been withdrawn from Russia, stemming from the sale of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. This sum, Solovey states, could have transformed the country into "a semblance of an earthly Paradise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, comparable to the United Arab Emirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Post-Putin Economic Outlook
After the physical death of the current leader, a period of short-term stability is expected, followed by a likely plunge into chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This [[economic_and_political_challenges_in_russia | chaos]] is hoped to be short-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. A large-scale economic crisis is anticipated to be synchronous with the [[political_crisis_and_economic_implications_in_russia | political transition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

Solovey predicts that the "scale of changes and the consequences of changes will far exceed the 1990s" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>, indicating a period of profound disruption and restructuring.

## Opportunity for Change
Despite the impending [[economic_and_social_consequences_in_russia | crisis]], Solovey views the period after Putin's departure as an opportunity for Russia to embark on a "correct, free, competitive, and competitive development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. He emphasizes the necessity of competition, drawing a contrast with the lack of it during the past 20 years and over 70 years of Soviet power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

### Federalism and Budgetary Independence
A key step towards a new Russia will be the transformation of the country from a nominal federation into an actual one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. This will begin with granting budgetary independence to the regions of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

## International Perspectives on Russian Stability
Both Western countries and China are prepared to deal with a "double" or new dictator, as their primary interest lies in preserving the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.
*   **China's interest** is to maintain Russia's economic dependence, ensuring Russia continues to provide raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.
*   **The West's interest** is to maintain political stability in Russia, ensuring control over the nuclear arsenal. Any figure that provides this stability, even a dictator, would be acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

Solovey characterizes this international policy as "absolutely hypocritical and two-faced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>, as it prioritizes external interests over the freedom and economic well-being of the Russian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

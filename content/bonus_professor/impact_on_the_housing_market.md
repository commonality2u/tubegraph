The housing market, particularly the construction industry, is considered a key indicator of economic health, with demand for housing typically signifying a developing economy [01:21:21]. However, in Russia, the situation within the housing market and among Russian developers is described as "pre-catastrophic" and rapidly moving towards a full catastrophe [01:18:29].

## Current Situation

The construction industry currently leads all other industries in the rate of debt growth [01:54:54]. This is primarily due to the significant increase in the Central Bank's key rate [02:01:01].

### Key Rate Increases
*   The Central Bank's key rate is projected to increase by two points this month, rising from 21% to 23% [02:06:06].
*   At the beginning of the next year, it is expected to jump by 10-12 points, with a target indicator of 35% [02:10:10].

These rate hikes make it difficult for construction companies to repay loans [02:29:29]. Simultaneously, they are struggling to sell newly built housing, with approximately 60% of apartments in new buildings remaining unsold [02:34:34].

## Looming Collapse
The combination of debt growth and unsold inventory points to an "inevitable" pessimistic scenario of the construction market's collapse, leading to bankruptcies [02:43:43].

*   Small and medium-sized construction companies are most likely to face bankruptcy [02:49:49].
*   Larger companies may survive through loans and workforce reductions [02:51:51]. For example, Pika, a major Moscow developer, is mentioned in this context [02:59:59].
*   The owner of a 36% share in "Airplane," another major Moscow developer, is reportedly trying to urgently sell their stake, ironically implying a lack of profitability [03:06:06].

This collapse will have widespread implications for all related industries and their workers [03:29:29]. It will also severely affect individuals who purchased apartments at the excavation stage or who have already invested in unfinished buildings, with a real prospect of delays or non-completion [03:39:39]. Stories of unfortunate developers and buyers trying to seek justice for years, or even decades, are a potential future [03:52:52].

### Housing Prices
Initially, housing prices might decrease as developers attempt to offload unsold properties [04:09:09]. However, due to significant inflation, prices are expected to rise later [04:17:17].

*   For 2022, unofficial inflation data suggest prices have almost doubled (a 90% increase), compared to the official 30% [04:24:24].
*   Forecasts for the next year predict an inflation growth of 100% to 200% [04:46:46].
*   The speaker notes that if people think current exchange rates (e.g., 108 rubles per dollar or 115-116 per euro) are too high for buying currency, they will see much higher costs in a few months [04:59:59].

This article, based on a Q&A session with Valery Solovey, discusses various aspects of [[International relations and diplomatic challenges for Russia|Russia's international relations]] and the roles of key Russian figures within that context.

## Kremlin's International Stance and Perceptions

The speaker asserts that the Kremlin contributed to escalating the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, despite not providing detailed commentary on the region's specifics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. He also notes that the recent events in Israel do not threaten a third world war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.

Regarding the international community's approach to Russia, it is stated that the West and China are aware that Vladimir Putin is being replaced by a double and are prepared to engage with this double on visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. The primary concern for these global powers is to maintain the status quo, rather than focusing on the freedom or economic well-being of the Russian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

China's interest lies in preserving [[Russias international relations and sanctions|Russia's economic dependence]], ensuring a continued supply of raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. For the West, the priority is [[Western influence and geopolitics involving Russia|political stability in Russia]], particularly the control over its nuclear arsenal. As long as this stability is maintained, even under a dictatorship, any figure will be acceptable to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. This approach is described as hypocritical and two-faced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

The speaker dismisses the notion of a "global agenda" imposed by figures like Klaus Schwab, stating that no world government possesses the power to force states to follow such an agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Involvement of Key Russian Figures

### Yevgeny Prigozhin
[[Role and influence of key Russian political figures and coalitions|Yevgeny Prigozhin]] is reportedly alive, at large, and located in Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The FBI's arrest order for him has not been cancelled, and intelligence agencies are aware he is alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Prigozhin intends to reappear soon after Putin's death and disclose significant information, including details about the Russian president's doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. It is expected that he will likely become part of a broader alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Roman Abramovich
[[Russian elites and their interaction with Western organizations|Roman Abramovich]] is actively involved as a mediator in negotiations between conflicting parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. He is linked to [[Role and influence of key Russian political figures and coalitions|Sergei Chemezov]], the head of Rostekhnologii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. However, Abramovich's mediation efforts are considered unacceptable by a significant portion of the Russian elite, particularly those currently holding the most power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

### Putin's Family and Other Elite Figures
The positions of [[Role and influence of key Russian political figures and coalitions|Putin's family]] are weakening, and a family member intends to leave Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

After Putin's death, nothing good is expected for [[Role and influence of key Russian political figures and coalitions|Shoigu]] and [[Role and influence of key Russian political figures and coalitions|Peskov]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. Shoigu is noted to have no influence within the armed forces and will be unable to play an independent role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

The idea of a "[[Role and influence of key Russian political figures and coalitions|Kiriyenko group]]" seizing power is dismissed, as such a group reportedly does not exist. While [[Role and influence of key Russian political figures and coalitions|Sergey Kiriyenko]] is acknowledged as a brilliant technologist and skilled administrator, his group lacks influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

[[Role and influence of key Russian political figures and coalitions|Surkov]] is stated to have no positions of influence and has not been a decision-maker for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.

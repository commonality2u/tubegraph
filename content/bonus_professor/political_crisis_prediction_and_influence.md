From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 
Valery announced the first episode of the program "Answers to Hot Questions," scheduled for Thursday, May 9 at 1:00 PM Moscow time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Correction to Previous Information
Valery issued a correction regarding a statement made in his May 6 video, where he erroneously reported that Tartu airport was closed for a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The idea of closing Tartu airport was discussed but not implemented, as threats to flight safety were neutralized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. He apologized for unintentionally misleading viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### [[prospects_of_political_crisis_and_potential_changes_in_russian_governance | Political Crisis Prediction and Influence]]
It is impossible to predict the full development, content, and results of a political crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. No existing theories allow for such predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. However, predicting the *beginning* or entry into a political crisis is possible, with an accuracy exceeding 75%, approaching that of a short-term weather forecast (85%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

If actively participating in the crisis from its inception, there are tangible chances to influence desirable outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The most acute phase of the crisis, its peak, is expected to last only a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, while the crisis itself will extend for several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

#### [[political_dynamics_and_elite_struggles_in_russia | Elite Struggles and Power Dynamics]]
*   **Patrushev's Position**: Those opposing Nikolai Platonovich Patrushev and his allies are equally influential, making it difficult to resist them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. In power struggles, absolute loyalty of friends and allies is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Patrushev's stubbornness may be due to the "rate of power" in Russia, which blinds rational and logical sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Succession and Crisis**: If someone other than Patrushev's son is chosen, it would not signal Patrushev's loss or the absence of a crisis; instead, it would strengthen and deepen the crisis, which Nikolai Platonovich would not accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   **Coalition Strengths**: The impression that "Patrushev's tower" holds absolute power is erroneous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The strength of competing coalitions, such as Patrushev's and Chemezov's, is currently equal, with Chemezov's potentially even stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Kostin of VTB gravitates towards Chemezov's coalition, as do most business people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Role of State Agencies**:
    *   **Prosecutor General's Office and Investigative Committee**: Expected to side with the winners in the upcoming crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. In the acute phase, they may not play a direct role due to lacking armed resources, but can serve as instruments for one of the coalitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   **Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA)**: Will likely be subordinate to the winning side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The leadership might err, so neutrality (the "fortress plan" â€“ closing stations and defending themselves) is the most preferable position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. This behavior is compared to the KGB of the USSR in August 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
    *   **Ministry of Defense (MoD) and General Staff**: The MoD will likely remain neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. However, within the General Staff and among army personnel, the main department could play an important role when the time comes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

#### [[potential_political_transition_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | Post-Transition Reforms and Social Policies]]
*   **Justice and Accountability**: Individuals who committed crimes, such as beating protestors or issuing illegal sentences, will be prosecuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. All court employees will undergo lustration without exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Confiscating service housing is uncertain, as lustration is considered sufficient punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Pension issues are under discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.
*   **Economic Measures**:
    *   **Minimum Wage**: Plans to increase the minimum wage at least two to three times through internal resource redistribution, and reduction of theft and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
    *   **Housing Prices**: Housing prices and mortgage costs are expected to decrease significantly due to rationalization, increased efficiency, and establishing order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   **Currency**: Advises stocking up on dollars or euros, as the ruble faces unfavorable prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
    *   **Cryptocurrency**: A ban on cryptocurrency and crypto exchanges is not planned due to Russia's need to utilize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
    *   **Financial Crisis Preparedness**: In case of a spontaneous financial crisis, freezing deposits is not excluded; citizens might face limited withdrawals and tightened card limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Retirement Age**: The team plans to return to the previous retirement age values within 1-1.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. Those who retired at the higher age (e.g., 62 or 63) will receive financial compensation paid out in a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Vital drugs will be provided for free or at significant discounts (70-90%) for retirees and those in difficult social circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.
*   **Weapons Legislation**: The regular tightening of weapons legislation reflects the authorities' fear of armed people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>. The speaker believes that the right to bear arms should be introduced in Russia after a period of stabilization post-military actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>.
*   **Data Leaks**: The problem of personal data leaks, often originating from government agencies and protected by officials, can be stopped and the perpetrators punished within 3-6 months with the political will of a new government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.

#### Civil War and Russia's Collapse
The elite war is not expected to escalate into a large-scale civil war or the collapse of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. While armed excesses are probable, they will likely be localized and brief, possibly limited to the center of the Russian capital, or involve only the threat of weapons use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. A risk of a split or withdrawal of some territories exists, particularly in the North Caucasus, which is identified as a dangerous zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.

#### Post-Coup Considerations
*   **Prigozhin's Return**: It is certain that Evgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin will reappear in Russia when he deems the time most favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.
*   **Monarchy**: The speaker personally believes that a monarchy might make sense in the very distant future (15-20 years), not necessarily a Romanov dynasty, but a different, extremely limited monarchy serving as a symbol of unity and guardians of law and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.
*   **Chemezov as President**: Theoretically possible, but Chemezov, like Patrushev Sr., prefers to govern or influence Russia from behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>.

### [[military_events_and_geopolitical_forecasts | Geopolitical and Military Forecasts]]
*   **Kharkov**: The Russian Federation desires to take Kharkov but currently lacks the military strength for such an operation, and it's unlikely such forces will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. However, the Ukrainian front could collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Taking Kharkov is seen as a powerful incentive for Ukraine to negotiate on Russia's terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. The role of chance in military actions is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   **Peaceful Negotiations**: Peaceful negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are possible both before and after a coup in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. The speaker's team actively participates in efforts to stop the conflict, though specific methods are not disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **War Crimes**: The political force represented is definitely positive about investigating and punishing war criminals and those guilty of crimes against humanity after the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Nuclear War**: While theoretically not excluded, the real possibility of a nuclear conflict starting is very small, despite saber-rattling and rhetoric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **Kaliningrad Region**: If Russia does not initiate a hybrid operation against the Baltic countries, Kaliningrad will be fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. If it starts, its fate depends on the operation's dynamics and NATO's reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.
*   **Crimea**: Crimea is not expected to fare well, regardless of how the situation unfolds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.
*   **Siberia and Far East**: A hypothetical possibility exists for these territories to come under China's protectorate, but this possibility is expected to tend to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. Much depends on the future Russian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.
*   **Kremlin's Regional Plans**:
    *   **Georgia**: The Kremlin has largely implemented its plans for Georgia, with the Georgian leadership under strong Kremlin influence, evidenced by the adoption of the "foreign agent" law copied from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. However, the Kremlin cannot influence Georgian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.
    *   **Armenia**: The Kremlin desires to punish Armenia for Nikol Pashinyan's leadership, but its resources are diverted to other fronts, making it unable to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Operation in Baltic States**: A preliminary hybrid operation targeting Latvia and Estonia is scheduled for summer-fall 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. Although the plan is developed and has non-zero chances of success, the preparatory stage has not yet begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. It is advised to follow information from sources like General SVR for updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

### Insights on Information and Public Perception
*   **Navalny's Gelendzhik Palace Film**: The "completion" of the Gelendzhik palace after its initial construction and subsequent demolition (except for the shell) is described as a "gigantic theft of budgets," which is its main purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Who lives there is irrelevant, as it can be demolished again if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   **"New Dolls" Satirical Program**: The revival of the satirical program "Dolls" is seen as a very successful attempt at satirically depicting Russian reality, with approval from the original author Shenderovich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Putin's Status**: The speaker calmly asserts with absolute knowledge and confidence that Putin is not alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>. Other bloggers may not claim this due to lack of confidence, fear, or because it would destroy their established "coordinate system" of fighting against Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>. This is seen as an intellectual fiasco for those who refuse to acknowledge it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.
*   **Peskov's Knowledge**: Peskov, like the entire top Russian elite, knows that Putin is not alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. However, Peskov is not on any team, has insignificant influence, and is of no use to anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:38">[00:32:38]</a>.
*   **Criticism and Envy**: When people criticize without personal knowledge, the problem lies with the critics, not the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Common motives for such criticism include envy and jealousy, or an attempt to create a favorable background for themselves by speaking negatively about others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. Attributing ulterior motives to others (e.g., "it's all for the sake of money") is a projection of their own internal states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. The recommended reaction is ignoring with a sense of self-esteem and superiority, without reciprocating negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.
*   **Agents in Opposition Media**: There are many agents of Russian special services in the opposition media environment whose names would shock the public, and these discoveries are expected soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

### Social and Psychological Aspects
*   **PTSD**: The speaker notes that a significant portion (one-third to one-half) of people involved in military actions experience Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), leading to inadequate and socially dangerous behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. This condition is difficult to treat fundamentally, requiring constant medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>.
*   **Authorities' Disregard**: The current Russian authorities do not care about the population's problems, including PTSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>. They believe they are protected from angry, disoriented people, viewing citizens merely as a "working code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>.

### Speaker's Team Confidence
The speaker's confidence in his team's coming to power is based on two factors: knowledge of the specific societal situation and balance of power (rational part), and "some other things" that give confidence in victory, which cannot be disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>.

### Miscellaneous
*   The death of Stalin is attributed to not being prevented from dying or given timely medical care, as depicted in the film "The Death of Stalin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.
*   The Russian government's potential pandemic agreement with the WHO is deemed irrelevant, as WHO influence is minimal ("a thousand times less than zero") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.
*   The team views Russia's WTO membership very calmly; it neither hinders nor significantly helps, and no country has left the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.
*   The law banning "foreign agents" from participating in elections is viewed with sarcasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.
*   Exercises to close social media like YouTube, Telegram, and WhatsApp were unsuccessful, so no blocking is currently planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.

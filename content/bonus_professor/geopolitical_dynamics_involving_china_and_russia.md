## China's Shifting Stance at the Munich Conference

[[russias_political_and_economic_relations_with_china | China's position]] at the Munich conference was described as "very interesting and ambiguous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics_and_potential_weapon_supply_issues | China is gradually moving towards the Western coalition's stance]], albeit reluctantly and slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

While [[russias_political_and_economic_relations_with_china | China has declared itself categorically against unilateral sanctions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, a position potentially influenced by its own concerns about US sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, [[russias_political_and_economic_relations_with_china | its representative also insisted on peace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### China's Peace Plan

[[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics_and_potential_weapon_supply_issues | China, characterized by President Putin as Russia's "Great Eastern Partner," is prepared to present its "Peace Plan"]], a very interesting formulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This [[russias_political_and_economic_relations_with_china | plan is based on "respect for the sovereignty of both parties"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, which [[russias_political_and_economic_relations_with_china | implies Russia must abandon its territorial claims in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The intention to present this plan soon suggests [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics_and_potential_weapon_supply_issues | China has been developing it for an extended period]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

This development indicates that [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics_and_potential_weapon_supply_issues | China "does not believe in the possibility of Victory of the Russian Federation"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> nor in [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics_and_potential_weapon_supply_issues | "the strategic genius of President Putin"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. A potential meeting between Xi Jinping and Putin was reportedly conditioned on Russia achieving a decisive victory or agreeing to peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, with the former option now considered "crossed out" by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## China's Warning on Nuclear Weapons

Among others, [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics_and_potential_weapon_supply_issues | "Chinese comrades warn" Putin against the use of nuclear weapons]], even at the highest level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. Despite this, there is concern that Putin is psychologically and morally prepared for such a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>, leading to a "colossal" risk that the world has not faced since the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

This article summarizes discussions from the 61st issue of the program "Moscow is with you" with Valery Solovey, recorded on April 16th and released on April 17th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The primary topic of discussion is the [[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization | upcoming mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Current Status of Martial Law

Formally, [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] was introduced in Russia on September 21st, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. However, it currently applies exclusively to the "new territories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## Potential Extension of Martial Law

There is a significant incentive for authorities to extend [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] to most or all of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This potential extension of martial law to the entire territory of the country could be part of the preliminary preparation for the [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Implications of Extended Martial Law

The speaker has previously detailed the "delights" associated with [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Factors Influencing the Decision

The decision to declare [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] is not driven by the will or concern of the president for society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Instead, it depends on the military-political dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Currently, these dynamics are primarily in the hands of the Armed Forces of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Anticipation of Ukrainian Offensive

A key factor influencing Russia's internal decisions, including the potential extension of [[internal_russian_mobilization_and_possible_martial_law | martial law]], is the anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This expectation is described as "meager" and "frankly meager" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Wagner, has recently called for peace, suggesting the task has been completed and a truce should be sought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This call is seen as a recognition of fear regarding the Ukrainian offensive and the high likelihood of the status quo changing in Ukraine's favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. The General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces is reportedly confident in the success of a Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Prigozhin's actions are described as preventive, seeking a truce to stabilize the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Public Sentiment and Economic Concerns

A Levada Center poll from March indicates that the top concern for Russian society is rising prices (58%), while the "special military operation" in Ukraine, conflict with the West, and sanctions concern 33% of respondents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Concerns about human rights violations and suppression of civil liberties are notably low, at only 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

An additional poll shows that every sixth Russian citizen lacks sufficient funds for food and clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Those in the worst economic situation, such as pensioners (27% of those over 60 lacking money for food or clothing), represent the demographic group with the highest support for the Russian president's policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Despite economic hardships, this group remains a key base of support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

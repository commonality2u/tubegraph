## Alexei Navalny's Return to Russia and Political Dynamics

The political landscape in Russia has been significantly shaped by events over the past month and a half to two months, particularly surrounding [[the_poisoning_of_alexei_navalny_and_its_political_implications | Alexei Navalny's]] return to Russia and the subsequent protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Navalny's Return and Protest Response

[[Alexei Navalnys situation | Alexei Navalny's]] act of returning to Russia is described as "undoubtedly a heroic act" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, showcasing bravery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. However, the anticipated "close dynamics of the return" did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Following his return, a film about Putin's palace was released, watched by over 110 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Despite this massive viewership, only approximately 100,000 people took to the streets in protest, representing roughly 0.1% of those who watched the film <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, a result deemed "quite doubtful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a> and a "statistical error" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Analysis of Opposition's Effectiveness

[[Navalnys team and opposition strategies in Russia | Navalny's team]] (FBK) is recognized as "courageous" and composed of "wonderful guys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. However, a professional analysis points to several organizational shortcomings in the protests:
*   **Lack of Organization and Coordination**: Insufficient organization of the protest itself and rally movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Undefined Goals and Slogans**: Protesters lacked specific, clearly set goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, and slogans were "rather dubious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, with not everyone ready to protest "for the release of [[Alexei Navalny's situation | Navalny]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Poor Communication**: Communication between protesters and organizers was "strangely established" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Aimless Participation**: People went out "aimlessly" and "without any prospects for development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

It is suggested that with better organization and coordination, even 30,000 people in Moscow, including 500 "brave and desperate" individuals, could have radically altered the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The refusal of [[Navalnys team and opposition strategies in Russia | FBK]] to continue active protests is viewed as a mistake, though possibly a forced reaction to society's unpreparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Society was likely ready for [[Alexei Navalny's situation | Navalny's]] return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, but many prefer to watch events "comfortably settled on the couch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> rather than act. This inaction is attributed to a "moral weakness" and "unpreparedness of [[Russian nationalism and political tensions | Russian]] society for actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Government's Stance and Future Triggers

The authorities are "making all possible mistakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. It is expected that the upcoming Duma elections will be rigged, serving as another "serious enough trigger" for the protest movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Early presidential elections, initially planned for April, have been postponed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>, and even the president's message to the federal assembly is indefinitely delayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. This interference with plans is seen as a significant achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

Putin is described as "very withdrawn," trusting practically no one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. His main trusted advisors are Nikolai Platonovich Patrushev and Yuri Kovalchuk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Others, like Sechin, are used as intriguers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>, while Kiriyenko is valued for taking responsibility in matters like managing elections and the constitutional vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

Putin treats [[Alexei Navalnys situation | Navalny]] as an "enemy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>, distinct from traitors whom he hates more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. Putin's health is a serious factor affecting his decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, and his fear of manipulation is skillfully exploited to disrupt his plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.

### The Role of the SVR Channel

The SVR telegram channel aims to influence decisions by exposing crimes it knows "firsthand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. The channel, established about 4.5 months ago, has become one of Russia's most popular Telegram channels (ranking fifth in January) and 82nd globally in terms of post reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. Its publications are directed against those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a> and are said to be "seriously shaking the system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>.

The channel claims to have warned Valery Solovyov in July about an assassination attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a> and provided specific details on how to avoid it, including warning Mark Feigin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. While not directly warning [[Alexei Navalnys situation | Alexei Navalny]], Valery Dmitry Solovyov discussed the impending poisoning on his YouTube channel a few days before it occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:08">[00:33:08]</a>. The channel was the first to describe the assassination attempt on [[Alexei Navalnys situation | Navalny]], with its account later confirmed by *The New York Times* and consistent with Bellingcat's investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

### Putin's Internal and External Relationships

Putin's preferred method of engagement is "hybrid war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>, which he finds "much more effective" than hot war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>. This includes frequent cyberattacks on countries like the United States, France, and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

Internationally, Putin respects and fears any US President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>, and views the US as a country he cannot directly oppose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. He also respects the Chinese leader, who holds "quite serious leverage" over him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Angela Merkel is also respected, despite Putin not liking her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:17">[00:28:17]</a>. Erdogan is considered Putin's "alter ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>, especially after Putin's intelligence helped Erdogan avoid a coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.

The relationship between Putin and Lukashenko is characterized by Lukashenko's ability to manipulate Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:12">[00:55:12]</a>. Putin is expected to grant Lukashenko a $3 billion loan, demonstrating his contempt for the Russian population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>.

### Outlook and Recommendations for the Opposition

The current government is in its "worst position" since 1996 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>, making it a critical moment for the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
<br>
> "The government is far from being so reckless, not as confident in itself as it tries to be. An indicator that, on the contrary, it is very unstable and even fragile." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:46">[00:52:46]</a>

The opposition is advised to "seize the moment," mobilize its electorate, and exert "maximum pressure" on the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>. People are "ready for change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:42">[00:50:42]</a>, and those who participated in protests on January 23-31 regret not acting more actively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>. The SVR emphasizes playing by "our rules," not Putin's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

The SVR's strategy focuses on creating a "split in the elites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, as revolutionary change is difficult without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. They have "clearly set goals" and a plan to see Putin in prison "within a year, even during his lifetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### Potential Reforms and Special Services

The reform of Russian special services is considered possible, drawing on the experience of Georgia under Mikheil Saakashvili, where police and special services were completely reformed to eliminate corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>. The primary reform should start with a "complete lustration of the entire judicial corps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>.

[[Russian political leadership transitions and internal power dynamics | Russian special services]] are deemed "quite professional" if the "criminal component" (murder, special operations) is removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>. The failures in the poisonings of Skripal and [[Alexei Navalnys situation | Alexei Navalny]] are attributed to the degradation of "stupid groups of people," not the entire special services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:12">[01:02:12]</a>. If focused on "real threats" rather than fighting opposition or mythical threats, these services can be brought to a "qualitatively new level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. All reforms are believed to be achievable in "quite short terms from a historical perspective" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>.

Recent drone attacks in Moscow and the surrounding region have heightened tensions in Russia, contributing to an "intense and increasingly tense hysterical atmosphere" within the Russian establishment and among some segments of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Kremlin Drone Attack

On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, May 3, 2023, the Moscow Kremlin was attacked by drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. While their origin was initially unknown, it is considered 99.99% certain that these were Ukrainian drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The quick public recognition of this fact by the Kremlin and Russian propaganda was seen as an admission that "things are not going very well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Nature and Purpose of the Attack
The attack was not considered a military or political strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It was not intended to target President Putin, who is "practically never in the Kremlin" and prefers to spend his time in deep bunkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Instead, the attack was symbolic in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. At least one of the two drones was shot down near the Senate building of the Kremlin, where the state flag flies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The primary goal was to demonstrate that the Kremlin is vulnerable and accessible, and that "the Russian flag has fallen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This symbolic act was seen as especially important in Ukraine on the eve of the [[Ukraines potential offensive and its implications | Ukrainian offensive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Preceding Incidents
The Kremlin drone attack followed several other incidents that were "truly military in nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>:
*   Sabotage on railway transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   FSB announcements of a prevented assassination attempt on the head of the Republic of Crimea, Aksyonov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   Drones regularly attacking frontline areas, as well as increasingly Moscow territory and the Moscow region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Societal Impact and Reactions

The increased drone activity has contributed to a "tense hysterical atmosphere" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This tension is characteristic of the Russian establishment across all levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Hysteria is also affecting "mentally unstable layers of Russian society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Public Hysteria and Surveillance
In Moscow and the Moscow region, there has been a "mania for searching and detecting Ukrainian drones" since April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. On one day, up to 100 calls were received from eyewitnesses reporting drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. The overwhelming majority of these calls are considered "absolute nonsense" and are driven by the fears of the callers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

Due to this widespread "mania," Moscow authorities have ordered public utilities to monitor the airspace of the Russian capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This order indicates "strong nervousness" and "strong tension" rather than panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. On May 3, the Moscow mayor banned the launch of all drones, except for competent authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Calls for Martial Law
Following the drone attacks and rising tensions, Security Council Secretary Patrushev demanded that President Putin immediately impose martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Martial law is already in effect in the "new territories" or "new regions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The proposal was to extend martial law to the Russian capital, frontline regions, and potentially other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

President Putin has postponed a decision on this matter until the end of the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. He is unlikely to make a decision before May 9, as authorities want to hold the Victory Day parade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Putin is also hesitant because introducing martial law would diminish his power in favor of the security officers who would control it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Implications of Martial Law
The potential implementation of martial law, or elements of it without a formal declaration, would entail significant restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>:
*   **Restriction of Civil Rights and Freedoms** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Travel Ban:** Those subject to military service, estimated at over 15 million people, could be banned from leaving the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Movement Restrictions:** Limitations on movement between regions could be introduced, along with strengthened passport control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Freedom of Speech:** Restriction of freedom of speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Internment:** The possibility of internment, allowing detention without trial or investigation for up to 30 days, extendable thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Conscription:** Conscription would become much easier to carry out, with existing formal restrictions potentially ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Mass Checks:** Mass checks of conscription-eligible individuals and those liable for military service are already starting in some cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Financial Restrictions:** Potentially blocking bank cards and accounts for those potentially subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The Central Bank reportedly confirmed readiness for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

The extent of these restrictions will depend heavily on the position of local authorities, who will negotiate the measures to be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Moscow Mayor Sobyanin, for instance, is expected to try and protect his voters to maintain their loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

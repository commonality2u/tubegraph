The West's approach to Russia has changed, particularly concerning [[role_and_perception_of_russian_leadership_and_power_structures | Russia's leadership]] and its [[russian_elites_reaction_to_putins_leadership | ruling group]]. This shift is evident in the increased allowance of strikes on Russian territory and the relaxed stance on the risk of nuclear escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Reasons for the Shift

The primary reason for this change in Western perception is the belief that the former leader, referred to as "Putin," is no longer alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

### Former Perception of "Putin"
Previously, Western nations were apprehensive of "Putin" because they perceived him as "crazy" and "dangerously crazy" in a clinical sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. He was seen as suffering from a fatal disease and willing to "drown the whole world in blood and fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. This fear dictated their cautious approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

### Current Perception of the Ruling Group
In contrast, the current [[russian_elites_reaction_to_putins_leadership | ruling group]] is viewed by the West as more realistic in its outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. They believe this group does not wish to ignite a thermonuclear war that would consume the world, including themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>. The West also perceives that this group has "built-in lines of limitation" within itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

This understanding has led to a more relaxed and "carefree" attitude from American officials regarding the risk of nuclear strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. They openly state that they do not see any signs of Russia preparing such strikes and are "not afraid of this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

## Consequences of the Shift

The belief that "Putin is gone" means the West can act differently than when he was in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. While risks of escalation remain, they are considered to have "decreased" significantly compared to a year or even six months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This has influenced Western allies to interpret the situation as an "instruction" for broader opportunities in using weapons supplied to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

### Strikes on Russian Territory
The West does not recognize Crimea as sovereign Russian territory, allowing Ukrainian forces to strike military and infrastructure facilities there for a considerable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. However, the current situation permits strikes with Western weapons on what is considered "root Russian territory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. The Western authorization for these strikes is perceived as a significant change, happening "massively" and "hastily," with a "sluggish" Russian reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

### Impact on Conflict Dynamics
These massive strikes by Western weapons on Russian military facilities and critical infrastructure, while not expected to be a "strategic turning point" leading to Ukraine's military victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, are capable of:
*   Weakening Russia's offensive impulse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.
*   Causing serious damage to Russian armed forces and their logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

Ultimately, this situation is expected to lead to another "strategic impasse" by autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This impasse might incentivize a transition to direct peaceful consultations between Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Russia has already made an offer for such consultations, conveyed through Western allies, but it was rejected by Ukraine a month prior to this discussion due to unacceptable conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. However, it is speculated that perceptions might change on both sides by September, potentially increasing Russia's readiness for a "very broad compromise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. The [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | internal political dynamics]] and a potentially "unforeseen" or "destructive" transition in Russia could further impact Ukraine's strategic position and willingness to engage in peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

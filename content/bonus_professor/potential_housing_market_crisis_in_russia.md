Valery Solovey, in the 16th episode of "What is Happening," discussed the impending "threatening catastrophe" within Russia, specifically focusing on the country's [[socioeconomic_challenges_in_russia | internal Russian socio-economic problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This includes a detailed look at the challenging situation within the housing market.

## Housing Market as an Economic Indicator

The housing market is often considered a key indicator of a nation's economic health, with demand for housing signaling a developing or stable economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. However, in Russia, the situation is described as "pre-catastrophic" and is expected to soon become "catastrophic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Key Factors Contributing to the Crisis

The construction industry in Russia is currently experiencing the highest growth rate of debt among all industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This is primarily due to:

*   **Rising Key Rate of the Central Bank** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>: The key rate is expected to increase from 21% to 23% this month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, with a target indicator of 35% at the beginning of next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   **Inability to Repay Loans and Sell Housing** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>: Construction companies are struggling to repay loans and simultaneously sell off the housing they have built. Approximately 60% of apartments in new buildings remain unsold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

### Consequences for the Market

A pessimistic scenario predicts an "inevitable" collapse of the construction market, leading to bankruptcies of construction companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. While small and medium-sized companies are expected to be hit hardest, large companies might survive by taking out more loans and reducing their workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

*   **Company Examples**:
    *   Pika, a large Moscow developer, is already reducing its workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
    *   An owner of Airplane, another major Moscow developer, is urgently attempting to sell his 36% share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Impact on Consumers**: There is concern for those who bought apartments at the excavation stage or who have already acquired property, facing uncertain futures akin to past instances of unfortunate developers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

### Housing Prices and Inflation

Housing prices may initially decrease as developers try to offload unsold properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. However, due to severe inflation forecasts, prices are expected to rise later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Unofficial data suggests inflation exceeded 90% between 2022 and 2023, with prices nearly doubling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. For the next year, inflation growth is predicted to be between 100% and 200% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## Government's Approach to the Crisis

The current Russian authorities intend to manage the impending [[russian_economic_crisis_and_forecasts | economic catastrophe]] using "Old Soviet, even Bolshevik patterns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. This approach includes:

*   Deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>
*   Food cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>
*   Special distributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>
*   "Honest" (in quotes) taking of money from the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>

The government's strategy is to emerge from the crisis at the expense of society, disregarding the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. The crisis is deemed inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

## Public Recommendations

To navigate these challenging times, individuals are advised to:

*   **Create Local Mutual Aid Networks**: Agree with others facing similar problems on how to help each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. This might involve tasks like taking turns queuing for social products, reminiscent of the Soviet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
*   **Support the Elderly**: The crisis, especially food shortages, will heavily impact children and the elderly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. Younger and middle-aged individuals are urged to regularly check on elderly parents and relatives, providing support and finding out their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.
*   **Prepare for Difficult Times**: While the speaker expresses confidence in overcoming the crisis, the cost will be significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. He encourages listeners to help in any way possibleâ€”information, psychological support, or financial assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>.

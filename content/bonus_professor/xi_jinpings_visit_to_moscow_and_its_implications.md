Valery Solovey's 14th episode of "Answers to Hot Questions" addresses user questions, a significant portion of which were devoted to [[xi_jinpings_visit_to_moscow | Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Summary of the Visit's Outcome

The visit was summarized as:
*   Successful and useful for China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Unsuccessful and not useful for the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   Disappointing for President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Benefits for China

China gained several significant advantages from the visit:
*   **Energy Deals**
    *   Access to cheap gas with a huge discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
    *   An obligation for Russia to build a new liquefied natural gas pipeline at Russia's expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, with gas supplied at a colossal discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Economic Commitments**
    *   Russia's commitments to all investment projects China is interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
    *   Consent to all of China's economic requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Currency Adoption**
    *   Russia agreed to pay in yuan for trade with Latin America and Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This is beneficial exclusively to China as it expands the yuan's global appeal and ties Russia more closely to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This reverses Russia's earlier stance of paying exclusively in rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Disappointments for Russia and Putin

In return for its concessions, the Russian Federation received "beautiful, high-flown, flowery oriental formulas" about being "reliable partners" who "together resist the attempts of the low device of modern peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

President Putin was particularly disappointed because:
*   **No Lethal Military Equipment**
    *   The Chinese did not promise to supply Russia with lethal military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. China already supplies non-lethal goods for the armed forces and will continue to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   Russia is in dire need of military equipment to repel a Ukrainian counteroffensive expected in the spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   China vaguely indicated readiness to revisit the issue in the summer, intending to observe the results of the Ukrainian counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Rushing to supply weapons could worsen relations with the United States if the armament proves unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Symbolic Dominance**
    *   China responded to Russia's requests with "friendly reprimands," affectionately patting President Putin on the shoulder or cheek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This gesture, previously observed in Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, indicates that "only a very strong and self-confident party that believes that it dominates the other party that is being patted on the cheek can afford such a gesture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Rhetoric during Discussions**
    *   During negotiations with [[xi_jinpings_visit_to_moscow | Xi Jinping]], Putin motivated the need for Chinese weapons by stating that Russia "cannot lose" and would have "no other choice" but to use tactical nuclear weapons in the event of a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## Broader Implications

*   **Shift in Global Status**
    *   Russia is no longer speaking of multipolarity and is in the process of turning into a vassal state of China, with China effectively becoming its suzerain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This is described as an ongoing process, "very, very far from its completion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **China's View on Russian Domestic Politics**
    *   China is indifferent to who governs Russia—whether Putin, Dmitry Patrushev, or Mishustin—as long as Russia fulfills its obligations to China and remains politically stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
    *   A meeting in an expanded format with Prime Minister Mishustin was perceived as a "bride show," with [[xi_jinpings_visit_to_moscow | Xi Jinping]] closely examining Mishustin and inviting him to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This suggests China is selecting a "future Russian bride" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Past Misjudgment by Xi Jinping**
    *   [[xi_jinpings_visit_to_moscow | Xi Jinping]] made a "very serious mistake" in February of the previous year by giving consent to Putin for a "lightning fast and large-scale military operation" that Putin assured would lead to Russia's triumphant success in days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Putin's Occult Practices

Putin typically participates in occult events, such as rituals on the vernal equinox, but was unable to do so during [[xi_jinpings_visit_to_moscow | Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow]], which greatly upset him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

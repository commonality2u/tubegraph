The [[political_situation_in_russia | internal political situation in Russia]] is characterized by shifting political claims, a deepening mobilization of the economy, increased repression, and a growing concern within the Kremlin regarding "turbo patriots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Evolution of Kremlin's Stated Goals

The initial goals for the "special military operation" were to "deNazify" and "demilitarize" Ukraine, and to force NATO to retreat to its 1997 borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. However, the slowness of the Russian armed forces' advance has led to a reduction in the public political claims of the Kremlin and President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. During a visit to Central Asia, Putin stated the operation's goal is now "to liberate Donbass and guarantee the security of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Despite this, the length of the border of contact between NATO and the Russian Federation has almost doubled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## Economic Mobilization and Labor Control

The Russian government is introducing amendments to federal law to develop a mobilization model of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. These "special measures" in the economic sphere allow authorities to prohibit firms, organizations, and enterprises—regardless of ownership form—from refusing government military orders and contracts related to armed actions outside Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Businesses will be obliged to supply goods, perform work, and provide services for military operations abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

Furthermore, these measures permit authorities to change contract terms during implementation and interfere with labor relations within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Employees can be compelled to work at night, on weekends, and holidays, and without vacations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This system is likened to the Soviet era when the economy was heavily connected to the military-industrial complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The government declares to the Russian people that they "will work around the clock and without days off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This move is seen as Russia sliding into a strategic trap, depleting its material, human, and moral resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

## Shifting Focus of Kremlin Concern

The Kremlin's primary concern has shifted from liberal critics, who mainly broadcast from outside Russia, to "turbo patriots" or "hurray patriots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. These super-loyalists criticize the Kremlin for perceived concessions, such as fighter exchanges, and for not acting quickly or harshly enough in the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

The FSB has been instructed to "thin out the ranks" of these zealous critics on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. This signals that the right to determine what is fair or needed belongs solely to the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Regardless of one's stance on the operation, the expectation is to "keep your mouth shut and enthusiastically approve... all the actions of the authorities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

## Potential Succession and Political Probes

Information is circulating about Dmitry Nikolaevich Patrushev, the current Minister of Agriculture and son of influential Nikolai Platonovich Patrushev, being a potential candidate for president and Putin's successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. There are also discussions about his potential appointment as Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. This is interpreted as a "sounding out" of the political class, particularly provincial officials, to prepare them for a potential change in prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. This "probe" into Dmitry Patrushev is considered serious and is influencing the behavior of the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

## Repressions and Cultural Restrictions

Repressions continue, including the house arrest of Vladimir Mau, a highly influential rector and head of the Academy of National Economy and Public Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. This is seen as a signal to all systemic liberals that their loyalty is "worth absolutely nothing" to the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.

In the cultural sphere, the Gogol Center, a "highly useful and fascinating place," is being reverted to the Gogol Theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. This is attributed to the government's introduction of a mobilization regime, which leads to "simplification" and rejects "cultural complexities," whether opposition-aligned or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

## Investor Treatment

Gazprom's refusal to pay dividends for the first time since 1998, reportedly on direct state orders, sends a message to private investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. The state views private investors as "freeloaders" and asserts that "nothing belongs to you and will never belong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. This exemplifies the regime's move towards a mobilization economy, accompanied by restrictions, harshness, simplification, and pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

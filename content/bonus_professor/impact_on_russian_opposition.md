The news of Alexei Navalny's death or killing on Friday, February 16, 2024, prompted an emergency program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Death of Alexei Navalny

Condolences were extended to Navalny's relatives, family, and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, as well as to all who worked with him, collaborated, or sympathized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Despite his official designation as a "terrorist extremist," the speaker expressed condolences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Navalny was praised for his "amazing quality" of commitment to his goals and objectives, which was considered a "great achievement and a distinctive quality" of him as a politician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Circumstances and Suspicions

The speaker is inclined to believe Navalny's death was a political murder rather than a natural one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. An international etiological investigation would be needed to convince him otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Even if the death were natural, the Kremlin is accused of creating "impossible conditions" for years, including nearly a year in a punishment cell, intended to critically impact his health and psyche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Indirect signs pointing to political murder include:
*   A "very quick, unanimous reaction" from the [[russian_political_climate_and_mobilization | Russian official media]], reporting the news "on command" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   An "unusually quick reaction" from Peskov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   At least two or three recent assassination attempts in the past month on "very dangerous and important opponents" of the elite group claiming full power in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

The speaker anticipates "cynical lies and real nonsense" about the circumstances of Navalny's death, including claims he is alive abroad or that the West sacrificed him to compromise the "presidential elections" or blur the effect of [[potential_political_consequences_for_putin_and_russian_establishment | Putin]]'s interview with Tucker Carlson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This is described as "blurring" tactics by PR professionals to distract from the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The argument that it was "unprofitable for the Kremlin" is dismissed as a recurring, false argument also heard regarding the murder of Nemtsov, the poisoning of Navalny, and the start of the military operation against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Kremlin's Alleged Motives

The speaker asserts Navalny's death was "profitable, logical, and consistent" for the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The individuals who conceived the poisoning operation against Navalny are believed to be the same people who completed this operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. The primary motive is to "remove any risks, remove any threats" on the eve of the "so-called presidential elections" and, more importantly, on the eve of the [[potential_political_crisis_in_russia | transfer of power]] to the elite group aspiring to full power in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The aim is to "get rid of the slightest risks," "squeeze out all the grass," and "cement all the fields where this grass may appear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

The authorities can easily refute slander by inviting international and Western experts, particularly from Germany where Navalny was previously diagnosed, to conduct a public international examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. They should also give the body to the family for disposal, rather than the Federal Penitentiary Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Broader Threat to [[current_and_future_prospects_for_russian_opposition | Opposition]]

Navalny had "colossal political potential" that he had not yet fully utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. His death is a "serious warning" that [[conflict_within_the_russian_opposition_and_its_implications | Russian oppositionists]] are under threat, both those remaining in Russia and those abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Lessons and Future Outlook

A key lesson from Navalny's death is to "love those who are alive," whether free or imprisoned, rather than only appreciating the dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. There was much slander against Navalny when he was alive, with even his imprisonment being suspected as a "cunningly conceived game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

The speaker predicts "very difficult events this year," specifically in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The year "will not just be dramatic, it can turn out to be and most likely will turn out to be tragic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. It is expected to be "much harder" than the year the pandemic began or the year the special military operation began, potentially being the "hardest year in our entire life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

[!NOTE] Call to Action
Individuals are urged to take care of their health, help family and friends, and be close to them, as family and friends are "the key to our stability and the key and conditions for our survival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Despite the tragic day and difficult future, the speaker expresses confidence and hope that "everything will change for the better and will begin to change already in this 2024" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The conviction remains that "victory will be ours for the sake of Alexei, for the sake of all of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

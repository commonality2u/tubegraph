The political landscape in Dagestan and the broader North Caucasus region is characterized by complex internal dynamics and external influences.

## Governance in Dagestan
Dagestan is described as an ethnically complex, multi-component region with an incessant struggle for resources and power, where power itself is considered a resource <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Due to this internal complexity, the Federal Center is compelled to appoint a "Varangian" (an outsider ruler) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. This appointed ruler is intended to remain conditionally equally distant from the various ethnic groups within the republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. While not considered a democratic decision, it is currently seen as the only possible approach given the situation in Dagestan and the [[political_situation_in_russia | Russian Federation]] as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## External Influences and Tensions
The influence of Ramzan Akhmatovich Kadyrov, the head of Chechnya, is unlikely to be significantly inferior to that of the federal center in the North Caucasus, causing strong irritation within Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Recent events, such as the awarding of medals to Kadyrov's son, Adam, from various North Caucasian republics, suggest this continued strong influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

There is a tightening of relations between the new government, led by Nikolai Patrushev, and Chechnya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. This policy is seen by many observers as indicative of creating a conflict situation, potentially transitioning to open conflict with the Chechen Republic's leadership, which could lead to unpleasant consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

## South Caucasus Dynamics
Despite imperial statements by figures like Lavrov about Russia's firm intention not to allow South Caucasus states to freely choose their development paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:42:00">[25:42:00]</a>, Russia's actual influence in the region is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:00">[26:00:00]</a>. Russia currently cannot prevent Armenia from leaving the CSTO, even though this is strongly disliked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:00">[26:02:00]</a>. Furthermore, Russia's ability to influence the fate of Georgia is not significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:10:00">[26:10:00]</a>. This is attributed to Russia's soft levers of influence and Georgia's role as a crucial channel for re-export to Russia, making pressure impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:19:00">[26:19:00]</a>. Future relations between Russia and the South Caucasus region are expected to change significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>.

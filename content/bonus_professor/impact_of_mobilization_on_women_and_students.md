From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The upcoming [[issues_related_to_military_mobilization_and_its_impact | mobilization]] in Russia is expected to be more organized and tougher than the first round, and is anticipated to be declared as a [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | general mobilization]] after the New Year holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This new phase is planned to occur in conjunction with the introduction of [[Impact of mobilization and martial law in Russia | martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, which is projected to extend to a significant portion of Russia, including Moscow and St. Petersburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Impact on Women

There are intentions to mobilize a significant number of women, specifically 300,000, after the New Year holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

> "We are talking about the intention to mobilize not 300, 400, 500, and if we are lucky, up to two million people, including 300 thousand women, including 300 thousand women, after the New Year after the New Year holidays." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>

Regarding which women will be affected, it is understood that doctors and medical personnel would be prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. However, there is uncertainty about other specialties or criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

The ability for women not subject to [[mobilization and military efforts | mobilization]] to leave the country after the New Year is hoped to remain possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The complex of [[mobilization and military efforts | mobilization]] measures and the maintenance of [[Impact of mobilization and martial law in Russia | martial law]] are expected to take place after the holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Social and Protest Dynamics

The readiness of Russian women to protest is reported to be gradually increasing, contrasting with official sociological agency reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. This suggests a growing [[psychological_impact_of_mobilization | psychological impact of mobilization]] leading to potential [[social_and_national_implications_of_mobilization | social unrest]].

## Impact on Students

For full-time students with a military ID, [[mobilization and legal grounds | mobilization]] is considered unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. However, students in their final year of study may face a risk of being mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Broader Context of Mobilization

The planned [[issues_related_to_military_mobilization and its impact | mobilization]] is extensive, with up to 7 million people potentially subject to it in the border service database, meaning they would be unable to leave the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. While not all 7 million are expected to be mobilized, long-term plans suggest up to two million people, including 300,000 women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Doubts exist regarding the authorities' ability to adequately provide uniforms, equipment, and other necessary provisions for such a large number of mobilized individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### [[Impact of mobilization and martial law in Russia | Martial Law]] Provisions

The introduction of [[Impact of mobilization and martial law in Russia | martial law]] grants authorities rights that could significantly affect the population, including:
*   **Labor [[mobilization and legal grounds | mobilization]]**: Individuals not called to active military service can be subject to forced labor [[mobilization and legal grounds | mobilization]], applying to people aged 14 to 60 or 65, who may be sent to work to strengthen the country's defense capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Forced change of ownership**: Organizations or enterprises may undergo forced changes in ownership, potentially leading to nationalization of large corporate or private business property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Seizure of private property**: Private property may be seized, with subsequent compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Restriction of communication and information**: [[Impact of mobilization and martial law in Russia | Martial law]] provides for the possibility of restricting freedom of communication and the use of information, potentially leading to internet censorship or blocking platforms like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### Financial Implications

The speaker addresses [[financial_implications_of_mobilization | financial implications]] such as loans and mortgages in the event of [[partial_mobilization and its implications | general mobilization]]. A deferment of payments would likely be announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. If a mobilized individual dies at the front, there is uncertainty about whether debts would be written off for the family or if preferential payment terms would be offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Currency deposits in banks are already frozen and forcibly converted into rubles, making it unlikely for individuals to retrieve them in their original currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Ruble deposits are not considered under threat, as the Central Bank can print more rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. However, the ruble is expected to depreciate catastrophically during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

### [[Reliability of information on mobilization | Reliability of Information]]

Summonses are reportedly ready in Moscow, and photos of those subject to [[mobilization and military efforts | mobilization]] are being entered into the facial recognition system, particularly effective in the Moscow metro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This system could be used to approach individuals and direct them to [[mobilization and military efforts | mobilization]] points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The slogan "everything for the front, everything for Victory" will underpin [[mobilization and military efforts | mobilization]] efforts and [[Impact of mobilization and martial law in Russia | martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

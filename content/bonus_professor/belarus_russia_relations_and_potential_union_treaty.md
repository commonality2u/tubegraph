The relationship between Belarus and Russia is complex, marked by political upheaval in Belarus and [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russia's strategy and relations with Belarus]] to maintain influence.

## Belarusian Elections and Unrest
Prior to recent presidential elections in Belarus, unrest was anticipated, which has since escalated into "millions of rallies" [00:00:14]. Many European countries, including Ukraine, have officially not recognized the election results and did not congratulate Lukashenko on his victory [00:00:30]. Despite the significant public uprising, the "Belarusian revolution" is described as reaching a "dead end," as the popular impulse is currently "not enough to overthrow Lukashenko" or achieve a decisive victory [00:00:43].

## Russia's Proposed Compromise for Belarus
A compromise is likely to emerge from the current situation, with its formula having been discussed during telephone conversations between [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] and [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] [00:01:01].

The proposed compromise outlined includes:
*   [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] remaining president of Belarus for no longer than a year [00:01:15].
*   Following this period, [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] will announce early presidential elections after a new constitution is adopted [00:01:20].
*   During this transitional period, [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] must sign a new union treaty with [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russia]] [00:01:27].
*   [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] is not expected to run in these early presidential elections; instead, Babarika is anticipated to become the candidate [00:01:31].
*   This arrangement would lead to Belarus gaining a "new non-authoritarian president," while [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russia]] resolves the issue of control over Belarus [00:01:42].
*   [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] would then move to Moscow and become secretary of the State Council, a new body planned for creation in [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russia]] [00:01:50].
*   In the event of "very strong pressure" on [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]], there remains an option for early elections to be held sooner, potentially even within the current year, but "with the same results" [00:02:00].

[[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]]'s public statement about [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russia]] having prepared reserves to aid [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] is interpreted as a desire to compel the Belarusian opposition and society to negotiate this compromise [00:02:21].

### Russia's Military Aid to Belarus
[[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] has claimed that an external factor is influencing the rallies in Belarus [00:02:40]. While an external factor exists, it is not considered of primary importance [00:02:47]. Groups of consultants, including American specialists in political technologies, are attempting to assist the opposition, but their role is not decisive [00:02:55]. It is stressed that the revolution is not merely externally provoked, similar to how the "revolution of dignity" in Ukraine was not solely provoked by the Americans [00:03:09].

The European Union, in fact, sought a compromise with Yanukovych in February of the 14th year [00:03:28]. While external intervention is present, it is "not key for the dynamics of events" [00:03:36]. If anyone has a "key impact," it is the [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russian Federation]] [00:03:43].

[[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] confirmed in an interview that [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russia]] has reserves ready to help [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]], and that [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] himself requested this assistance [00:03:51]. However, this declaration is considered "nothing more than a warning" or a rhetorical figure [00:04:14]. Neither [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] nor [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] desires the use of force, as it would severely damage [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | relations between Russians and Belarusians]], just as it "poisoned" [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | relations between Russians and Ukrainians]] [00:04:23].

[[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] had previously told Merkel, even before the Navalny poisoning, that [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russia]] would not introduce armed forces into Belarus [00:04:41]. The "reserve" [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] referred to is not the army, but rather the "force of the Cross Guard and OMON" [00:04:53]. Approximately 200-300 people from the Rosguard are currently in Belarus, predominantly "former fighters of the Ukrainian Berkut" who fled Ukraine in spring 2014 [00:04:58].

## Lukashenko's Future and Belarus's Independence
[[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] has publicly stated he will "never voluntarily leave his position" because he believes he was elected by his people, implying he could only be removed by being killed [00:05:24]. If [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] becomes an "insurmountable obstacle" to [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russian control over Belarus]], "troubles can befall him" [00:05:44]. While [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] is confident such troubles won't happen, it is suggested he "exaggerates his ability to survive" [00:05:57].

Should Belarus sign the discussed union treaty after [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]]'s departure, it would effectively "turn into a western province of the [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russian Federation]]" [00:06:16]. Belarus would cede "95 percent of its national powers in favor of the union state" [00:06:20].

## Impact on Donbass Negotiations
There is currently no discussion of changing the negotiating platform for Donbass, and Minsk remains the location [00:06:48]. However, the [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russian delegation]] will likely be strengthened, possibly with Vladislav Surkov returning to the Ukrainian direction of [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russian policy]] [00:06:52]. In extreme circumstances, negotiations could be transferred to Almaty [00:07:00]. The return of Surkov is attributed to the need to "intensify the negotiating process," which is currently at a "dead end" [00:07:28].

[[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] was "very unhappy" with Surkov after a Normandy format meeting where the Ukrainian side refused to comply with prior agreements [00:07:51]. Despite this, it is now difficult to proceed without Surkov, as [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] "cannot do without" him in certain situations [00:08:37].

## Future of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus
The future relations between [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russia]], Ukraine, and Belarus will be decisively shaped by a "very powerful and radical political crisis" expected to develop within the [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russian Federation]] [00:09:07]. This crisis is predicted to change the mode of relations between [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russia]] and its neighbors, particularly Ukraine and Belarus [00:09:27]. [[russias_strategy_and_relations_with_belarus | Russia]] will be preoccupied with internal problems, and [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] is expected to leave power, leading to new leadership, a new agenda, and a new style of relations [00:09:34].

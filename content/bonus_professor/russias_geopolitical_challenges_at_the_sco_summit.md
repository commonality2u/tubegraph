The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, in September 2022, is characterized as a significant "failure" for Russia and its President, Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This perceived failure manifested in four key aspects: image/symbolic, geopolitical, economic, and physiological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Symbolic and Image Failure

The summit highlighted a diminished international standing for Russia and its leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>:
*   **Protocol Discrepancies**: Unlike previous engagements where Putin often kept other leaders waiting, in Samarkand, he was met by the Prime Minister of Uzbekistan, while the host President met other leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Putin himself had to wait for leaders from India, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Kyrgyzstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Visual Representation**: A widely circulated photograph from the summit depicted Turkish President Erdogan comfortably seated in the center, with Azerbaijan's Aliyev nearby. Putin, in contrast, was positioned on a sofa between the presidents of Belarus and Tajikistan, suggesting a lower status from the organizers' perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Submissive Posture**: The Prime Minister of India adopted a didactic tone with Putin, questioning Russia's actions in the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Putin was observed making excuses to the Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. When asked about the situation in Ukraine, Putin's "cheerful" response that "everything is going according to plan" was met with an ironic smile and head shake from Comrade Xi, indicating clear distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Geopolitical Realignment

The summit underscored a significant shift in power dynamics within the post-Soviet space and Central Asia, revealing [[geopolitical_tensions_and_russias_international_relationships | geopolitical tensions]] and a decline in [[geopolitical_strategies_and_positioning_of_russia | Russian influence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>:
*   **Rise of China and Turkey**: China and Turkey emerged as the true leaders and new contenders for leadership in Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. These countries are actively and successfully developing the post-Soviet space, traditionally considered Russia's undisputed sphere of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Kazakhstan's Assertiveness**: During his trip, Comrade Xi publicly stated that China is the guarantor of Kazakhstan's sovereignty and territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The President of Kazakhstan not only avoided direct communication with Putin at the summit but demonstratively did so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Kazakhstan has also privately informed the Russian leadership that it intends to suspend its membership in the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) from the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Central Asian Conflicts**: The conflict between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan saw neither country initially turn to Moscow for mediation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Putin had to proactively offer Russia's services as a mediator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, highlighting a weakening of Moscow's traditional client relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Karabakh and Armenia**: In the latest military clash between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Karabakh, Armenia did not receive Russia's support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Putin offered to defend Armenia's territorial integrity only if it joined the union state, explicitly excluding Karabakh from this guarantee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Moscow's actions revealed it as an unreliable mediator, contributing to the likely collapse of the CSTO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Alternative Influences**: In the Greater South Caucasus, the United States is emerging as an alternative to Russian influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Economic Shortcomings

Russia's economic position at the summit was also poor, contributing to [[russian_economic_issues_and_potential_crises | economic challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>:
*   **Lack of Leverage**: Putin reportedly had little to offer summit participants beyond resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   **China's Rejection**: When Putin proposed building the "Power of Siberia 2" gas pipeline to China, Comrade Xi ironically shook his head, indicating China had no need for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Physiological Concerns

Concerns about President Putin's health were also noted, contributing to [[russian_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | political dynamics]] in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>:
*   **Observable Health**: Many observers noted Putin's "terrible physical and mental shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. A mini-video showed Erdogan, who has serious diabetes, carefully supporting Putin's elbow to help him maintain pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   **Physical Limitations**: The summit's demands appeared to be physically and mentally too taxing for the Russian President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Medical Attention**: Earlier, during Putin's visit to the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, 12 doctors were reportedly waiting for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. His "strange statements" and mannerisms at the summit were publicly displayed, indicating issues with his mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

> [!INFO] Growing Weakness
> Dozens and hundreds of attentive, trained eyes are watching the Russian president, who started such a mess in Europe and in the post-Soviet space. These eyes are for the most part completely unfriendly, and it is difficult for him to count on a well-wisher in the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

The collective impact of these failures at the SCO summit underscores Russia's increasingly isolated and weakened position on the global stage, foreshadowing [[geopolitical_consequences_and_crisis_predictions_in_russia | negative consequences]] for the country.

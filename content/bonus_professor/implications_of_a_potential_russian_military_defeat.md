The possibility of a Russian military defeat carries significant implications for Russian domestic and foreign policy, as well as the personal destiny of President Putin and his regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

### Western Stance: A Crusade Against Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
The Munich conference effectively declared a "crusade" against President Putin personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The West's primary objectives are to:
*   Bring [[military_and_strategic_implications_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | military defeat]] to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   Deprive Russia of all territorial acquisitions in Ukraine, including Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   Not be deterred by any threats from Putin or Russia, including the use of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

It is suggested that the West is intentionally provoking Putin to react harshly, possibly to incite his inner circle to take decisive action to prevent "inadequate actions" by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This stance constitutes an ultimatum directed personally against the Russian President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

### China's Shifting Position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
China's position is described as "very interesting and ambiguous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. While China expresses categorical opposition to unilateral sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, it is gradually moving towards the Western coalition's stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. China insists on peace and is prepared to present its own Peace Plan, which is "based on respect for the sovereignty of both parties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This implies Russia must renounce its territorial claims from Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

China's intention to present this plan indicates a long period of development and signals that China does not believe in the possibility of [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Victory of the Russian Federation]] or in President Putin's strategic genius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. A potential meeting between Xi Jinping and Putin was made conditional on Russia achieving a decisive victory or agreeing to peace; the "decisive victory" option is now considered "crossed out" by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Internal Outlook on Russian Military Success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>
The Russian Federation has not achieved "fateful successes" in Ukraine, and its goals have not been met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Despite the Kremlin's public assertions that "everything is going according to plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, the situation on the ground is deteriorating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

The [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russian military]] itself reportedly does not want to go on the offensive, believing it would be a "big mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. They assess that there is "practically no chance of success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, indicating a poor moral and psychological state among the Russian armed forces and command staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This internal skepticism suggests that the actual reluctance of command staff could escalate into sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

Furthermore, there is an acute shortage of weapons in the Russian armed forces, relying on remnants of Soviet-era armaments rather than new, advanced ones in sufficient quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. In contrast, Ukraine is receiving advanced Western weapons, which are expected to significantly increase Russian losses and are considered key to a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

### Potential Consequences of Defeat

A military defeat for Russia is expected to have "quick" and "immediate political conclusions" for Putin's personal destiny and the destiny of the [[potential_changes_in_russian_leadership_and_implications | political regime]] he created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

If Putin cannot avoid military defeat, as Margarita Simonyan suggests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>, his only remaining option might be to resort to nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This is a course of action that both China and the West have warned against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. The risk of nuclear weapon use is described as "colossal," with Putin psychologically and morally ready for such a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. The world has not been this close to the possibility of nuclear weapons use since the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>.

Ultimately, a military defeat could lead to the need to re-establish Russia as a Republican, democratic, and federal state, as the current constitution and republic are considered to have been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

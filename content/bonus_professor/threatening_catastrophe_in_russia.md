Valery Solovey presents the 16th episode of "What is Happening," focusing on the threatening catastrophe facing Russia and how the authorities intend to address it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The discussion centers exclusively on internal Russian socio-economic problems, which are described as being of an "insoluble nature" for Russian society and state power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. While important and potentially very significant political events are occurring at the highest levels of Russian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, these are not the primary focus of this discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Current Crisis Points

The current situation is characterized by a series of escalating socio-economic problems, which are already having significant impacts on the population.

### Food Crisis

The introduction of food cards is highlighted as a critical sign of severe economic distress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

*   **Implementation**: Food cards are becoming commonplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. They will be introduced in the Kaliningrad region after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, and a State Duma head has proposed extending them to the entire territory of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. They are already partly introduced for some positions in other cities, notably Kamchatka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: Theoretically, these cards provide an opportunity for socially disadvantaged populations, particularly pensioners whose income is below the subsistence minimum, to "buy food and other necessary products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The key distinction is that these items must be purchased at "social prices," not received for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
*   **Cause**: The primary reason for introducing food cards is a severe lack of harvests in the Russian Federation, which is the most serious in over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The most acute shortage of provisions is expected in the Trans-Urals and Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Quality and Availability**: Reports from Kamchatka indicate that fish bought with these discounted cards is "awful," with meat falling off bones upon defrosting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. It is anticipated that the provisions available via social food cards will be illiquid goods or items that need to be "dumped" by food chains or manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Comparison to the US**: While the US has food stamp programs (received by 41.5 million people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, those provisions are received for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> and are of normal quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. In Russia, people must buy items and the quality will be very poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   **Future Outlook**: The card system is expected to be extended to the entire country, at varying speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This represents a full restoration of a "special investigation" system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. High-quality provisions will become very expensive, while low-quality provisions will be necessary for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

### Housing Market Collapse

The housing market is considered a key indicator of economic health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. The current situation in Russia's housing market is described as "pre-catastrophic" and soon to become catastrophic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

*   **Debt Growth**: The construction industry leads all industries in debt growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Rising Key Rate**: The Central Bank's key rate is expected to rise from 21% to 23% this month, and then by 10-12 points at the beginning of next year, with a target indicator of 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Developer Distress**: Construction companies cannot repay loans and are struggling to sell built housing, with approximately 60% of new apartments remaining unsold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This points to an inevitable collapse of the construction market and bankruptcies, especially among small and medium-sized companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Large developers are also affected; an owner of "Airplane," a major Moscow developer, is urgently trying to sell their share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
*   **Impact on Buyers**: Many people who bought apartments during the excavation stage or with existing "boxes" face the prospect of becoming "unfortunate developers" who struggle for decades to get their property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
*   **Prices**: Housing prices may initially decrease as developers try to offload unsold stock, but then are expected to rise due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

### Freezing Deposits

A third critical aspect of the crisis involves discussions around freezing deposits, with the "Cypriot scenario" being the most intensively discussed and closest to implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

*   **Mechanism**: All funds exceeding the insurance amount (currently 1,400,000 rubles in Russia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a> would be converted into bank shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. These shares would then be frozen, meaning depositors would not be able to dispose of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **Total Deposit Consideration**: The insurance amount will be considered for the total deposit per person, regardless of how many banks the funds are spread across <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Public Reaction**: The state expects a neutral or even approving reaction from society, as 97.5% of deposits are less than 1,400,000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. This means the majority would not suffer under this option, while those with deposits over 10 million rubles (accounting for almost a third of total deposits) would be affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>.
*   **Restrictions**: Even the insurance amount of 1,400,000 rubles may come with restrictions on cash withdrawals and non-cash payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.
*   **Elite Consensus**: There is an "elite consensus" that this measure is absolutely necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. The timing of its implementation depends on the pace of the economic catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

## Government's Approach and Outlook

The current Russian authorities intend to cope with the impending economic catastrophe using "Old Soviet, even Bolshevik patterns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>:
*   Deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>
*   Food cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>
*   Special distributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>
*   Taking money from the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>

The strategy is to emerge from the crisis at the expense of society and the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

### Inflation Forecasts

Inflation forecasts are severe. While official data for 2022 suggests 30% inflation, unofficial data indicates 9%, meaning prices have almost doubled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. For the coming year, inflation growth is predicted to be from 100% to 200% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## Recommendations for the Population

The crisis is deemed inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>, and while some may feel it's too late or they lack resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>, there are steps individuals can take:

*   **Create Local Mutual Aid Networks**: Agree with others facing similar problems on how to help each other, such as taking turns in lines for social products, reminiscent of the Soviet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.
*   **Support the Elderly**: The crisis, especially regarding food, most severely affects children and the elderly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. It is crucial for middle and younger generations to regularly check on and assist their elderly parents and relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>.

Difficult times are ahead, and while it's believed that the challenges will be overcome, the cost and who pays will be significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.

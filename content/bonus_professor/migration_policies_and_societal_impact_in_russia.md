Reports indicate a rise in crimes committed by migrants in the news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. There is a perception that the [[the_political_climate_in_russia_and_government_policies | current government]] pursues a "toothless policy" toward migrants and "looks at them ingratiatingly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

However, it is stated that this perception is "not entirely true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. The [[the_political_climate_in_russia_and_government_policies | government]] changed its [[the_political_climate_in_russia_and_government_policies | policy]] on migrants after the terrorist attack in Crocus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. While these changes may seem insufficient or not systemic, described as a "company [[the_political_climate_in_russia_and_government_policies | policy]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>, a new [[the_political_climate_in_russia_and_government_policies | policy]] is expected to be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.

## New Migration Policy Initiatives
A key aspect of the new [[the_political_climate_in_russia_and_government_policies | policy]] will be the introduction of a visa regime with several countries, primarily those in Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. This measure is not considered offensive to the dignity of other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. Instead, it is seen as a desire to protect Russia, ensure the safety and health of its citizens, and preserve its way of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>. The speaker asserts confidence that the safety, way of life, honor, and dignity of citizens will be protected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>, and that this task is "not difficult at all" with no "Mafia" being able to stop it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.

## Strategic Turning Point
The withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson and the subsequent arrival of Ukrainian armed forces marked a strategic turning point in the [[military_situation_in_ukraine_and_russias_challenges|military campaign]] between [[russianukrainian_relations_and_military_tensions|Russia and Ukraine]], consolidating a strategic advantage for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This development was confirmed by sensational news that began arriving on the evening of November 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Proposed Peace Deal: Conditions and Implications
On November 10, the Kremlin reportedly received an offer of a peace deal with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This proposal, agreed upon with the Ukrainian leadership, is described as a proposal for the capitulation of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The essence of the proposal includes several key demands and conditions:
*   **Territorial Withdrawal** Russian armed forces are to completely leave Ukraine, including the territories of the DPR and LPR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Crimea Status** The status of Crimea would be suspended for seven years, during which it would not be discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The peninsula would be declared a demilitarized zone, allowing only police and border guards with small arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The Black Sea Fleet is required to leave Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Notably, real estate sales in Crimea had sharply decreased in the months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Demilitarized Border Zone** A 100-kilometer-wide demilitarized strip is to be introduced on the borders of Russia with Ukraine and Belarus, prohibiting heavy weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Guarantor Countries** Six countries have reportedly consented to act as guarantors of this agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Transnistria** Russia must leave Transnistria, including its military base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Transnistria is to be integrated into Moldova in 2023, with Russia undertaking not to interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Ukraine's NATO Stance** Ukraine promises not to join NATO for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Russian Establishment's Reaction
The initial reaction to this "ultimatum" or "offer of capitulation" from the Russian establishment has been positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This is attributed to the proposal guaranteeing freedom and security for the establishment, including security forces, with assurances that criminal cases will not be brought against them or their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The preservation of at least part of their assets is also implied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### President Putin's Reaction and Potential Actions
President Putin's reaction to the proposal is not yet clear; he is currently considering it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Signs indicating his decision include:
*   **Resumption of Missile Attacks** If massive missile attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure, particularly power plants, are resumed, it signifies an unambiguous refusal of the conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Cessation of Shelling** If there is no shelling, it does not necessarily mean acceptance but indicates that reflection continues, and an attempt is being made to gain additional time to comprehend the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Consequences of Decision
If President Putin refuses these conditions, which the Russian establishment is ready to accept, [[military_situation_in_ukraine_and_russias_challenges|military action continues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. A military defeat of the Russian Federation is then considered highly probable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The only way for Putin to delay this inevitable defeat is through a nuclear threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. However, the chances increase that an order to use tactical nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction would be blocked or not carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, which would effectively mean the end of his de facto presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

Regardless of the strategic decision Putin makes, he will likely have to step down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Acceptance of Ultimatum** If Putin accepts the ultimatum, he would likely go into the shadows to save face and shift responsibility to another person to sign the "shameful agreement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This carries the risk of a palace coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Continuation of Campaign** If he decides to continue the military campaign hoping for a miracle, he will inevitably become a "scapegoat" for its defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Historical Parallels
The acceptance of these conditions would signify a sharp turn not only in [[russia_and_ukraine_conflict_dynamics|Russian politics]] but also internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. It would mark a complete and final fiasco for 22 years of Putin's rule, policy, and system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. A historical analogy drawn is the defeat of Russia in the Crimean War (1853-1856), where Emperor Nicholas, initially confident of victory, essentially caused his own death after realizing the reality of defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The situation is developing rapidly, making it both fascinating and terrifying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

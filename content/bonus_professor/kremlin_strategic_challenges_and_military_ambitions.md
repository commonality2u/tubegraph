## Overview of Geopolitical Context

The past week's significant events included the G7 meeting and the NATO summit, which have shaped the current geopolitical landscape vis-à-vis Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:55">[01:21:55]</a>. At these summits, Russia was designated as an enemy of the military alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>. A decision was made to deploy 300,000 rapid deployment forces to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:03">[01:34:03]</a>. Ukraine was promised unlimited aid and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>, and Sweden and Finland were included in NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:33">[01:47:33]</a>. This means a new Cold War situation has been ushered in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:43">[02:08:43]</a>.

During the previous Cold War, the Soviet Union avoided direct clashes in the European theater of military operations, preferring proxy wars in regions like Latin America and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:03">[02:36:03]</a>. However, Ukraine has effectively become "European Africa or Latin America," serving as a field of conflict not just between Russia and Ukraine, but between Russia and NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:03">[03:01:03]</a>. Despite the pressure from Brussels, there is an effort to avoid opening another front on the European continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:33">[04:37:33]</a>.

## [[russian_military_situation_and_challenges_in_ukraine | Russian Military Situation and Challenges in Ukraine]]

On Sunday, July 3rd, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported to President Putin that [[russian_military_strategy_and_challenges | Russian armed forces]] had taken full control of the Luhansk region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:03">[05:06:03]</a>. After four and a half months of fierce armed confrontation, securing only the Luhansk region does not signify a "breakthrough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:63">[05:15:63]</a>. While tactically a success, it is not a strategic coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:03">[05:46:03]</a>. The slowness of the advance of the [[russian_military_strategy_and_challenges | Russian armed forces]] has reduced the political claims of the Kremlin and Putin personally at a public level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:03">[05:51:03]</a>.

### Shifting Military Ambitions

During his visit to Central Asia, Putin stated that the goal of the "special military operation" is to "liberate Donbass and guarantee the security of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:43">[06:02:43]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the initial goals set in February, which included "denazification" and "demilitarization of Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:03">[06:14:03]</a>. The length of the border between NATO and the [[russian_military_strategy_and_challenges | Russian Federation]] has nearly doubled, leading to questions about whether the operation's goals are being minimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:03">[06:34:03]</a>. Despite this, Dmitry Peskov and the Russian president maintain that everything is going as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:03">[06:46:03]</a>.

## Domestic Mobilization and [[russias_economic_challenges_and_strategy | Economic Strategy]]

Regardless of the public lowering of ambitions, the "steamroller" continues to move domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:03">[07:26:03]</a>. Sergey Kiriyenko visited the Kharkov region to discuss its integration into Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:03">[07:30:03]</a>. More significantly, the government has appealed to the State Duma to amend federal law, marking a tangible movement towards a mobilization model for the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:03">[07:41:03]</a>.

The proposed amendments would allow the authorities to introduce special economic measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:03">[08:03:03]</a>. This means firms, organizations, and enterprises, regardless of ownership form, would be prohibited from refusing government orders and contracts related to the [[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_operations | armed actions of the Russian Federation]] outside Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:03">[08:09:03]</a>. Businesses will be obliged to supply goods, perform work, and provide services for military operations abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:03">[08:53:03]</a>. These measures also allow authorities to change contract terms during implementation and interfere with labor relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:03">[09:04:03]</a>. Employees can be forced to work nights, weekends, and holidays, and vacations may be canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:03">[09:32:03]</a>. This situation is very similar to the Soviet Union on the eve of June 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:03">[09:58:03]</a>.

The Kremlin is being drawn into a strategic trap, constantly increasing efforts to overcome the resistance of Ukraine and the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:03">[10:10:03]</a>. This depletion of resources — material, human, and moral — leads to social, technological, and economic degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:03">[10:57:03]</a>.

## [[russias_military_strategy_and_internal_debates | Political Challenges and Internal Control]]

The Kremlin's main concern is not liberal critics broadcasting from outside Russia, but rather "turbo patriots" or "hurray patriots" and super loyalists who criticize the Kremlin from the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:03">[11:33:03]</a>. These critics fault the Kremlin for perceived concessions, such as fighter exchanges and not moving fast enough or being harsh enough in the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:03">[11:54:03]</a>. The FSB has been instructed to thin out the ranks of these zealous right-wing critics, sending a signal that only the Kremlin has the right to determine what is fair, unfair, needed, or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:03">[12:23:03]</a>. Citizens are expected to keep silent and enthusiastically approve all government actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:03">[12:51:03]</a>.

### Repressions

Traditional negative news includes arrests and repressions. Vladimir Mau, the rector of the Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, one of Russia's most influential rectors, has been placed under house arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:37:03">[17:37:03]</a>. His arrest sends a signal to all systemic liberals that their loyalty is worth "absolutely nothing" in the eyes of the Chekists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:03">[18:28:03]</a>.

In the cultural sphere, the Gogol Center has been closed and is reverting to the Gogol Theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:55:03">[18:55:03]</a>. This reflects the government's shift to a mobilization regime, which leads to simplification and the rejection of cultural complexities, regardless of whether they are oppositionist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:03">[19:21:03]</a>.

### [[russias_economic_challenges_and_strategy | Impact on Investors]]

Gazprom's refusal to pay dividends, for the first time since 1998, demonstrates that the state views private investors as "freeloaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:04:03">[20:04:03]</a>. This action signals that nothing belongs to investors, especially as the regime transitions towards a mobilization economy, which will bring restrictions, harshness, simplification, and pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:03">[20:44:03]</a>.

## [[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_strategy | Foreign Policy Adjustments]]

Last week, the president visited Tajikistan and Turkmenistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:03">[13:16:03]</a>. Despite not feeling well, the trip proceeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:03">[13:22:03]</a>. In Turkmenistan, the president was not met at the gangway with flowers or bread, reportedly at the Russian side's request due to the president's fear of physical contact and assassination attempts, which is characteristic paranoia of many dictators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:03">[13:29:03]</a>.

The purpose of the trip to Turkmenistan was related to gas and emphasizing the Caspian Sea's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:03">[14:06:03]</a>. The visit to Tajikistan aimed to improve relations and discuss containing the Taliban, who are receiving five billion dollars from Russia by year-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:03">[14:16:03]</a>.

## [[future_governance_and_geopolitical_strategies_of_russia | Internal Power Dynamics and Succession Probes]]

An extremely important internal political event was the message circulating among Kremlin-linked Telegram channels that Dmitry Nikolaevich Patrushev, the current Minister of Agriculture and son of influential Nikolai Platonovich Patrushev, is the "best candidate for president" as Putin's successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:03">[14:55:03]</a>. There is also discussion about whether Dmitry Patrushev will be appointed Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:03">[15:34:03]</a>. This is interpreted as an accurate "sounding out" of the political class, particularly provincial and middle-level officials, preparing them for a potential change in prime minister and a good presidential candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:03">[16:01:03]</a>. This confirms that serious probes regarding Dmitry Patrushev are underway, influencing the behavior of the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:53:03">[16:53:03]</a>.

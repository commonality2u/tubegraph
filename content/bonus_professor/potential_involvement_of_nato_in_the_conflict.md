Following a massive missile strike by Russia on Ukrainian infrastructure on November 15, 2022, the Kremlin, led by President Putin, is seen as having rejected a peace proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This rejection signals an escalation of [[military_and_strategic_implications_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | military action]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

## Incident in Poland and NATO's Response
A tragic incident occurred in Poland where missiles hit, resulting in the deaths of two Poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. While an investigation is ongoing, it is considered unlikely that this event will become a *casus belli* (an act that provokes war), or lead to [[ukraine_conflict_and_nato_relations | NATO]] activating Article 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Article 5 implies a collective response if one [[ukraine_conflict_and_nato_relations | NATO]] member is attacked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. It is apparent that no one in [[ukraine_conflict_and_nato_relations | NATO]] is interested in this article being invoked at this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## Escalation and Potential NATO Involvement
The escalation of the [[military_and_strategic_implications_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | conflict]] by Russia could lead to the involvement of [[ukraine_conflict_and_nato_relations | NATO]] countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. These countries are actively assisting [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | Ukraine]] and play a significant role in organizing [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | Ukrainian defense]] and offensive operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. The speaker suggests that symmetrical strikes on these [[ukraine_conflict_and_nato_relations | NATO]] countries are not excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.

### Forms of Potential Involvement
Possible actions could include:
*   Cyber attacks, which are considered asymmetrical strikes, a capability Russia possesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.
*   Strikes on logistics hubs, potentially through sabotage, not necessarily only with missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.

The speaker notes that the conflict zone could expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. Russia is not seen as capable of withstanding the pressure from the consolidated West based on its combined power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. Historically, Russia could only succeed by fighting against a part of the West while relying on another part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>.

The [[political_situation_in_Russia | political situation in Russia]] is characterized by an ongoing struggle for power, an increasingly inefficient governance system, and the looming prospect of a leadership transition [01:24:55]. Discussions within the Kremlin elite, external pressures, and public sentiment all contribute to a dynamic and uncertain future for the nation [00:50:42].

## Current Leadership Dynamics

### Vladimir Putin's Health and Public Role
Concerns persist regarding Vladimir Putin's health, which is described as a "very serious problem" that limits his ability to remain in the presidential post and perform public duties [00:07:30]. In January of the current year, he had four and a half times fewer meetings and events compared to January of the previous year [00:07:54]. Major world intelligence agencies reportedly operate with the understanding that the count for his time in power is now in "months," not decades or years [00:08:15]. This assessment indicates that "absolutely nothing has changed" in the gravity of the situation since it was first publicly discussed [00:08:24].

### Succession and Power Transition
The topic of succession is one that Putin has stopped initiating discussions about, specifically since it became known that Alexei Navalny would return to Moscow in December [00:09:09]. Discussions about potential successors resumed only after the FBK (Anti-Corruption Foundation) announced a shift away from active, mass public protests [00:09:42]. An order or request was given to prepare a list of successors, with at least two individuals currently known [00:10:08]. Mishustin is mentioned as one possible successor, with a chance if he becomes a "figure of broad consensus" [00:54:37]. However, once Putin weakens, it is uncertain if Mishustin could maintain his post for long, as others may view his presence as a "personal challenge" or "insult" [00:55:01].

The transfer of power is expected to lead to "confusion and chaos" in [[russian_political_leadership_transitions_and_internal_power_dynamics | Russia]], which are deemed inevitable [00:08:44]. The current dynamics in Russia are predicted to "sweep away all plans" for a controlled transition, leading to an "unimaginable" outcome [00:55:36].

### The Inner Circle and Influential Figures
Putin's inner circle is deeply concerned about sanctions, not because of sanctions against Putin himself, but because sanctions against them could "incite... some kind of plot or stimulate disloyalty" [00:25:52]. This [[russian_political_leadership_transitions_and_internal_power_dynamics | ruling group]] is united in its desire to preserve Putin's system and wants him to remain head of the country for as long as possible, but they are also aware of his limitations and are waiting for him to show initiative regarding succession [00:59:36].

Key influential figures in [[russian_political_system_and_leadership | Russia's political system]] beyond Putin, listed in terms of influence, include:
*   Patrushev [00:58:25]
*   Sechin [00:58:32]
*   Bortnikov [00:58:34]
*   Anton Vaino [00:58:43]
*   Kiriyenko [00:58:49]
*   Kovalchuk [00:58:50]
*   Rotenberg [00:58:57]

Additionally, a group of "consigliere"—little-known, long-standing friends who are consulted in critical situations—also hold influence [00:59:01]. This top layer of the Russian elite consists of approximately "12, perhaps one and a half dozen" individuals [00:59:26].

### Information Leaks and General SVR
Leaks of sensitive information from the Kremlin have "sharply increased in the last two months" [00:27:26]. These leaks are not attributed to top officials but to those in their shadow, who are "thinking about their future" after Putin leaves and how they will justify themselves to the West [00:27:36]. Such leaks have reached an "unprecedented" level, comparable to the Soviet Union after August 1991 [00:28:01].

The Telegram channel "General SVR" is run by several high-ranking officers from Russian special services, both retired and active [00:05:34]. The information provided by "General SVR" is taken seriously by major world intelligence agencies and even read in the Kremlin by almost everyone, including propagandists [01:00:46].

## External Perceptions and Influences

### Western Views and Sanctions
The West holds "very serious concerns" regarding Putin, viewing him as unpredictable, aggressive, and wielding colossal power to damage Western interests [00:50:19]. While they desire a change in [[russian_political_leadership_transitions_and_internal_power_dynamics | Russian leadership]], they do not believe a democrat will come to power [00:52:11]. Instead, they hope for a "predictable, realistic, thinking, understandable person" who will not constantly challenge the West and will focus on Russia's internal problems [00:52:15].

Sanctions against Russia are a major concern for the Kremlin [00:24:25]. While European sanctions are not seen as threatening, the US is feared [00:24:34]. The new Biden administration had prepared several versions of sanctions even before formally taking office, indicating a high determination to "teach a lesson to Russia" or, more precisely, to the Kremlin [00:24:57]. However, Western powers understand that they cannot by themselves provoke a large-scale crisis or change the fate of [[political_dynamics_and_potential_leadership_change_in_russia | Russia]]; such changes can only have "internal causes" [00:26:17].

### China's Influence
China exerts significant influence on [[economic_and_political_situation_in_Russia | Russia]], with Russia acting as a "junior partner" [00:52:58]. Evidence includes the extensive cutting of Siberian taiga for Chinese consumption [00:53:13]. This dependence, while not yet "vassal," could be overcome by establishing good relations with the European Union, the United States, Japan, and South Korea, particularly if Russia focuses on internal development rather than "crazy ambitions" [00:53:26]. There is a "Chinese party" within [[russian_internal_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Russian power]], led by Igor Ivanovich Sechin, which is connected to economic interests and a general orientation towards the Chinese political model [00:56:20]. Chinese entities are also quite successful at corrupting Russian officials [00:56:41].

## Prognosis for Russia's Future

### Inevitable Crisis and Transformation
Russia is predicted to undergo a "severe national crisis," described as a "thunderstorm and a storm," which is seen as the only path to the future given the current government's actions over the past 20 years [01:12:11]. This crisis is not expected to be a civil war [01:12:16]. The current system is considered "inefficient" and "ineffective" in all aspects except maintaining power, making Russia a "degrading country" [01:24:57].

The "revolution" that began at the turn of the 1980s and 1990s is not yet complete [01:24:37]. It will only end when a "more effective, efficient system" emerges [01:24:47]. The 2020s are anticipated to be the decade when this revolution is completed [01:15:11].

### Economic Outlook
The [[economic_and_political_situation_in_Russia | government plans to devalue the ruble]] and even re-denominate it, but this will only be launched if a political decision is made [01:15:03]. Such actions are unlikely before potential early presidential or parliamentary elections [01:15:41].

In the near future, taxes and prices are expected to rise, while the welfare of citizens will decrease [01:18:28]. The current government offers only "survival in increasingly cramped conditions" [01:19:06].

### Social and Political Preparedness
Citizens are advised to prepare for future events by having a supply of cash (not in bank accounts) for two to three months of family expenses [01:16:29]. Establishing "regional connections" and agreements with neighbors on how to help each other in critical situations is deemed "extremely important" [01:17:01].

Despite public fears and a reluctance to express true attitudes, a significant minority already desires and is actively working towards changes [01:45:27]. This minority, numerically small for Russia but representing a "colossal shift," could receive support from another two or three percent of the population, which, combined with a "split of the elites," would lead to inevitable changes [01:46:03]. The demand for change in Russia is "colossal," even higher than during the late Soviet Union, and many people are "ready to sacrifice" for it [01:46:33].

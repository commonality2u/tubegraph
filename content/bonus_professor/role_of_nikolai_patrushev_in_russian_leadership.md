According to Valery Solovey, [[nikolai_patrushevs_role_in_russian_leadership | Nikolai Patrushev]] is currently considered the de facto supreme ruler of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This position is the outcome of a broad compromise and agreement among a wide coalition of elite groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Patrushev's Current Authority and Elite Views

The current agreement recognizing [[nikolai_patrushevs_role_in_russian_leadership | Nikolai Patrushev]]'s authority is understood to be temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The various elite groups forming this coalition are observing how Patrushev conducts business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. They are also keen to see how his son, Dmitry Patrushev, would perform if he becomes Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

The elite is not in a hurry to change the supreme power immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This caution stems from their extensive knowledge of [[nikolai_patrushevs_role_in_russian_leadership | Nikolai Patrushev]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Solovey suggests that if his "best side" is severe, one can only imagine his "worst side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. It is anticipated that these groups might attempt to "replay this game" or agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## The "Transit Scheme" and Control

A "transit scheme" was theoretically agreed upon around late November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This scheme involves significant risks, particularly regarding the use of a "double" for the presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Control over the "Double"
If a "double" is elected president, they would be under the "complete absolute control" of [[nikolai_patrushevs_role_in_russian_leadership | Nikolai Patrushev]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. The double would not be permitted to act independently or "even squeak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Despite a potential increase in perceived freedom, an independent game is unlikely to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The entire entourage of the "president" and major elite groups are aware of this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Mishustin's Limited Power
Prime Minister Mishustin, who would typically become interim head of state after the president's death, lacks significant power to initiate political or systemic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. He would not be able to independently announce the president's death or appoint early elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook for Russia
The situation in Russia is expected to worsen significantly, even more than the COVID-19 pandemic or the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. However, the death of the president is seen as a chance for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Within two to three months, clearer facts and evidence regarding the president's demise and replacement by a "double" are expected to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The political crisis is anticipated to fully manifest and begin to influence the situation early next year, possibly before March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

Positive changes in Russian-Ukrainian relations are unlikely before autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The West's primary interest is maintaining stability in Russia, regardless of the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

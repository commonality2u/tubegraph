From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Leri Solovey, in the 75th episode of his program, describes how he was compelled to rewrite a prepared episode due to a statement made by Peskov, the Secretary of the Russian President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Peskov's statement claimed that a meeting took place on June 29th between Yevgeny Prigozhin, commanders of the Wagner private military company, and President Putin in the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This alleged meeting lasted three hours, occurring in a "good positive atmosphere" and ending "on a positive note" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Solovey characterizes this statement as "elementary brazen lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, emphasizing that there was no such meeting on June 29th or afterward, either collectively or individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The maximum that could have occurred was a telephone conversation between Putin and Prigozhin, though even this is doubted by more substantial sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Solovey identifies three main reasons why the [[role_and_perception_of_russian_leadership_and_power_structures | leadership of Russia]] and Peskov, who belongs to the highest Russian elite, would engage in such blatant deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>:

## Reasons for Spreading Misinformation

### 1. Maintaining Putin's Reputation
The primary reason is to bolster Putin's reputation, showing him as a "wise Leader" in complete control of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The alleged meeting with Prigozhin and Wagner fighters is presented as a "cleverly conceived game" or "Putin's multi-move," intended to restore his reputation, which "suffered catastrophically" after the Wagner mutiny in the eyes of the elite, the deep state, and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### 2. Portraying Putin as Physically Capable and Present
The second reason, linked to the first, is to convey that Putin is in control, capable, and healthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Solovey asserts that recent public appearances and actions attributed to Putin are "pure hoaxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, as the actual president "is physically unable to do this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

#### The Use of Doubles
Solovey claims that the president is "constantly replaced by a double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, often two different ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. He states that the existence of a double is not doubted by "any representative of the Russian elite" or any "self-respecting intelligence service of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, with skepticism only remaining among the mass society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

> "We see under the general name of the President of Russia three different people." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>

This claim is supported by a phonoscopic and anthropological examination allegedly conducted in one of the G7 countries, where multiple independent experts concluded that "three different people" operate under the general name of the President of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This [[russian_political_commentary_and_conspiracy_theories | narrative about doubles]] contributes to the [[media_manipulation_and_political_narratives_in_russia | formation of a global agenda]] to delegitimize the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

Solovey further asserts that Putin's physical condition is deteriorating, claiming he is "blind already in his left eye" due to metastasis, citing a reliable source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Trips to regions and abroad are also undertaken by a double, which is considered an "extremely risky undertaking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. The actual Putin is described as an "inactive president" currently in "storage in a deep bunker" from which he does not emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

### 3. Masking International Humiliation
The third reason for the deception is to cover up Putin's humiliation on the international stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Solovey points to Turkish President Erdogan's actions, such as transferring Azov fighters to Ukraine, supporting Ukraine's NATO accession, and promising intensive military aid and drone factory construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The Kremlin and Putin have remained silent on these matters because "Russia is critically dependent on the so-called parallel import that passes through Turkey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, granting Erdogan significant leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

Another "invisible act of humiliation" involves the Kremlin's recent attempts to secure a telephone conversation with French President Macron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Previously, Macron sought conversations with Putin, with hundreds of hours spent on the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Now, Putin wishes to speak with Macron, but the French president is refusing or giving "no immediate response" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This highlights the [[western_pressure_on_russian_elites | decline in Putin's geopolitical standing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## Media Tactics and [[State Propaganda and Media Influence in Russia | Propaganda]]
The Russian official media, particularly main TV channels, engaged in efforts to compromise Prigozhin after the failed military attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. They published information portraying him as an oligarch living a luxurious lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Solovey argues this was an ineffective [[impact_of_propaganda_and_media_sources_in_russia | PR campaign]] for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>:
*   **No negative PR (except an obituary):** Any attention, even negative, keeps a figure "afloat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **Societal immunity to exposure:** Russian society has become immune to "exposures," partly due to Navalny's team repeatedly publishing evidence without leading to political dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Many citizens now view such wealth and behavior as "the norm" for those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.
*   **Shift in information consumption:** The politically active and interested part of society no longer relies on central television channels for information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Key political events and calls, such as Prigozhin's rebellion, are primarily distributed via Telegram channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

## Outlook
Solovey concludes that Prigozhin's rebellion acted as an "icebreaker that split the ice surrounding Putin's regime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>, opening up a "free space" for other forces and potentially leading to significant events like a coup d'Ã©tat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. This crisis, which is already underway, presents a "unique opportunity" for citizens to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. He encourages viewers to join his Telegram channel for "necessary operational information" on what action to take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>, emphasizing the importance of staying in touch for civic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. He views financial support for his platform as a form of [[public_opinion_and_its_impact_on_russian_political_dynamics | civic activity]] contributing to the "liberation of our Motherland" and building a better future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

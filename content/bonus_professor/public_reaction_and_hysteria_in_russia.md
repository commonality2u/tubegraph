Russia is described as moving "quite quickly, confidently in the direction of introducing full or partial martial law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This movement follows a series of incidents and has led to a palpable shift in public sentiment.

## Context: Recent Attacks and Incidents

On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, May 3rd, the Moscow Kremlin was attacked by drones of unknown origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. While the origin is believed to be 99.99% Ukrainian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, the Kremlin's quick public recognition of this fact is seen as an admission that "things are not going very well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The attack was symbolic, intended to show that the Kremlin is vulnerable and that the Russian flag has fallen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, especially on the eve of a Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Prior to the Kremlin attack, other incidents of a military nature had occurred:
*   Sabotage on railway transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   An FSB announcement of a prevented assassination attempt on the head of the Republic of Crimea, Aksyonov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   Drones regularly attacking not only frontline areas but increasingly Moscow and the Moscow region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## The Growing Atmosphere of Tension and Hysteria

These events have contributed to an "intensive and increasingly tense hysterical atmosphere" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This tension is characteristic of the Russian establishment across all echelons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

> "Hysteria it covers some mentally unstable layers of Russian society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Public Response and "Drone Mania"

In Moscow and the Moscow region, there has been a "whole mania for searching and detecting Ukrainian drones" since April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. On one day, up to 100 calls were received from eyewitnesses reporting drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. The overwhelming majority of these calls are considered "absolute nonsense" and are dictated by the fears of those reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

This [[impact_of_the_conflict_on_russian_society | societal change]] and widespread character of the "drone mania" led Moscow authorities to order public utilities to monitor the airspace of the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This order points to strong nervousness and tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Official Reactions and Restrictions

On May 3rd, the Moscow mayor banned all drone launches except for competent authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This aligns with the broader [[propaganda_and_public_sentiment_in_russia | informational and moral-psychological offensive]] already underway, creating an "atmosphere of anxious expectation and expectation of something bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Security Council Secretary Patrushev demanded the president immediately impose [[potential_mobilization_and_public_dissent_in_russia | martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. While martial law is already in effect in the so-called "new territories," its extension to the capital and frontline regions was discussed, but Putin postponed the decision until the end of the week, likely not deciding anything before May 9th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Putin is understood to be in no hurry, as introducing martial law would diminish his power in favor of the security officers who would control it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## Implications of Potential Martial Law on Citizens

Martial law inherently means a set of restrictions, primarily on civil rights and freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. For those subject to military service, this would be particularly impactful, potentially including a ban on travel outside the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Currently, over 15 million people are in the database of those potentially subject to [[potential_mobilization_and_public_dissent_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

Other potential restrictions include:
*   Restrictions on movement between regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   Strengthening passport control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   Restriction of freedom of speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   The possibility of internment, meaning detention without trial or investigation for up to 30 days, extendable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   Easier conscription, with formal restrictions likely ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

There are already reports, awaiting confirmation from Telegram channels, of mass checks in cities, not only of those subject to conscription but also military service members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. There are also reports of escorts of young and not-so-young people to military registration and enlistment offices for document verification and recruitment efforts using persuasion, blackmail, or threats of violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. An instance in Moscow saw police track a young man to Sberbank via video cameras to conduct a military registration and enlistment office check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

### Economic and Societal Impact

Theoretically, bank cards and accounts of those potentially liable for military service or [[potential_mobilization_and_public_dissent_in_russia | mobilization]] could be blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The Central Bank reportedly moved towards this in September of the previous year, and the financial and banking system is now ready for such measures, despite financial authorities not being delighted by the prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

The implementation of martial law measures, or elements of it without formal introduction, will largely depend on local authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Moscow Mayor Sobyanin is expected to try and protect his voters and maintain their loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

Despite the potentially depressing impression of these developments, the speaker believes that events are moving in the "right direction" toward "liberation," "justice," and a "different quality life" for the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The speaker encourages financial and moral support for this cause, framing it as an investment in a renewed Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

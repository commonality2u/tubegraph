## Overview of the Domestic Environment
The internal [[political_situation_in_russia | political situation in Russia]] is characterized by a sobering assessment of the "special military operation" and a pervasive anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. Mass events related to May 1st and May 9th have been cancelled in front-line regions adjacent to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Even in the deep rear, including Moscow, parades have been cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>, with Red Square closed for quarantine in preparation for the parade, and the air part of the parade cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. The presence of Russian Guard patrols in public places in Moscow is notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. The Russian military reportedly holds the "gloomiest expectations" regarding the upcoming Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

### Military Personnel and Recruitment
The Russian army is described as having "lost its offensive potential a long time ago" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, with a current "shortage of personnel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
*   **Contract Soldiers Campaign**
    *   An advertising campaign aims to recruit between 400,000 and 500,000 contract soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.
    *   This campaign is reportedly "not going in the best way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.
*   **Potential Mobilization**
    *   Discussions about mobilization will occur if the contract recruitment effort fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.
    *   In St. Petersburg, summonses are being delivered to conscripts and recruits, threatening restrictive measures if they do not appear at military enlistment offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.
*   **Prisoner Recruitment**
    *   Intensive recruitment of prisoners is ongoing, initially by the Wagner PMC, and now by the Ministry of Defense and private military companies like Redut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. This intensification has occurred in recent weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.
*   **Ammunition Shortages**
    *   Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Wagner, has publicly stated there is a "shortage of ammunition" on the front line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

### Perceptions of the President
The "key problem of Russia" is identified as residing at "Moscow, the Kremlin, President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.
*   **Public and Elite Perception**
    *   The Russian public no longer perceives the president as a source of well-being, but rather as a "key problem, a key threat, and as a toxic asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.
    *   His status causes "a lot of tension in the establishment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.
*   **Health and Public Appearances**
    *   The president's health is described as "extremely bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a> and "not so hot," despite intensive treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.
    *   Last week, the president did not appear at public events; instead, his "double showed up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.
    *   His double also attended the opening of the Turkish nuclear power plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.
    *   It is "not a fact" that the Russian President will be at the May 9th parade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>, due to health concerns and security risks from Ukrainian drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.
*   **Discourse on Doubles**
    *   The discussion of the president's doubles is intensifying both outside and within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>, appearing in both tabloids and serious media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.
    *   Dmitry Peskov, the presidential press secretary, was "forced to react" indirectly to these rumors, claiming the president has "such wonderful health" and is "hyperactive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.
    *   Despite Peskov's statements, the president reportedly "works with documents...in a bunker" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:00:00">[12:00:00]</a> and conducts meetings from there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
    *   The idea of presidential doubles has become a "media reality" and a "reality of public opinion," which will affect people's behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>.
    *   The upper echelons of Russian society prefer not to participate in events where a double appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

### Policy and Repercussions
The authorities' response to the current challenges is described as "tightening internal repressions against those whom they consider the fifth column, traitors of the Motherland, dangerous subjects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>. This policy is characterized as dangerous and "very painful for those who retain a civil temperament" and dare to express their opinion in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:39:00">[19:39:00]</a>.

## Key Events and Developments
*   **Bakhmut Situation:** The Russian armed forces have not yet taken Bakhmut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. Yevgeny Prigozhin's interview indicates the situation on the front is "far from brilliant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
*   **Ukrainian Offensive:** Russia is frozen in anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>, which will truly be an "offensive" because the Russian army has lost its offensive potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Drone Attacks:** Ukrainian drones are "scurrying back and forth" and appearing in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>, leading to Moscow finding itself in a state of "elements of a siege or semi-siege" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. A "successful bombing by a Ukrainian drone" occurred recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
*   **Crimea Outlook:** Russian General Staff officers are taking seriously the prospect of fighting on the territory of Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. The possibility of Ukraine reaching the border with Crimea and using missiles to cover the Kerch bridge is considered real, which could turn Crimea into an island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Elite Discontent:** Conversations between billionaire Roman Trotsenko and businessman Nikolai Matushevsky reveal "vivid characteristics" of discontent within Russian business regarding the president and the prospects of current government policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.
*   **Prigozhin's Statements:** Yevgeny Prigozhin's recent interview expressed "very frankly" concerns regarding the state of affairs on the fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. His statements indicate that fears of a Ukrainian offensive's success are "very great," and he seeks to warn the public that in case of failure, he will not be to blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>. He behaves "brazenly" because he "feels very well that the situation has gone to hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>.

**Conclusion:** The situation in Russia is characterized by military setbacks, internal resource shortages, growing public and elite discontent with the leadership, and an increase in domestic repression. However, it is stated that despite all challenges, the situation is "developing in the right direction" and "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a>.

The future of Russia's governance and social systems is projected to undergo significant changes, moving away from current trajectories and potentially implementing various reforms across political, social, and economic spheres.

## Political and Constitutional Reforms
A new Russian Republic is envisioned, which would involve a constituent assembly or constitutional conference establishing a new constitution and considering changes to the national symbols, such as the coat of arms [00:09:36]. This body is expected to establish a new Russian Constitution [00:09:43].

Regarding [[future_leadership_and_governance_in_russia | future leadership and governance in Russia]], it is predicted that the next president of Russia will not be any of the currently discussed candidates from the government or opposition [00:36:05]. Instead, a "completely different person" is expected to assume the presidency after Putin [00:36:13]. The speaker believes that groups close to the Russian president will prioritize their survival after Putin, potentially breaking existing loyalties [00:29:33].

A key aspect of [[future political changes in Russia | future political changes in Russia]] is the expectation that new political forces will emerge and direct Russia towards dialogue and interaction with the West [00:29:54]. These forces are anticipated to have sufficient strength to resist China's influence, especially with support from Western nations like the United States, Japan, and South Korea, which are interested in preventing Russia from becoming too reliant on China [00:29:59].

## Social and Justice Reforms
One proposed social reform involves the burial of Vladimir Lenin and other statesmen currently interred in the Kremlin wall at a single cemetery [00:09:48]. It is suggested that Lenin's burial should occur with state honors, aiming to conclude this historical chapter [00:10:05].

A significant reform concerns the judiciary, with a call for full lustration [00:28:25]. This is deemed "absolutely necessary" [00:28:21]. Beyond the judiciary, broader lustration, or a period similar to 1985-1999 (but in a positive sense), is anticipated [00:28:47]. Individuals who have committed crimes will face legal action under the Criminal Code, rather than lustration measures [00:28:35].

## Economic and Social Welfare Reforms
Concerning [[economic challenges and reforms in Russia | economic challenges and reforms in Russia]], a specific proposal exists for pension reform in a new Russia [00:20:00]. This reform would involve:
*   Rolling back the retirement age to its previous indicator before the so-called pension reform [00:20:18].
*   Establishing a special pension account for each citizen [00:20:04].
*   Mandating the state to pay out all or most of a person's pension savings to their relatives if the individual does not live to retirement age [00:20:09].

## Regional Governance and Federalism
Russia is currently a Federation by name but not de facto [00:32:42]. There is a plan to transform Russia into an actual federation, where regions (regardless of being called republics or territories) receive more freedoms [00:32:37]. The starting point for this change should be the expansion of financial and economic powers for the regions [00:32:50]. This would ensure that Russian-majority regions have the same rights, opportunities, and powers as the Republics within the Russian Federation [00:33:04]. The principle is that "all animals should be equal" [00:33:25], meaning republics should not have more powers than other regions [00:33:18].

## International Relations and Post-Conflict Policies
After the cessation of armed conflict, [[future governance and geopolitical strategies of Russia | future governance and geopolitical strategies of Russia]] will involve the restoration of economic ties with the West [00:35:35]. This includes the restoration of contacts between scientists and cultural ties [00:35:39]. While this process will take time, it is expected to happen within years, not decades, as both Russia and its Western partners (Europe, North America, Japan) are interested in such restoration [00:35:43].

Regarding Ukraine, a future Russian political force vows not to pursue a policy similar to Putin's [00:11:52]. The goal for Russia will be solely focused on its own internal affairs [00:12:00], avoiding intervention or imposing "brotherly love" on neighbors [00:12:12]. This stance includes not reviving claims about "original Russian lands" or "offended Russian speakers," which could lead to further armed confrontation [00:12:30]. The status of Donbass and Crimea will be determined by future peace negotiations [00:13:08].

## Internal Challenges and Opposition
The current government is described as intensifying repressions against those who disagree and even those who agree but express independent opinions publicly [00:31:26]. This is unrelated to the International Criminal Court's warrant but is a general demand by Putin [00:31:39]. Surveillance and control over Russian elites, particularly oligarchs, are expected to be strengthened due to the warrant [00:31:45].

The Russian Academy of Sciences is described as a degrading system, and its future form and functions require a clear reform idea [00:37:27].

The Russian political opposition, particularly among émigrés, is seeing some association, mainly within the liberal-democratic wing [00:16:55]. However, Navalny's team remains separate due to its perceived leadership position [00:17:05]. Within Russia, consolidation of political opposition is difficult due to outright bans on political and civic activity [00:17:43]. Nevertheless, an [[sociopolitical_changes_and_reforms_in_russia | anti-regime coalition]] is considered highly probable in the long term, potentially including democrats, leftists, and Russian nationalists, similar to the "Democratic Russia" movement of the late 1980s and early 1990s [00:18:02].

The speaker expresses confidence that current negative trends, such as Russia becoming a vassal of China, will be reversed once new forces come to power [00:05:50]. He asserts that Russia will experience a "better, free, fair, and prosperous" future for its citizens [00:41:00].

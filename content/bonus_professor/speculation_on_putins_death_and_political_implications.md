## Allegations of Vladimir Putin's Death
A study by the Lansing Institute, a small American institute, collected indirect evidence supporting the claim of [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death | Vladimir Putin's alleged death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. This study's presentation and a Russian translation are available on a specific Telegram channel, which the speaker recommends reviewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. The speaker asserts that since October 26, many American publications, both independent and dependent, have addressed this topic, albeit with a question mark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

The speaker confidently states that he knows for certain that [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death | Putin is not alive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. He maintains that over time, this will become evident to everyone, with the exception of those who might believe alternative theories about Putin's disappearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. While cancer was widely discussed as the cause of death, the speaker confirms that Putin ultimately died from cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

## Succession and Political Future
Following [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death | Putin's death]], "Vasilyevich," identified as [[speculations_around_putin_and_doubles | Putin's double]], is currently acting president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. This individual is integral to the plans of [[potential_political_consequences_for_putin_and_russian_establishment | Nikolai Patrushev]], who is described as the "supreme ruler of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. Patrushev is actively discussing and promoting the option of transferring power to his son, with "Vasilyevich" facilitating this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. However, "Vasilyevich" himself is reportedly wary of this arrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that [[putins_control_and_health_speculations | Putin's era is over]] and a new historical era is beginning in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. This transition is not yet widely noticeable but is underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:00">[24:28:00]</a>.

### Nikolai Patrushev's Role
[[potential_political_consequences_for_putin_and_russian_establishment | Nikolai Patrushev]] is a key figure in the new government, alongside the group that supports him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. Patrushev is believed to be largely responsible for the persecution of Alexei Navalny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>.

### Dmitry Patrushev's Potential Presidency
Dmitry Patrushev, Nikolai's son, is young and belongs to a new generation accustomed to luxury and enjoyment under the shadow of influential parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:54:00">[15:54:00]</a>. While Dmitry is described as not evil, which the speaker sees as an advantage for modern Russia, there are doubts about his ability to become an effective manager of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. To effectively manage Russia, the foundations of the Putin system would need to be destroyed and replaced, and it is uncertain if Dmitry Patrushev is capable of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>.

### Future President of Russia
A parliamentary republic is not expected to be established in Russia, at least not during the transitional period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. A referendum on moving to a parliamentary system or remaining a presidential republic might be held after ten to twelve years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:54:00">[14:54:00]</a>. The speaker has a personal favorite for future president but declines to name them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. The most important qualities for a future president are identified as love for the Motherland and its people, and common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:15:00">[15:15:00]</a>.

## Broader Political Implications
The political crisis in Russia will begin with a crisis of the Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:13:00">[28:13:00]</a>. The speaker suggests that the [[impact_of_putins_death_on_russian_regions_and_politics | death of Putin]] marks the beginning of the most significant changes for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:17:00">[35:17:00]</a>. The ultimate goals are freedom and justice for Russia, with law and justice for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:34:00">[35:34:00]</a>.

### Potential Civil War and Collapse
There is a discussion regarding the likelihood of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov's march on Moscow, which could trigger a civil war and the collapse of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>. While life in Russia suggests almost anything is possible, the speaker considers the probability of this specific scenario to be insignificant, though not entirely rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.

### Nuclear War Probability
The probability of a nuclear war is linked to Patrushev's perception of threats to his power from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. If he feels such a threat, he might consider using nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:00">[17:45:00]</a>.

### Economic and Social Changes
The speaker predicts significant changes in the financial and monetary spheres as a side effect of the impending crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07:00">[28:07:00]</a>. A denomination (total replacement of banknotes) is planned, likely in the fall of next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:53:00">[27:53:00]</a>.

### Public Awareness and Propaganda
The speaker attributes public belief in state television narratives to a powerful propaganda machine that eliminates alternative viewpoints and influential opposition media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:17:00">[18:17:00]</a>. Messages from authorities are constantly repeated, leading to "stupefaction and debilization" of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>. This effect could be reversed within months if the propaganda machine is dismantled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>.

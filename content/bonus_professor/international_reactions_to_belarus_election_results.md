Following the presidential elections in [[political_unrest_and_revolution_in_belarus | Belarus]], widespread protests erupted, and many international actors reacted to the results.

## Non-Recognition of Election Results

The 2020 presidential elections in [[political_unrest_and_revolution_in_belarus | Belarus]] have not been recognized by numerous European countries, including Ukraine, which officially withheld congratulations to [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] on his declared victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Russia's Stance and Proposed Compromise

The situation in [[political_unrest_and_revolution_in_belarus | Belarus]] remains highly uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The current events suggest that the Belarusian revolution has reached an impasse, with the impulse of Belarusians alone not being sufficient to overthrow [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

A potential compromise formula was discussed during telephone conversations between [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] and [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This formula entails [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] remaining president for no more than a year, after which he would announce early presidential elections following the adoption of a new constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. During this period, he would also need to sign a new union treaty with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Under this plan, [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] would not run in the early elections, and Babarika would become a leading candidate, seen by Moscow as a candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This arrangement aims to provide [[political_unrest_and_revolution_in_belarus | Belarus]] with a new, non-authoritarian president, while Russia addresses its control over [[political_unrest_and_revolution_in_belarus | Belarus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] would then move to Moscow to become secretary of the new State Council body being created in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Should there be very strong pressure on [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]], an option for earlier elections exists, potentially even within the current year, but with the same proposed outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]]'s statement about Russia preparing reserves to assist [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] is intended to compel the Belarusian opposition and society to negotiate this compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Russian Military Reserves
[[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] confirmed in an interview that Russia has prepared reserves at [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]]'s request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. However, this is seen as a warning or rhetorical figure, as neither [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] nor [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] desires the actual use of force, which would significantly damage relations between Russians and Belarusians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] also informed Merkel (before the Navalny poisoning incident) that Russia had no intention of introducing armed forces into [[political_unrest_and_revolution_in_belarus | Belarus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. The "reserve" refers to the so-called Cross Guard and OMON forces, with approximately 200-300 Rosgvardia and OMON personnel, including former Ukrainian Berkut fighters, currently present in [[political_unrest_and_revolution_in_belarus | Belarus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Allegations of External Factors
[[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] has claimed that an external factor is influencing the rallies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. While an external factor exists, it is not of primary importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. A group of consultants, primarily American political technologists based in Warsaw, are attempting to assist the opposition, but their role is not decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. It is inaccurate to describe the protests as a revolution provoked from the outside, similar to how it was inaccurate to describe Ukraine's "Revolution of Dignity" as being solely American-provoked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The European Union, for instance, had sought a compromise with Yanukovych in February 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Although external intervention is present, it is not the key driver of events; the Russian Federation holds the most significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Future of Belarusian Independence
If [[political_unrest_and_revolution_in_belarus | Belarus]] signs the union treaty being discussed, it would effectively transform into a "western province of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. [[political_unrest_and_revolution_in_belarus | Belarus]] would cede 95% of its national powers to the union state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## Impact on Donbass Negotiations
While Minsk has traditionally served as the main negotiating platform for Donbass, there is currently no discussion of changing this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. The Russian delegation might be strengthened with Vladislav Surkov potentially returning to the Ukrainian policy direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. In extreme cases, negotiations could be moved to Almaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Despite previous dissatisfaction with Surkov's performance, as the Ukrainian side refused to comply with prior agreements, his return may be necessary to intensify the stalled negotiating process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The Kremlin remains confident in its ability to influence Yermak and his deputy regarding the Normandy format meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## Outlook on Regional Relations
The decisive factor shaping relations between Russia, Ukraine, and [[political_unrest_and_revolution_in_belarus | Belarus]] will be a future powerful and radical [[impact_on_russian_opposition | political crisis]] in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This crisis is expected to change the mode of relations with its neighbors, particularly Ukraine and [[political_unrest_and_revolution_in_belarus | Belarus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Russia will likely be preoccupied with internal issues as [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] is expected to leave power, leading to new leadership, a new agenda, and a new style in international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

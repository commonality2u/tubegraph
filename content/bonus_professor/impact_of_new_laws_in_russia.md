The speaker notes that new legislation in Russia is significantly impacting various aspects of public life and individual freedoms.

## Increased Disclaimers and Information Control

As of December 1, new laws have come into force that mandate longer disclaimers on video materials. The speaker observes that his YouTube channel now includes a new disclaimer stating that the content is intended for people over 18 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09">[02:09]</a>. He humorously suggests that if [[current_and_potential_future_restrictions_in_russia | laws continue to develop]] in this way, disclaimers might eventually take up several minutes of a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19">[02:19]</a>.

> [!INFO] Personal Impact of "Agent" Law
> The speaker mentions that the new law on "agents," which also came into force on December 1, prevents him from working in his specialty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:14">[30:14]</a>. He states he has no chance to work and is deprived of a number of rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19">[30:19]</a>.

## Potential Future Restrictions and Control

Additional information suggests that the second stage of mobilization could be linked to the extension of martial law to large Russian cities, or potentially the entire territory of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32">[11:32]</a>. This would entail significant [[current_and_potential_future_restrictions_in_russia | additional restrictions]].

Proposed measures include:
*   **Total Control via QR Codes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20">[12:20]</a>: The president is allegedly informed that it is technically possible to implement almost complete control over the population through QR codes by January-February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54">[11:54]</a>.
*   **Differentiated Travel Restrictions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05">[12:05]</a>:
    *   The largest group (over 70-80% of the population) would be prohibited from leaving their subject of the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31">[12:31]</a>.
    *   A second group would have somewhat expanded travel abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:41">[12:41]</a>.
    *   A third, smallest group (trusted people, including security forces) would be allowed to move throughout the Russian Federation, but not leave the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47">[12:47]</a>.
*   **Special Permits for International Travel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21">[13:21]</a>: It is assumed that to go abroad, a special permit would be required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24">[13:24]</a>.
*   **Curfew** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56">[13:56]</a>: The introduction of a curfew is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56">[13:56]</a>.
*   **Internment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59">[13:59]</a>: This refers to the possibility of being detained for 30 days without trial or investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00">[14:00]</a>. A special detention center in Sakharov, near Moscow, is reportedly intended for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06">[14:06]</a>.
*   **Card Blocking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26">[15:26]</a>: It is proposed to introduce blocking of bank cards for those in the database of mobilized people or those potentially subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29">[15:29]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Doubts on Implementation
> The speaker expresses serious doubts that these far-reaching plans will be fully realized due to Russia's "Aryan organization and American businesslike efficiency" and inherent disorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22">[14:22]</a>. He believes it will quickly devolve into chaos and growing discontent, which may influence the leadership's decision on maintaining martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34">[14:34]</a>. The speaker concludes that "nothing good awaits us, only bad things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18">[15:18]</a>.

## Unlikely Restrictions on Online Content Consumption

The speaker states that law enforcement officers are unlikely to conduct checks of Muscovites' subscriptions to "unpatriotic" YouTube channels or communication with "agents" because there would not be enough resources for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28">[21:28]</a>. However, he considers it possible that YouTube could be entirely closed down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03">[22:03]</a>. He advises against checking phones at border crossings for "questionable materials" when going abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:16">[22:16]</a>.

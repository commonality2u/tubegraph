Speculation and analysis regarding [[Vladimir Putin's health and political future | Vladimir Putin's]] health and the future of Russian leadership are recurring topics of discussion.

## Health Concerns
There are claims of a "very serious problem" limiting [[Health and leadership concerns of Vladimir Putin | Vladimir Putin's]] ability to remain in the presidential post and perform public duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Despite perceptions of him looking well, the speaker advises checking official chronicles. In January of the current year, [[Vladimir Putin | Vladimir Putin]] reportedly had 4.5 times fewer official meetings and events than in January of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This assessment comes from major world intelligence services, who are reportedly counting [[Putins Control and Health Speculations | Vladimir Putin's]] remaining time in office in months, not years or decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## Transition of Power
The topic of a power transfer, or "transit," within Russia is seen as inevitable, leading to confusion and chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. [[Vladimir Putin | Vladimir Putin]] reportedly stopped initiating discussions about his successor after it became known that Alexei Navalny would return to Moscow in December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. However, discussions about a successor resumed after the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) announced it was abandoning active and mass public protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. An order or request was then given to prepare a list of successors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. As of the time of the broadcast, two potential successors were known, with more information expected by the end of February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

### Potential Successors
One mentioned potential successor is Mishustin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:37">[00:54:37]</a>. While he currently has partial consensus around him, his long-term position is uncertain once [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] weakens, as others may see his presence as a personal challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>. The speaker believes that the current dynamics in Russia will "sweep away all plans" for a smooth transfer of power, leading to an "unimaginable" future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>.

### Role of Doubles
It is believed that [[Putins Control and Health Speculations | Vladimir Putin's]] doubles, used for security and some public events, would have an "extremely short-lived" role if the president becomes incapacitated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

## International Perspectives on Putin's Future
Western concerns regarding [[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] stem from his perceived unpredictability, aggression, and use of "colossal power" to cause damage to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:15">[00:50:15]</a>. Therefore, they desire a change in the Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>. However, Western powers understand that a large-scale crisis in Russia can only have internal causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>. They would prefer a predictable, realistic, and understandable leader focused on Russia's internal problems, rather than one who constantly challenges the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>. They do not expect a democrat to come to power in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:11">[00:52:11]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics and Elite Split
The speaker notes that sensitive information leaks from the Kremlin have "sharply increased" in the last two months, reaching an "unprecedented" level compared to the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. This is attributed to individuals in the "shadow" of top officials who are thinking about their future after [[Vladimir Putin | Vladimir]] leaves office and seeking security guarantees from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

[[Vladimir Putin | Putin]] is reportedly less concerned about sanctions against himself and more worried that sanctions against his inner circle could incite plots or disloyalty among his entourage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>. The top Russian elite, numbering about 12 to 18 people, are united in preserving [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin's system]] and desire his continued leadership, but are awaiting his initiative on the succession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>. An elite split is anticipated if strong pressure from below (protests) is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.

The speaker believes that [[Vladimir Putins leadership and opposition forces | Vladimir Putin]] views Russia as his personal property, similar to a dacha, and loves it as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. His strength is perceived to lie in the "stupidity" and "disunity" of the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>.

## Future Outlook
A "severe national crisis" is predicted for Russia, similar to the late Soviet period, as the country transitions to a new phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>. The speaker expresses belief that Russia can be transformed into a country of "decent life" and achieve a "Russian miracle" through freedom, stability, and internal development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:38">[01:17:38]</a>. The speaker also believes that the revolution that began at the turn of the 1980s-1990s in Russia has not yet ended, and will be completed in the 2020s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:37">[01:24:37]</a>.

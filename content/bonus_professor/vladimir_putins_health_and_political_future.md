Reports and observations suggest that [[putins_health_and_its_influence_on_russian_politics | Vladimir Putin's health]] presents a "very serious problem," as it reportedly limits his ability to remain in the presidential post and perform public duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This information, corroborated by major world intelligence agencies, indicates that the timeframe for assessing his activity is now measured in months, not decades or years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. An analysis of the official chronicle reveals that in January of the current year, Putin had four and a half times fewer meetings and events compared to January of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Political Implications and Succession

[[putins_political_challenges_and_potential_leadership_changes | Putin's political challenges and potential leadership changes]] are closely tied to his health. Discussions regarding succession ceased when Alexei Navalny's return to Moscow became known in December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Navalny was expected to return between January 5th and 10th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Putin reportedly resumed talks about succession only after the Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) announced it was abandoning active and mass public protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. An order was subsequently issued to prepare a list of successors, with two individuals currently known as potential candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Sanctions and Disloyalty Fears

The Kremlin is not concerned about sanctions from Europe, believing them incapable of posing a real threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. However, they express significant apprehension regarding sanctions from the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. The Biden administration, even before taking office, had prepared several versions of sanctions. While not immediately implemented, the U.S. is highly determined to "teach a lesson" to Russia, or more precisely, the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

Putin is reportedly not afraid of sanctions against himself, but fears that sanctions targeting his inner circle could incite a plot or stimulate disloyalty among his confidantes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. Western powers recognize that they cannot, by themselves, provoke a large-scale crisis in Russia that would lead to a change in power; such a crisis must originate from internal causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>. They believe that a serious internal crisis could potentially stimulate further actions.

## Increased Information Leaks

In the past two months, leaks of sensitive information from the Kremlin have sharply increased, reaching an unprecedented level compared to the last 20 years, possibly comparable to the period after August 1991 in the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:26]</a>. These leaks are attributed to individuals in the "shadow" of top officials who are considering their future after Putin leaves power and how they will justify themselves and negotiate with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. They are reportedly seeking security guarantees from Western nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>.

## Prognosis for Putin's Presidency

Based on information from well-informed institutions, the speaker believes that [[possibility_of_putins_death_and_its_implications | Vladimir Putin]] will not remain president next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:23">[01:14:23]</a>. The prevailing dynamics in Russia are expected to "sweep away" current plans for power transfer, leading to an unpredictable outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:36">[00:55:36]</a>.

As the conflict in Ukraine escalated and passed its 100-day mark, Western participants providing assistance to Ukraine began holding consultations on a potential [[potential_peace_proposals_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace formula]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. These consultations primarily involve the United States, Great Britain, and the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Consultations Without Ukraine
CNN reported that these consultations have been ongoing for the past one and a half to two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Significantly, these discussions have been conducted *without* the participation of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This is despite earlier promises from the West that no issues concerning Ukraine would be resolved without Ukraine's involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The speaker notes that these are currently discussions, not a final resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## The Italian Peace Formula
The West is reportedly considering the Italian formula as a basis for [[potential_peace_proposals_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace talks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This formula includes several key points:
*   Ukraine declares itself a neutral, non-bloc state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   Crimea and Donbass receive full autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   Russian troops are withdrawn to their positions as of the morning of February 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   Large-scale [[negotiations_and_peace_talks_in_kyiv | negotiations]] are to begin concerning Crimea and Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Unsuitability of the Formula
The speaker suggests that this formula would not be acceptable to either the Russian Federation or Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

#### For Russia
Russia currently controls significant territories, including almost all of the Kherson region, most of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, and a considerable part of the Zaporozhye region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. It is unlikely that [[kremlins_view_on_peace_with_ukraine | Russia would agree to abandon these "new territories"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. On the contrary, steps are being taken to integrate these areas into the Russian Federation, such as issuing Russian passports, introducing Russian mobile operators, and making the ruble an official currency in places like the Kherson region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

#### For Ukraine
It is difficult to imagine Ukraine accepting such conditions, especially after the sacrifices it has made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Pressure on Ukraine
Despite the unsuitability, Ukraine could potentially be forced to agree to a [[peace_negotiations_with_ukraine | peace agreement]] by stopping the supply of weapons in the required quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Ukraine currently lacks the technical advantage for a strategic counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

Old Europe, primarily Germany, France, and Italy, would like to compel Ukraine to accept such terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. However, Great Britain, Poland, the Baltic countries, and some smaller European states resist this desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The position of the United States is decisive, as the supply of weapons and military-political assistance largely depends on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. At the moment, the US is resisting this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Consultations continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

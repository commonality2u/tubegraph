The existence of [[putins_doubles_and_their_future | Putin's doubles]] has been a topic of discussion for at least two years [00:02:55]. Observations in February (presumably 2023) provided evidence supporting this claim [00:02:59].

## Evidence and Observation
A comparison of [[russian_political_dynamics_and_putins_public_appearances | Putin's public appearances]] revealed distinct behavioral patterns:
*   **Federal Assembly Speech vs. Luzhniki Concert**: The behavior patterns of the individual speaking before the Federal Assembly and the individual speaking at the concert in Luzhniki were "radically different" [00:03:09], suggesting they were "different people" [00:03:17].
*   **Photographic Evidence**: Careful examination of photographs available online also supports the claim of different individuals [00:03:21].
*   **Journalistic Claims**: Journalist Alexander Minkin reportedly wrote an article at the end of February claiming the presence of a double [00:03:36].

## Elite Awareness and Information Leakage
The belief in [[putins_doubles_and_their_future | Putin's doubles]] is described as a "common shared opinion" within Russia [00:03:49].
*   **Russian Elite Knowledge**: The [[role_and_perception_of_russian_leadership_and_power_structures | Russian elite]] is "very well" aware of the doubles [00:03:54].
*   **Presidential Staff Awareness**: The majority of the Russian president's staff have known about this for an extended period [00:03:56].
*   **Information Carriers**: While some believe the circle of those with this information is small, it's argued to be a "big misconception" [00:04:46]. The president's large staff, including security, service personnel, referents, and assistants, coupled with their relatives and friends, has led to information "gradually leaked out" [00:04:54]. This leakage is described as a "stream" [00:05:22].
*   **Intelligence Agencies**: Major Western intelligence agencies are "aware of the [[putins_health_and_its_influence_on_russian_politics | state of health]] of the Russian president" [00:05:27], and this [[putins_health_and_its_influence_on_russian_politics | health factor]] is considered when advising governments on military-political plans [00:05:37].

## Future Public Appearances
Looking ahead, it is anticipated that:
*   **Online Appearances**: After a course of [[putins_health_and_its_influence_on_russian_politics | treatment]] in March, Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin) will most likely appear "almost exclusively online" [00:04:05].
*   **Public Appearances by Doubles**: His double is expected to appear in public for "at least some time" [00:04:19].

## Impact on Domestic Politics
The increasing replacement of Putin by a double is seen as a "significant role in domestic politics" [00:31:42]. This process is interpreted as a delayed, but ongoing, "process of leaving" [00:31:49].

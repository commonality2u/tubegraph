The economic and financial landscape in Russia is anticipated to face significant [[economic_challenges_in_russia | challenges]], particularly in the wake of ongoing events and projected policy changes. Experts suggest a period of increased instability and hardship for the general population, with implications for savings, property, and social welfare programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

## Impact on Personal Finance

### Savings and Currency
For individuals, advice on managing savings emphasizes liquidity and portability. Keeping funds in easily movable assets, especially currency like the dollar, is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. While the ruble may currently appear stable, it is predicted to become "catastrophically unstable" during an impending crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. The dollar, conversely, is expected to remain stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>. Investing in gold is cautioned against due to a large spread between purchase and sale prices and storage difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.

### Bank Deposits
Currency deposits are largely frozen and have been forcibly converted to rubles, making it unlikely for individuals to retrieve them in their original foreign currency. Banks are expected to cite "force majeure circumstances" as a reason for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. Ruble deposits, while not directly threatened with confiscation—as the Central Bank can print more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>—will face depreciation in a turbulent economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>.

### Loans and Mortgages
In the event of a general mobilization, a deferment of payments for loans and mortgages is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. If an individual dies at the front, their loans might be written off or offered to their family on preferential terms; this is considered a question primarily for the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Property and Assets
The decision to sell assets like apartments or cars at a reduced price to withdraw funds from Russia depends on an individual's strategy and plans to leave the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. While assets are depreciating, it is not anticipated that private apartments will be nationalized, as this level of confiscation is likened to conditions seen before 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>. However, in regions closer to conflict zones, such as Belgorod, selling housing, even at a lower price, might be advisable due to escalating situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.

## Government and Economic Policy

### Nationalization of Property
The potential introduction of martial law, particularly after the New Year holidays, could allow authorities to conduct labor mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. It also includes the right to force changes in ownership of organizations or enterprises, implying that private companies could be taken away. There are expectations that large corporate private property may be nationalized or transferred to "patriotic hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Furthermore, martial law allows for the seizure of private property with subsequent compensation, though the nature of this compensation is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Pension Reform
The previously enacted pension reform, which increased the retirement age, is unlikely to be canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. While compensation for lost pension payments would be just, Russia's future state of mass poverty and a meager budget will likely make this impossible in the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. If compensation were to occur, it would ideally come from oil and gas revenues, which are themselves expected to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

### Government Procurement
Financing for government procurement, repairs, and reconstruction in the social sphere is expected to be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>. Conversely, spending related to the defense industry is projected to increase, as indicated by budget projects for the upcoming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.

### Food Security
While severe food shortages are not anticipated for the immediate future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>, there might be disruptions related to logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. Preparations are underway in some regions for the introduction of food rationing or food cards. These measures are not primarily due to a lack of provisions but rather to ensure access to cheap food for socially vulnerable populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Russia is anticipated to enter a period of "disorganization [and] chaos," potentially making the 1990s seem like a "faint reflection" of what is to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. This will not affect all areas uniformly; large cities might experience significant disruption, while some residential areas could remain relatively calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>. The upcoming year (following 2022) is predicted to be even harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. Despite the challenges, there is a chance for a future of quiet life and development, but this will require navigating through deterioration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. The speaker encourages preparation rather than panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>.

The current [[political_dynamics_and_elite_struggles_in_russia | political dynamics and elite struggles]] in Russia are marked by an ongoing [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | political crisis]] that is difficult to predict in its full scope and outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While the entry into a [[political_changes_and_power_dynamics_in_postPutin_Russia | political crisis]] can be foreseen with over 75% accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, approaching the accuracy of a short-term weather forecast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, its course and results are unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Active participation in the crisis, however, offers tangible chances to influence desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The most acute phase, or "peak" of the crisis, is expected to last only a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, while the crisis itself will extend over several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Key Figures and [[coalitions_in_russian_politics | Coalitions]]

The [[internal_conflicts_within_the_russian_elite | internal conflicts within the Russian elite]] are central to the current [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | power struggles]].

### Nikolai Patrushev
Nikolai Platonovich Patrushev and his allies face opposition from influential figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. These opponents are described as no less influential than Patrushev himself, making it very difficult to oppose them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. In a [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | struggle for power]], absolute loyalty among friends and allies cannot be guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Patrushev's inability to agree with other members of the "Politburo" stems from the blinding effect of power in and over Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, which can override rational sense and logical constructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Losing influence, such as if Patrushev's son is not appointed to a certain position, would not prevent the crisis but rather strengthen and deepen it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, as Nikolai Platonovich would certainly not accept such a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Sergey Chemezov
Contrary to some impressions, Patrushev's faction does not possess absolute power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. The strength of the [[coalitions_in_russian_politics | coalitions]] is equal, and Sergey Chemezov's coalition may currently be even stronger than Patrushev's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Kostin, a VTB team member, gravitates towards Chemezov's coalition, as do the overwhelming majority of business people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Role of State Bodies in the Crisis
Various state bodies are expected to play distinct roles in the upcoming crisis, largely aligning with the winning side.

*   **Prosecutor General's Office and Investigative Committee**: These bodies are expected to align with the winning side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. In the acute phase of the crisis, they may not play a direct role as they lack armed resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. However, they can serve as important instruments in the hands of one of the competing [[coalitions_in_russian_politics | coalitions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA)**: The MIA is likely to subordinate itself to the winning side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. However, its leadership might make a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, making neutrality the most preferable position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. The MIA as an organization is expected to follow a "fortress plan" â€“ closing itself off, not letting anyone in or out, and doing nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This behavior is compared to the KGB of the USSR in August 1991, which also followed a "fortress plan" to defend itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Defense and General Staff**: The Ministry of Defense will likely play no role and adopt a position of neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Within the General Staff and among army personnel, the main department (likely referring to the Main Intelligence Directorate, GRU) could play an important role when the critical moment arrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Nature of the Crisis and Future Outlook
The political crisis, while acute for days, will unfold over months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

*   **No Civil War or Collapse**: The [[internal_politics_and_power_dynamics_in_russian_leadership | elite war]] is not expected to escalate into a large-scale civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a> or the collapse of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. The necessary and sufficient conditions for such events are absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.
*   **Armed Excesses**: While a full-scale civil war is unlikely, localized armed excesses are possible, particularly in the center of the Russian capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. These may involve the threat of using weapons rather than actual deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:33">[00:36:33]</a>.
*   **Territorial Risks**: There is a risk of a split or withdrawal of some territories, with the North Caucasus identified as a historically dangerous zone in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.
*   **Leadership Preferences**: Figures like Patrushev Sr. and Chemezov prefer to govern or influence Russia from behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>.
*   **Prigozhin's Return**: It is expected that Yevgeny Prigozhin will "get in touch" and reappear in the Russian Federation at a time he deems most favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
*   **Confidence in Change**: Confidence in an incoming team's ability to take power is based on knowledge of the specific situation in society and an understanding of the balance of power, alongside "some other things" that cannot be disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

## Broader [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Sociopolitical Dynamics]]
The [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian sociopolitical dynamics]] are also characterized by widespread theft and corruption, exemplified by the Gelendzhik palace, which is described as a gigantic theft of budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. The authorities are seen as fearful of the people, especially armed people, leading to tighter weapons legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. The current Russian authorities are portrayed as indifferent to the problems of society, such as PTSD among the population, viewing such issues as belonging to the public, not themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>. For the authorities, the populace is merely a "working code" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.

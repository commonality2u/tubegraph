From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Valery Solovey discusses various aspects of the upcoming second round or continuation of the so-called partial mobilization, answering questions from viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This program, the 16th episode, addresses the most relevant, important, and interesting questions left in comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Potential Future of Mobilization
The "partial mobilization," which has not formally ended, is most likely to [[potential_future_mobilization_and_military_strategies | resume with renewed vigor]] in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The database of those potentially subject to mobilization currently contains about 15 million people but is rapidly expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. If military dynamics are negative for Russia, the scale of mobilization will increase, and the risk of martial law will definitely increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

## Restrictions and Enforcement
The speaker notes that questions about the possible blocking of bank accounts and cards are among the most frequent and important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Financial Restrictions
While amendments to the law on the creation of a single register of military personnel do not explicitly include a restriction on blocking bank accounts or cards, this is considered the easiest and most effective way to force people to report to military registration and enlistment offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The banking system, according to the speaker, is ready for such measures, with Nabiullina having prepared for this since September of the previous year based on presidential instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It might not be a blanket blocking for everyone, but for those who receive electronic summonses or appeals, which would still cause a multiplier effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Advice:** It is recommended to stock up on cash, similar to how those with loan or alimony debts already live under financial restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Authorities are not concerned with how people will manage their work or living expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Other Legal Restrictions
The amendments to the law creating a single register of military personnel include other types of restrictions for those subject to mobilization:
*   Ban on traveling to the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   Ban on real estate transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Ban on registering an individual entrepreneur, and potentially on related activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   Ban on driving a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

The speaker questions the effectiveness of these restrictions alone, noting that many people do not have foreign passports (only about 20% of the population), cars, or individual entrepreneur status, suggesting they might feel protected from [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Lack of Criminal Punishment
Currently, there is no criminal punishment for evading [[issues_related_to_military_mobilization_and_its_impact | mobilization]] in the Criminal Code, and it is unlikely to appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. During the "partial mobilization" that has not yet formally ended, not a single person was punished administratively or criminally for evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Enforcement Strategies ("Hunting")
Authorities are unlikely to "hunt for everyone" but will set "traps" in busy public places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Locations:** Train stations, busy metro stations in large cities, and possibly supermarkets in small- and medium-sized cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Method:** Police patrols alongside military registration and enlistment office personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Focus:** Those who receive a summons will be primarily at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

## Impact on Specific Groups
*   **Students:** Students, including those in correspondence or full-time and part-time courses, have a right to deferment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. However, graduate students who complete their bachelor's or master's degrees this year are in a risk group, as their deferment formally extends only until September 1st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Some cases have shown this deferment being ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
    *   **Advice:** Secure a master's degree program or an enterprise that provides a reservation to avoid conscription and [[mobilization_strategies_and_preparations | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Those Abroad:** For those living in another country for over six months with a residence permit, there is no point in being removed from military registration by proxy or communicating with Russian authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Returning to Russia at the end of summer or beginning of September for men currently outside the country is highly dependent on political dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Women, Pensioners, and Children:** If martial law is declared, it is unlikely to close borders for all categories of citizens. Restrictions will likely apply to those in the database of individuals potentially subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Reservists:** Should be wary of traveling around Russia by plane and train, as these are places with busy traffic where those who could be called up will be monitored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Drivers (car, armored vehicle) are needed first and foremost among reservists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Conscripts:** There is an expectation that conscripts will be pressured to sign contracts for military service almost immediately upon starting their service, a change from the previous requirement of 3 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
    *   **Advice:** Do not sign anything and contact lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Martial Law Implications
Martial law includes a ban on the movement of Russians between regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Resistance
The speaker sees no current hope that the upcoming mobilization will shift public opinion in favor of peace supporters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. While a latent discontent is growing, other circumstances and their combination are needed for public opinion to transition from negative disposition to public action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
The speaker advises against engaging in public action when risks are "colossally high" for people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. He suggests supporting through reposts or [[financial_implications_of_mobilization | financial]] assistance to those fighting for freedom and justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.

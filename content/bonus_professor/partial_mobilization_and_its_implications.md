From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Valery Solovey addressed common questions regarding the potential second phase or continuation of partial mobilization, which he considers a highly relevant and important topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The first phase of partial mobilization has not yet formally concluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, but it is anticipated to resume with renewed intensity in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Potential Restrictions on Citizens

Questions about [[consequences_and_impact_of_mobilization | possible restrictions]] on citizens were prominent.

#### Financial Restrictions
The most frequent questions pertained to the potential blocking of bank accounts and cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Although amendments to the law on the creation of a single register of military personnel do not explicitly state this restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, it is seen as the most effective method to compel people to report to military enlistment offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The banking system, led by Nabiullina, has been preparing for such measures since September of the previous year under presidential directives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This blocking may not affect everyone, but rather those who receive electronic summonses or appeals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

> "If a person works, then the card where the salary goes will also be blocked. What to do in such a case? A large family cannot leave a check, there are no savings." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>

#### Other Legal Restrictions
Current amendments to the law on the single register of military personnel include:
*   A ban on traveling to the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   A ban on real estate transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   A ban on registering as an individual entrepreneur, potentially extending to activities within an individual entrepreneur's framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   A ban on driving a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

However, these restrictions might not be universally effective, as only about 20% of the population has foreign passports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, and not everyone owns a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a> or operates as an individual entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Evasion and Enforcement Tactics

Currently, there is no criminal liability for evading [[mobilization and military readiness | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, and it is unlikely to be introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. No one was administratively or criminally punished for evasion during the initial partial mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

The authorities aim to encourage voluntary enlistment through various methods, including material promises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Those who find themselves in difficult situations, such as having their cards blocked, might feel compelled to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

Enforcement will primarily involve setting "traps" in high-traffic areas, such as:
*   Train stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Busy metro stations in large cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   Supermarkets in small to medium-sized cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, where police patrols and military enlistment office personnel may be stationed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

Reservists should be wary of traveling by plane and train within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, especially those who have received a summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

### Impact on Specific Groups

#### Students
Students, including those on correspondence, full-time, and part-time courses, generally have a right to deferment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. However, graduates (bachelor's and master's) are in a [[consequences_and_impact_of_mobilization | risk group]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. While their deferment formally extends until September 1, it has been ignored in some cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Graduates should look for master's programs or enterprises that can provide a reservation to avoid conscription and mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

#### Those Abroad
Men currently outside the Russian Federation should base their decision to return on the dynamic of political events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. If the situation for Russia and its armed forces deteriorates, the scale of mobilization and the risk of martial law will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

Regarding removal from military registration by proxy for sons living abroad, it's advised not to engage with Russian authorities or report information about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

#### Drivers
Drivers are identified as a primary need among reservists, including car drivers and armored vehicle drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### Advice for Individuals

*   **Financial Preparedness**: Stock up on cash, as authorities were never interested in people's work situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. People should be prepared to "spin" and navigate the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Contract Signing**: Conscripts should not sign any contracts for military service voluntarily if pressured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. They should contact lawyers and resist pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Travel**: Prepare for the possibility of martial law, which could include a ban on movement between regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **General Outlook**: The speaker advises to "get ready for the worst" based on years of experience living in the Soviet Union and Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Broader [[social_and_national_implications_of_mobilization | Implications]]

#### Martial Law
In the event of martial law, border closures will likely apply to those in the database of individuals potentially subject to mobilization, currently around 15 million people and rapidly expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Other citizens, including women, pensioners, and children, would likely still be able to leave and enter Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

#### Public Opinion and Peace
The speaker believes there is no hope that the upcoming mobilization will shift public opinion in favor of peace or concern for human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. While discontent is accumulating, other circumstances are needed for it to manifest as public action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

#### Future of the Russian Federation
The speaker states that the Russian Federation will not fall apart even if it loses to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. While problems are anticipated in regions like the North Caucasus and the Volga region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>, the potential for preserving Russia's unity is much higher than any separatist potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. The risks of collapse are considered negligible unless the current political crisis drags on for longer than a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

#### Presidential Elections
The speaker believes that presidential elections in 2024 will not take place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>, and there will be a different agenda.

#### Repression and Control
Repression is expected to intensify rapidly, not over years but months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. There is an intention by authorities to tighten digital control over individuals and their finances, limiting freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. The concept of an "Electronic Gulag" no longer seems like a metaphor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. Despite the purchase of popular bloggers for VK and RuTube, YouTube will not be blocked, as it is technically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

#### Security Forces
If the country's situation improves, security forces will undergo significant reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. Some personnel will retire, others will be subject to lustration, and some will remain but within reformed structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. Comprehensive reform, particularly of the courts, will take several years, but plans exist and political will is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>.

#### Putin's Regime
The speaker asserts that the Putin regime could have continued to exist stably without the armed confrontation with Ukraine on February 24, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>, implying the conflict was a self-inflicted wound caused personally by the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.

#### Outlook and Call to Action
There is "light at the end of the tunnel" for Russia, and it will be seen sooner than many now believe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. While the hardest times in post-Soviet history are ahead, a favorable way out for Russia and Russian society exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. The goal is to make the country and society more just, based on the belief that justice is a powerful human motive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that calls for action are context-dependent; when risks are high, it's dangerous to call for mass action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>. Instead, he advises actions like reposts and financial support for those fighting for freedom and justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>. Such financial support is crucial, as "nothing in Russia is done without money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>. Donations are considered an investment in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.

The present time is described as decisive, potentially marking a historical turning point for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>. The speaker expresses certainty that "victory will be ours" despite current difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:54">[00:38:54]</a>.

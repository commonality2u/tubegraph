This article discusses the planned and ongoing introduction of food cards in Russia, focusing on their purpose, implementation, and anticipated impact on the population.

## Overview
Food cards, also known as "social food cards," are being introduced in Russia as a measure to address an impending "threatening catastrophe" in the country's socio-economic sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>, specifically relating to [[socioeconomic_challenges_in_russia | internal Russian socio-economic problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. While initially met with skepticism and ridicule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>, their appearance is considered a "sign of something very bad, very difficult happening in the Russian economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. The government's approach to dealing with this crisis is described as reverting to "Old Soviet, even Bolshevik patterns," characterized by deficits, food cards, special distributors, and extracting money from the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a>.

## Implementation
The introduction of food cards is becoming commonplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>:
*   They are scheduled to be introduced in the Kaliningrad region after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
*   The head of the State Duma for financial markets, Aksakov, proposed extending food cards to the entire territory of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   They have already been partly introduced for certain products in other Russian cities and regions, notably Kamchatka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. Despite Kamchatka being a fish-rich region, cards for fish are being introduced there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
*   The card system is expected to be extended nationwide at varying speeds due to the severe food situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

## Purpose and Functionality
The stated purpose of social food cards is to provide an opportunity for socially disadvantaged strata of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. In Kaliningrad, they are intended for "socially vulnerable citizens," primarily pensioners whose income falls below the subsistence minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

It is important to note that these cards do not provide free access to a social minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Instead, they allow users to *buy* food and other necessary products at "social prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

The primary reason for their introduction is the "most serious" non-harvests in the Russian Federation in over 20 years, leading to an acute shortage of provisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. This shortage is expected to be most acute in the Trans-Urals and Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

## Quality of Products
Reports from Kamchatka indicate that the quality of products available through these cards is poor; for example, fish bought by pensioners was described as "awful," with the meat falling off the bones when defrosted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. This low quality is compared to the unpleasant "squash caviar" commonly found in Soviet stores during the Perestroika era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

It is anticipated that the cards will primarily distribute "illiquid goods" or provisions of inappropriate quality, effectively serving as a dumping ground for unsold or low-grade stock from food chains and manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. The stated benefit is that this will allow people "not to die of hunger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

## Comparison with US Food Stamps
The Russian authorities may cite the existence of food stamps in the United States, where 41.5 million people regularly receive them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. However, key differences are highlighted:
1.  **Cost:** In the United States, recipients receive provisions for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>, whereas in Russia, users must *buy* the provisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.
2.  **Quality:** Provisions received via food cards in the United States are of normal quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>, unlike the expected low quality in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

## Social Stratification
The system is expected to reinforce social stratification. While the "socially vulnerable" population will receive low-quality, purchased provisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>, the Russian "nomenklatura" and those associated with the regime will have access to different, presumably higher-quality, provisions through their own "special investigations" or distribution channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. High-quality provisions will become very expensive, forcing people to rely on low-quality options for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

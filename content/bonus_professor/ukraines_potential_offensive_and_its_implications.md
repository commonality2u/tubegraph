## Anticipation of the Ukrainian Offensive

As of May 1, 2023, there is a widespread anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive, which the speaker clarifies should be called an "offensive" rather than a "counteroffensive" because the Russian army is perceived to have lost its offensive potential long ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. The Russian military is described as having "gloomy expectations" regarding this impending offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. While military success for Ukraine is not a foregone conclusion, it appears "probable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

Russian General Staff officers are reportedly taking seriously the prospect of fighting on the territory of Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. The possibility of Ukrainian armed forces reaching the border with Crimea is considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. With currently available missiles, Ukraine could cover the Kerch bridge, potentially turning Crimea into an island by stopping all connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. This possibility is considered "relatively" and "maybe even more than real" by the Russian military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

Yevgeny Prigozhin's interview expressed "very great" fears regarding the success of a Ukrainian offensive, warning the public that he would not be to blame in case of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>. He indicated that his Wagner group cannot solve all problems, especially with limited ammunition and personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. He suggests that if the Ukrainian offensive succeeds, the situation will "go to hell" in a very noticeable way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:25:00">[18:25:00]</a>.

## Implications for Russia

### Military and Frontline Situation
The Russian armed forces are currently unable to report successes, achievements, or victories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. Specifically, Bakhmut has not yet been taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. According to Yevgeny Prigozhin's interview, the situation on that section of the front, and the front as a whole, is "far from brilliant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. No progress is being made in other areas, with battles being fierce in some places and sluggish in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

Russia faces a shortage of personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a> and ammunition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. Recruitment campaigns for contract soldiers are reportedly not very successful, despite offering significant incentives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. The target for contract soldiers was 400,000 to 500,000 people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>. Summonses are being issued in St. Petersburg for document verification, implying potential restrictive measures for non-compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. The Ministry of Defense and private military companies like Redut are now intensively recruiting prisoners, a role previously dominated by the Wagner PMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.

### Internal Political and Social Implications
Due to the military situation, mass public events, particularly outdoor ones, for May 1st and May 9th have been cancelled in frontline regions adjacent to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. Parades have been cancelled even in Moscow, where Red Square was closed for "quarantine" in preparation for the parade, and the air part of the parade was cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

The presence of Ukrainian drones is a concern, with drones reportedly flying into Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>, leading to elements of a "siege or semi-siege state" in the capital, including an increased number of Russian Guard patrols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

The health of President Putin is a major source of tension within the establishment, with his health described as "extremely bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. It is claimed that a double appeared at public events last week, including the opening of the Turkish nuclear power plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. The discussion of the president's doubles has intensified both outside and inside Russia, becoming a "media reality" and a "reality of public opinion" that will affect people's behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. The president is viewed by Russians as a "key problem," "key threat," and a "toxic asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

### International Relations
Russia's leadership, particularly President Putin, is experiencing international isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. South Africa reportedly asked President Putin not to attend a conference in August but to speak via video link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. It is also noted that the president has generally decided against international trips, possibly with the exception of Minsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>.

A conversation between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is seen as further evidence of Russia's deteriorating international standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>. Following this conversation, Zelensky claimed China consented not to supply weapons to the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>, suggesting China is "comparing watches" not only with Moscow but also with Kyiv before the Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.

### Response to Challenges
The authorities' only response to these challenges is to tighten internal repressions against those considered the "fifth column," "traitors of the Motherland," or "dangerous subjects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:58:00">[18:58:00]</a>. This policy is described as "dangerous" and "very painful" for those who retain a civil temperament and express their own opinions in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:52:00">[19:52:00]</a>.

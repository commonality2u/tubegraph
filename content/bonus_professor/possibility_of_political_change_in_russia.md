Valery Solovyov discusses the prospects and nature of [[possible_future_political_changes_in_russia | political changes in Russia]], addressing questions about the timeline, driving forces, and potential outcomes for the country and its citizens.

## Prospects for Change of Power
The chances for a change of power by the end of 2022 are considered "tiny" but "not zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. While not guaranteed, "invisible" but important events in December could significantly influence a decisive stage in Vladimir Putin's departure from politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The horizon for his legal capacity is "extremely limited," a fact known to him and his entourage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The entourage could potentially accelerate this [[political_transition_in_russia | process]] as military actions escalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

> [!INFO] Expected Timeline for Change
> A change of power is more likely to occur in the following year, not in the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Driving Forces of Change
The main driving force for a [[political_transition_in_russia | Russian coup]] is expected to be the elites, rather than the opposition or Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The [[potential_political_transition_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | transition]] is anticipated to initially develop as an elite conflict, with some factions seeking societal support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The "Warsaw Congress of people's deputies" was viewed as primarily a PR exercise with little tangible result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## Future of Russia
### Path to Democracy
Russia is expected to become a free and truly democratic country "in our lifetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. While becoming free might not take long, the establishment of functional democratic institutions and procedures could take at least 10 to 15 years, or possibly longer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Impact of Turmoil and Crisis
Approaching turmoil is likely inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. While the country will face "very serious upheavals" and a crisis potentially more dangerous and acute than the 1993 crisis, it will not lead to Russia's collapse or death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The country and society are expected to cope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

### Potential Worsening of Conditions
It is suggested that a change from the current power structure to the most likely successor could initially lead to conditions getting "worse" for a few months, rather than immediately better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

### Leadership After Putin
Medvedev is not considered a viable candidate for Putin's successor, as he is widely perceived as a "clown" and is not trusted by the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. The idea of Lukashenko becoming the leader of Russia is dismissed as unrealistic with "zero" probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

### External Threats Post-Putin
Should Russia's leadership change and it stops threatening others, external threats are expected to be "significantly minimized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Western-direction threats would disappear, with the main challenge shifting to the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### Future of Belarus
The future of Belarus, whether it becomes more integrated with Russia or breaks away, "exclusively depends on the dynamics of the [[prospects_of_political_crisis_and_potential_changes_in_russian_governance | political situation in Russia]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. If a crisis begins in Russia, Lukashenko will likely have to leave his position, and Belarus will naturally distance itself from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.

## Putin's Health and Doubles
When observing videos or photographs of Putin, one should consider whether it is "Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin or that double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>. A double would not necessarily suffer from the same illnesses as the Russian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>. The behavior of figures like Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin, acting "as if the Russian president no longer actually exists," can be interpreted as an indication of Putin's actual status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. The "near future" is expected to provide clearer answers regarding Putin's health and physiological outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

## Recommendations for Citizens Amidst Political Uncertainty
Individuals are advised to formulate a "survival strategy" based on the likelihood of a second wave of mobilization and martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>.

*   **Mobilization:** Those of draft age should consider whether they want to end up in the trenches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
*   **Leaving Russia:** If resources allow, leaving Russia is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Internal Relocation:** Moving within Russia, despite inconveniences, might be an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   **Minors and Students:** Underage school students are strongly recommended to enroll in higher education with state accreditation to secure a deferment from conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. If this isn't possible, finding a safe place to "sit out" difficult months is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>.
*   **Leaving Abroad:** For those who can go abroad and sustain themselves, it's advised to leave "now," as it may become impossible after the second stage of mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
*   **Preparation for Those Staying:** If staying, prepare, valuing one's life and the lives of family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.
*   **Weapons and Community:** Legally acquiring weapons is suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>. Coordinating with neighbors for mutual support will be necessary in the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.
*   **Young Families:** Mobile young families should make existential choices based on valuing "life, freedom, or the threat of death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

Despite the gloomy prospects, Solovyov concludes with an optimistic outlook, stating that "at the end of this tunnel the light awaits us, the sun of a new Russia awaits us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>, assuring that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

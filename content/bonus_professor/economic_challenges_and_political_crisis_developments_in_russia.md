Valery Solovey presented the 132nd episode of "What's Happening" on Monday, July 15, at 1 PM Moscow time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. He explained his recent absence was due to a very busy and intensive trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Concerns Regarding Stability in Russia

### Impending [[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_russia | Political and Economic Crisis]]

The speaker anticipates a critical situation this fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. More informed sources suggest that by the end of the year, the situation will become "extremely critical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
A special meeting on July 25, called "the funnel," will discuss these developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. This meeting will address:
*   **[[domestic_political_challenges_in_russia | Political problems]]**: The speaker notes an intense, latent struggle behind the scenes leading to a [[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_russia | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. While nothing overt seems to be happening in mid-summer, underlying currents are developing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **[[economic_challenges_in_russia_and_governmental_strategies | Economic situation]]**: Despite official reports of well-being and GDP growth, the [[economic_conditions_in_russia | economic situation]] is extremely worrying to the authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Monetary authorities view the emergence of significant [[economic_challenges_and_financial_management_in_russia | problems]] as inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.
*   **Mobilization**: Conversations about mobilization have returned to the agenda of the military leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. However, there are very influential people within the [[internal_political_dynamics_and_challenges_in_russia | Russian leadership]] who are against mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

The speaker highlights that blocking communication channels like YouTube and WhatsApp is an attempt to prevent protest mobilization ahead of these anticipated problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Government's Assessment of Public Sentiment

Sociological measurements conducted by the Federal Security Service are used by authorities to assess mass sentiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.
*   **Dissatisfaction**: There is great, even "extremely" great, dissatisfaction with the authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.
*   **Lack of Readiness for Protest**: Despite widespread dissatisfaction, people are not ready to oppose the authorities or demonstrate their discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. They prefer to exhibit "emphatically loyalist" or opportunistic behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.
*   **Expected Reaction to YouTube Block**: The authorities do not expect a mass negative "effective reaction" (i.e., actions) to the blocking of YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. While it may add to tension, it is deemed a worthwhile risk to avoid more serious [[economic_challenges_and_financial_management_in_russia | problems]] in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## Information Control Measures

### YouTube Blocking Plans

Exercises to slow down and block YouTube were recently conducted under the instruction of Nikolai Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. These exercises were considered relatively successful by the military-political leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
Based on these results, a decision has been made to block YouTube on a nationwide scale in August-September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This will be a one-time block, similar to how Facebook and Instagram were banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. WhatsApp is also slated for blocking alongside YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

The authorities aim to block the ability for protest mobilization, as YouTube is a source of information and WhatsApp a coordination tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### Recommendations for Users

The speaker advises viewers to:
1.  **Obtain reliable VPNs**: The government will try to block VPNs, but it's an ongoing "fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. YouTube is expected to lose 30-40% of its audience after the block, partly due to fear and technical inability to use VPNs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. The [[political_and_economic_conditions_in_russia | Russian authorities]] have also made a decision to block any information or advertising about how to use VPNs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
2.  **Register on Telegram**: Telegram is not expected to be blocked due to past unsuccessful attempts and the belief that it is impossible to block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Viewers are encouraged to register on Telegram channels associated with the speaker for operational information and instructions during the upcoming critical situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Other Topics

### Assassination Attempts
*   **Donald Trump**: An assassination attempt was made on US presidential candidate Donald Trump on Saturday, July 13, during a rally in Pennsylvania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The speaker believes this attempt, from which Trump was saved by a miracle, will likely play a decisive role in his ascent to the presidency, making his chances of losing small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Ukrainian Intelligence and Putin**: The head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Budanov, claimed unsuccessful attempts were made to assassinate "President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. However, the speaker clarifies that prior to February 24, 2022, no assassination attempts on "President Putin" reached the stage of organizational preparation, remaining at the level of conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. He was one of the most protected people in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. After February 2022, the idea of assassinating the [[political_and_economic_conditions_in_russia | Russian president]] naturally arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Russian Leadership and Zelensky**: The Russian military-political leadership also considered assassinating the Ukrainian president, expecting Zelensky to leave Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. A hunt for Zelensky began but was unsuccessful, though missiles were fired at his locations this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Zelensky's security is credited with highly professional work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Security of Current Russian Leadership**: The person who replaced "the late Putin" is guarded with the same high level of security, making organizational stage attempts unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Other Inquiries
*   **Kyiv Children's Hospital Rocket**: A rocket hitting a children's hospital in Kyiv was described as a tragic accident, not a deliberate order, due to the imprecision of Russian missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. This incident will have serious undesirable consequences for the nascent peace process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Russian Deputies' Real Estate Abroad**: The speaker encouraged asking the State Duma Chairman why Russian deputies with real estate in NATO countries are not declared foreign agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.
*   **Officials Withdrawing Money Abroad**: "First-class people" (officials) are able to withdraw money abroad and have families living there, controlling a large share of national wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.
*   **Belousov's Promotion**: The campaign to advertise Belousov is attributed to the Ministry of Defense's public relations service, which is promoting its new boss for survival and reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.
*   **Migrant Policy**: The government's policy on migrants changed after the Crocus terrorist attack, though the changes are not systemic enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. A more effective policy would involve introducing a visa regime with Central Asian countries to protect the country's safety and way of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.
*   **Propagandists' Silence**: The speaker did not answer why propagandists do not address his programs, suggesting people ask the propagandists directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.

### Call to Action for Viewers
The speaker emphasized the importance of financial support for his work, stating that "nothing in politics, unfortunately, is done without money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>. He stressed that victory for "Russia" and its "liberation" will be achieved when people who desire well-being, honest and fair life, and focus on domestic development determine the country's fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. He expressed certainty that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.

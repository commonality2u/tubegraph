Valery Solovey anticipates a serious political crisis in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:40">[01:44:40]</a>, which he expects to be sharp, cardinal, and large-scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>. He believes the regime in Russia will change immediately or shortly after this crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>, with 2023 having the potential to be a decisive year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>. This [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | potential political crisis]] is expected to see the convergence of societal and elite interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

## Economic Implications

### Currency and Real Estate
During a political crisis, people typically move towards defensive assets such as currency or potentially gold, though gold presents many problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:19">[01:51:19]</a>. Solovey assumes that currencies will rise in price, while real estate in Moscow will likely decrease in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. The duration of the crisis is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. If the crisis is relatively short-lived, real estate prices could begin to rise again upon exiting the crisis, while currency values might stabilize or decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. Current demand for real estate is reportedly declining, which could make future sales more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. For those planning to leave Russia permanently or for a long time, selling real estate now might be advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. However, for those prepared for a long game (a couple or more years) and willing to take risks, holding real estate might ultimately lead to a win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

### Pensions
A new government in Russia would need to address the pension system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. Key actions would include:
*   Cancelling the increase in retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   Compensating those who lost benefits due to the retirement age increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
*   Increasing pensions by reducing non-productive state expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

Despite these steps, a radical increase in pension size (2-3 times) is deemed unlikely in the near future without a comprehensive reform of the pension system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. The past "pension reform" was merely an increase in retirement age, not a true reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

### Financial System and Economic Growth
After a regime change, the financial system will require significant revisions, including banking, credit, financial, and monetary policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>. The state may need to offer credit holidays and assume responsibility for some irrevocable debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>. The most effective way to help the population is to create conditions for economic growth and prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.

### State-Owned Companies
For large state-owned companies like Gazprom, immediate privatization or dismemberment is not necessarily the first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:29">[00:59:29]</a>. The priority should be to implement effective management that serves public and national interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>. Partial privatization could be considered later when market conditions improve and the companies are successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:42">[00:59:42]</a>.

## Future of Russia and Society

### Human Rights and Rule of Law
In post-Putin Russia, all laws and by-laws that violated fundamental human rights will be cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Those responsible for developing, initiating, or inspiring these laws will be punished according to the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. A new service, possibly within the Ministry of Internal Affairs, should be created to restore constitutional legality and ensure compensation for those whose rights suffered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This will be a systematic and long-term effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

### Preventing a "North Korea" Scenario
The idea of Russia transforming into a "plague Barack" or North Korea is considered extremely unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Even within the ruling elite and among Chekists, there is no strong desire to pursue such a path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. While a small group might encourage this option, the broader establishment does not wish to live in isolation from the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

### Chinese Influence
If Russia significantly weakens, a form of Chinese influence or "aggression" through demographic filling of sparsely populated areas is not ruled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. Current and future mobilizations are expected to further increase Russia's demographic sparseness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

### Democracy and Transformation
Russia has a chance to shed its imperial and colonial legacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. While a direct "revolution" is not predicted, a sharp and large-scale [[potential_political_crisis_in_russia | political crisis]] is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. The form of resolution – revolution or evolutionary process – is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>, but peaceful transformations can be equivalent to revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
The speaker believes that there is a chance for democracy in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>, though establishing it will be a process that takes time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. The nature of people does not change instantly, but cultural models and values can change relatively quickly over 10-15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
The speaker asserts that Russia will definitely become a democratic republican state, albeit with adjustments for changes over the last century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:45">[01:07:45]</a>.

### Expats and Future Russia
Russians living abroad have limited opportunities to influence the future of Russia currently. These include providing financial assistance to worthy individuals or organizations, advocating for Russian political prisoners in their host countries, and participating in protests and solidarity events at Russian embassies or government buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. When [[economic_implications_of_political_transitions_in_russia | economic and political changes]] begin in Russia and a large-scale [[political_and_economic_climate_in_russia | economic transformation]] starts, the knowledge, technologies, management experience, and capital of expats will be valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Russia is anticipated to be a country with a high margin, offering significant earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

### Public Opinion and Propaganda
The speaker notes that "normal sane people" can see the absurdity of current events, but differentiates them from those who have been subjected to deliberate Russian propaganda for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>. People often perceive what they agree with as true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. An analytical position in a tense situation often draws criticism from all sides involved in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

### Denunciations
The practice of informing on others, seen in the USSR and current Russia, is encouraged by the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. However, this phenomenon was not as massive in the Soviet era as often portrayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>. The need for denunciations will disappear once the state stops encouraging a climate of informing and administrative/police pressure on citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

## Military and Conflict Considerations

### Ukraine Conflict
Decisive military events are expected to occur from March to summer, favoring Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. The fate of occupied territories will likely be determined on the battlefield, followed by peace negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Integration of the population from currently occupied territories will likely be problematic, with many potentially choosing to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
Concerns about Ukraine's victory or fear of Russia's unpredictability have contributed to delays in arms supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>. The U.S. has reportedly bet on Russia's military defeat, which is expected to lead to [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | political changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>.

### Nuclear Weapons
If Russian armed forces suffer a crushing defeat on the battlefield in spring/early summer, the use of tactical nuclear weapons (single charge or against multiple targets) will move to a practical plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Putin has never removed this option from the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. However, there is now a high probability that people from Putin's entourage may try to interfere with such an order, as they do not want Russia to become a permanent pariah state or resemble North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

### Mobilization
A new wave of mobilization is considered almost inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Its most likely start is late February or mid-to-late February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Mobilization is already "creeping" and has not been cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. The current mobilization base includes 8 million people deprived of the right to leave Russia due to overdue loans (4 million) and alimony (4 million), plus potentially up to 7 million in the mobilization base itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:30">[01:06:30]</a>.

### Crimea
The possibility of Crimea becoming a battlefield is not excluded, according to serious scenarios presented to the Russian president and developed by analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. The future of Crimea depends solely on the military dynamics and armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

### Transport Hubs
Transport hubs facilitating weapon deliveries to Ukraine remain operational <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. While railway tracks can be smashed, they are quickly restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Striking points where European and Soviet gauge trains transfer military equipment carries a high risk of hitting neighboring territories (e.g., Poland) due to the inaccuracy of Russian missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. This could trigger Article 5 of the NATO Charter, which Russia greatly fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### Belarus Entry into War
Belarus's entry into the war is considered extremely unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.

### Consolation of Conscripts
By law, conscripts are exempt from mobilization and cannot be sent to active army units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>. However, if a massive offensive with heavy losses unfolds, this may change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>. Students have a deferment; they should carry their student IDs or a certificate of student status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. An unspoken order exists to expel and conscript students detained for hooliganism or drinking in public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Students are advised to study diligently to avoid expulsion, as academic performance in universities has reportedly increased due to this incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Those in their final years are at risk and should consider pursuing a master's degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

## Other Relevant Information

### Putin's Health and Doubles
It is suggested that Putin and his doubles may replace each other for non-public speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. The existence of doubles is noted, and they were reportedly prepared to control the situation for some time after Putin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

### Lenin's Body
The speaker believes Lenin's body should be reburied in a military cemetery, alongside other leaders of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.

### CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States)
The CIS is not doing well, with Russia appearing as "cardboard tigers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:56">[01:01:56]</a>.

### Media and Influence
Official propagandists in Russia have the most significant media resources and audience reach, despite a general decrease in their audience size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. Opposition bloggers also have influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### Foreign Relations
The speaker notes that America, in some cases, played an active role in inciting armed conflicts (e.g., Afghanistan after 9/11, Iraq) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. However, the U.S. is not considered Russia's enemy unless Russia insists on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Militarily, engaging in competition with the U.S. is seen as suicidal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
There are European countries that prefer Ukraine to negotiate with Russia on compromise terms rather than achieve outright victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.

### Transnistria
The chances of Transnistria's current status changing in the next five years are very high, linked to the anticipated [[economic and political situation in russia | crisis in Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>. Russia is unlikely to hold Transnistria during such a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

### Alexei Navalny's Team
Navalny's team is seen as reluctant to communicate with other opposition groups, believing they hold key organizational, media, and symbolic assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. They expect others to be guided by them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. The speaker believes this perspective is no longer entirely accurate, and the dynamics are not favoring Navalny's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. However, it is hoped that different segments of the opposition will eventually find common ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.

### Dmitry Patrushev
Dmitry Patrushev is reportedly "impatiently awaiting" significant changes, particularly his potential appointment as Prime Minister of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

### Secret Archives
Top state officials do not have access to absolutely secret documents like agent files or intelligence activity records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. However, broader profile documents may be accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### Information Security
For sensitive correspondence, users are advised to use messengers like Signal or Telegram's secret chats to increase reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

### Prigozhin
The speaker believes that Prigozhin and others should anticipate problems from their closest friends and associates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

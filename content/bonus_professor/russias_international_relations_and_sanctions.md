Russia's international relations, particularly concerning economic sanctions and diplomatic engagements, have been significantly impacted by domestic issues and foreign policy decisions. A key focus is on its interaction with major global players and its financial stability.

## Impact of Sanctions and Economic Challenges
Russia's economy is critically dependent on oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Government estimates suggest that Russia's current financial resources, including gold and foreign exchange reserves and the national welfare fund, would only last until October or November under the prevailing status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. To compensate for lost budget revenues, there has been a persistent suggestion to lower the ruble exchange rate to 100 per dollar, a measure Putin has resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

Despite official figures suggesting sufficient resources, Russia's economic power is not comparable to the aid provided by Western countries like Germany, Great Britain, and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. It is argued that even at $25 per barrel of oil, Russia could make ends meet by changing management, stopping "Homeric scale" stealing, and refusing non-core expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

### The Question of Sanctions Relief
The notion of lifting [[impact_of_sanctions_on_russia | sanctions against Russia]] began to be actively promoted in the State Duma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>. The argument for easing [[impact_of_economic_sanctions_on_russia | economic impacts of sanctions on Russia]] is based on the global economic difficulties and the need for mutual economic recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.

It has been indicated that the United States would not tighten [[impact_of_western_sanctions_on_russia | Western sanctions]] and might even try to soften them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. However, in the European Union, decisions regarding sanctions require consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>, making a full lifting unlikely, though some easing might occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>. The EU diplomatic department currently has no time to discuss the issue of sanctions due to more pressing problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.

In the future, with the epidemic subsiding, global cooperation and mutual assistance might lead to a reconsideration of sanctions, especially if a peaceful status and understanding are achieved in the relationship between Russia and Ukraine regarding the Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>.

## Diplomatic Engagements and Challenges
Vladimir Putin has been accused of avoiding public appearances and difficult decisions, shifting responsibility to others, including Moscow Mayor Sobyanin and Russian governors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This behavior has led to a perceived lack of confidence in his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, turning him into a factor of destabilization for the first time in 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Relations with Saudi Arabia and the OPEC+ Deal
The decision to break the OPEC+ deal was made by Putin, with Sechin's apparent acquiescence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The refusal's offensive nature created a strong personal conflict between Putin and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. The Crown Prince reportedly refused to speak with Putin on the phone, even with mediation from the Arab Emirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:51]</a>.

A significant, previously undisclosed circumstance behind the conflict is Saudi Arabia's alleged receipt of information implicating the Kremlin in the scandal surrounding Jamal Khashoggi's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:07]</a>. The Kremlin was reportedly involved in distributing and replicating information through agents and media in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:40]</a>. The motivation for this was to provoke colossal [[sanctions_against_russian_oligarchs | sanctions against Russian oligarchs]] from the United States and a hostile attitude from Europe towards Saudi Arabia, thereby forcing the Saudis into Russia's embrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:14:04]</a>.

Following this, relations between Russia and Saudi Arabia sharply improved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:12]</a>. However, just before or during the break in the OPEC+ deal, the Saudis were allegedly informed by "well-wishers" (possibly through Turks) about the Kremlin's involvement in the Khashoggi scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:45]</a>. This led to a personal vendetta, with an alleged oath of revenge taken at a Saudi family meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:13]</a>.

Russia has been forced to seek Donald Trump's influence on the Saudi Crown Prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:42]</a>. As a condition for its participation in the deal, the US demanded that Russia withdraw support from Venezuela, including evacuating Maduro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:41]</a>. Saudi Arabia also promised to buy military equipment from the US to gain protection from possible asymmetric actions by Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:21:15]</a>.

### Prospects for Oil Prices and Putin's Reputation
Global economic growth is necessary for high oil prices, which is not expected; rather, falls are likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:31]</a>. Even Russia's acceptable price of $40 per barrel may not be reached, and prices are likely to remain in a low range throughout this year and a significant part of next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:55]</a>.

The decision to break the OPEC+ deal was attributed to Putin's frustration with the Arabs and a desire to "teach them a lesson" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:45]</a>. This has led to murmurs within Putin's inner circle that his luck has run out, a stark contrast to his reputation as a very lucky person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:22:11]</a>.

### Relations with Ukraine
Despite the ongoing crisis, Russia's intentions regarding Ukraine remain unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:43]</a>. The Kremlin expects Ukraine to soon seek help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:49]</a>, potentially even accepting "military virologists" from Russia for assistance, a concept reportedly under discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:36]</a>.

Moscow had placed a significant bet on Andriy Yermak, head of the Ukrainian President's office, viewing him as a "Sherpa of the Kremlin" to manage Ukrainian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:15]</a>. A scandal involving Yermak's brother allegedly involved in selling government positions is viewed as extremely undesirable by Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:48]</a>. There is speculation that the same forces that informed Saudi Arabia about the Kremlin's involvement in the Khashoggi case might have also released information about Yermak's brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:38]</a>.

### Donbas and Constitutional Changes
It is anticipated that Russia's interest in the Donbas will decrease if the severity of the crisis in Russia itself becomes very great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:48">[00:48:57]</a>. While it may stop being active, it might not completely abandon its goals in the Ukrainian direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:04">[00:49:08]</a>.

The Donbas region is considered an important electoral resource due to people with Russian passports who have the right to vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:38]</a>. Russia aims to formally increase the number of such passport holders to a million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:51]</a>. Voting in these areas is considered "absolutely manageable," allowing for a controlled outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:12]</a>.

The entire procedure for making changes to the Russian constitution is seen as meaningless and illegitimate, implying that any new government could simply ignore it and adopt new laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:51:12]</a>. This action by Putin is seen as undermining the foundations of the regime's activity and legal tradition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:41]</a>.

An offensive in Donbas is possible if Russia deems it necessary to pressure Ukrainian leadership or distract its own society from internal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:24]</a>.

### Influence on US Elections
The results of the US elections are considered quite important for Putin, who would prefer Trump to win and will try to help him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:46]</a>. This assistance might involve providing information about the Biden family's interests in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:52">[00:53:00]</a>, which would be seen as Ukrainian in formality but actually initiated by Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:40]</a>. This information, if revealed, would be highly damaging to Biden, given American dislike for corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:23">[00:53:30]</a>.

## Broader [[International relations and diplomatic challenges for Russia | International Relations]] Context
A planned meeting of Western leaders in Moscow in May to celebrate the victory in World War II (Great Patriotic War) will not take place due to the global situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:55]</a>. The victory parade itself might also be postponed, with new possible dates being June 24 (the date of the first Soviet victory parade) or September (the end of World War II) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:55]</a>. Holding a parade without spectators or foreign leaders would diminish its meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:32]</a>.

It is suggested that Russia's structure is "loose" and less prone to collapse under pressure than a rigid, centralized system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:56]</a>. This is seen as an advantage, preventing a collapse similar to Moscow's hopes for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:07]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Qualitative political changes are underway in Russia, with the political and state structure known for the last 20 years beginning to collapse rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:59]</a>. This process could take on an avalanche-like character, leading the authorities to be more concerned with survival and confrontation with domestic political issues than with lifting sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:10]</a>.

The future is unpredictable, with many variables still unseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:34]</a>. It is expected that many changes will occur in Russia by the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:41]</a>. In Russia, the mood is worsening, with growing negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:06]</a>. It is anticipated that none of the current top figures will remain in the final configuration of power after the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:20]</a>, and new people, possibly from the opposition, will emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:23">[00:46:27]</a>. Some within the ruling elite are already considering agreeing on new positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:36">[00:46:42]</a>.

## Overview
A new purge is reportedly underway within the FSB, raising questions about its implications for the [[russian_political_climate_and_opposition_risks | Russian political climate]] and the [[opposition_dynamics_in_russian_political_landscape | Russian opposition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## FSB Purges
The purge within the FSB (Federal Security Service) is ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. Initially, in March, purges occurred within the 5th Service, which was responsible for analytical intelligence support related to the special military operation against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. Currently, a broader purge is taking place within the central office of the FSB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. The exact scale of this purge is not yet known, but more detailed reports are expected soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

## Impact on Russian Society and Opposition
This purge is anticipated to influence the [[discussion_of_repressive_practices_and_internal_politics_in_russia | internal policy of the FSB]], affecting its approach to both [[russian_societal_change_and_public_dissatisfaction | Russian society]] and the [[russian_government_and_opposition_dynamics | Russian opposition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. Notably, the purge has specifically impacted the Second Service of the FSB, which is tasked with combating political extremism and protecting the constitutional order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. The [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russian opposition]] falls under the purview of this Second Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>.

While observing these changes is of intellectual interest, a positive shift for the [[opposition_dynamics_in_russian_political_landscape | Russian opposition]] is considered unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. The liberal [[russian_political_climate_and_opposition_risks | opposition]] in Russia has been largely "defeated," with most members either imprisoned, silenced, or having left the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

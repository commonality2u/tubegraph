From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

On July 10th, 2023, the Secretary of the Russian President, Peskov, made a statement regarding a supposed meeting on June 9th between Yevgeny Prigozhin and the commanders of the Wagner private military company (PMC) with President Putin in the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Peskov claimed the meeting lasted three hours, took place in a "good, positive atmosphere," and "ended on a positive note" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## The Fabricated Meeting: A "Brazen Lie"

According to the speaker, Peskov's statement is an "elementary brazen lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. There was no such meeting on June 29th (the date mentioned in the transcript is June 9th for Peskov's statement, but June 29th for the refuted meeting), either with Prigozhin individually or with the Wagner PMC collectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This is "absolutely excluded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The most that could have happened was a telephone conversation between Putin and Prigozhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, though even this is doubted by more substantial sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Reasons for the Deception

The speaker identifies several reasons why the [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Russian leadership]], including Peskov, would propagate such a brazen lie:

### 1. To Support Putin's Reputation

The primary reason is to project an image of Putin as a "wise Leader" who is "in complete control of the situation" and "afloat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The alleged meeting attempts to frame the rebellion as a "cleverly conceived game" or "Putin's multi-move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The speaker asserts that Putin's reputation "suffered catastrophically" in the eyes of the [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | elite]], the "deep state," and partly society, following the Wagner mutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### 2. To Conceal Putin's Physical Incapacity and Use of Doubles

The lie also aims to convey that Putin is "physically capable" and "healthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. However, the speaker claims this does "not correspond to reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. The president, according to the speaker, "does not appear anywhere" and is "physically unable to do this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, being "constantly replaced by a double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Two doubles are most often used, with one being very close to the president in appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

> "In the existence of a double there is no doubt in any representative of the [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Russian elite]]... among them there are no skeptics on this account." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>

The speaker cites a phonoscopic (voice) and anthropological examination conducted in a G7 country, involving several independent experts, who unanimously concluded that "we see under the general name of the President of Russia three different people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This information was first shared during an online meeting on June 15th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

> "Discussions about doubles are now being conducted at the highest level," and there is "no doubt in any self-respecting intelligence service of the world" regarding their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

These conversations, even if denying the hypothesis, contribute to the "delegitimization of the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The speaker notes that this [[change_in_the_political_landscape_in_Russia | process]] is "wide character" and involves "more and more layers of society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

### 3. To Mask International Humiliation

Peskov's lies also serve to distract from Putin's "humiliation in the international arena" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

*   **Erdogan's Actions**: Turkey's President Erdogan transferred Azov fighters (banned in Russia) to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, supported Ukraine's NATO accession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, and promised intensive military aid, including Bayraktar drone factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. The Kremlin and Putin have remained silent due to Russia's critical dependence on "parallel import" through Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Macron's Refusal**: The Kremlin has recently been trying to get French President Macron to agree to a telephone conversation with Putin, despite Macron previously seeking such conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Macron is now refusing direct contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

These events, both public and non-public, indicate that the [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Russian elite]] and the [[russian_elites_and_their_interaction_with_western_organizations | Western elite]] understand that Putin is not just a "lame duck," but a "dying nature" incapable of making public decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Any trips to regions or abroad are undertaken by a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

## Impact of the Prigozhin-Wagner Rebellion

The attempted military rebellion by Prigozhin was considered "much more important" by Russian citizens than the ongoing "special operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

The [[role_and_influence_of_key_russian_political_figures_and_coalitions | Russian official media]] tried to compromise Prigozhin by exposing his luxurious lifestyle and wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. However, this was ineffective because:
1.  "There is no negative PR. The only unacceptable Feast is an obituary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Any attention keeps a figure afloat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
2.  [[russian_political_analysis | Russian society]] is generally "immune to exposure," largely due to repeated exposures by Navalny's team without tangible political consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. This has led to a perception that such wealth and behavior are the "norm" for those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
3.  Politically active society draws information from independent sources and Telegram channels, not central television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. Prigozhin's rebellion was the first major [[change_in_the_political_landscape_in_Russia | political event]] whose information and calls were primarily distributed via Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

## Future [[political_dynamics_and_potential_leadership_change_in_Russia | Political Dynamics]]

The speaker suggests that Prigozhin has acted as an "icebreaker that split the ice surrounding Putin's regime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, creating "free space" for other individuals or groups to enter the [[internal_russian_political_dynamics_and_changes | political arena]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. This could lead to "very important events," possibly in the form of a coup d'état <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Multiple groups or networks are reportedly dreaming of becoming power in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

The current crisis, which is already underway, presents a "unique opportunity" for ordinary citizens to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. Operational communication, especially through Telegram, is emphasized as crucial for citizens to know when and how to get involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>.

The speaker concludes by expressing optimism for the future and belief in eventual "Victory" for the nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:18">[00:23:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

This article addresses questions about the current state of [[russian_political_and_military_mobilization | mobilization]] and military policies in Russia, based on insights from Valery Solovey.

## State of Mobilization
The question of [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] is currently being discussed in Russia, with military officials insisting on its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. However, a decision on [[second_stage_of_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] is not expected before August, or closer to autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

### Hybrid Operations and Mobilization
The current leadership has the capacity to conduct both [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] and a hybrid operation simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. A hybrid operation does not require a significant military contingent, especially in its initial stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. The conduct of psychological and moral pressure is considered a hybrid operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

## Military Leadership and Control
Russian Army Generals often allow FSB officers to deprive them of their positions and future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. This behavior is compared to that of Red Army commanders in the 1930s, who were often paralyzed and went "as if to slaughter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. This phenomenon prompts a broader question about why society allowed such things to happen to the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

Military counterintelligence, a highly effective service within the FSB, prevents resistance from military personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Influence within the Military
Generals can influence the course of [[russian_mobilization_and_military_actions | hostilities]] and block decisions made by individuals like Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Sergei Viktorovich Chemezov and his coalition hold significant influence, comparable to or even stronger than Patrushev's 'army' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Chemezov influences [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_russia | hostilities]] by controlling technology growth and being the main supplier of defense products for the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Use of Nuclear Weapons
The ruling Kremlin team is limited in or has refused to use nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. This confidence stems from the belief that those currently responsible for Russia's [[military_preparations_and_mobilization_in_russia | military policy]] are more realistic than the late Vladimir Putin, understanding the risks of tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>. They may make rhetorical threats ("launch a fool") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.

There is a preliminary oral agreement with the Americans that nuclear weapons will not be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>.

## Conscription and Military Service
Recently, there has been an increase in illegal sending of young people unfit for [[potential_mobilization_and_military_service_changes_in_russia | military service]] (e.g., with asthma or schizophrenia) to the army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>. This is likely due to a general oral instruction to conscript anyone who does not resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

## Purpose of Hybrid War (After Putin)
The hybrid war, which was desired by the late "grandfather" (Putin), is now pursued by others to divert the West's influence from itself, keeping Western countries busy with their own problems instead of helping Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

## Police and Military
People are leaving the police force en masse because the work is hard and unsafe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. There is a risk of being sent to new territories to serve, not necessarily in the active army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. Honest police work is generally very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

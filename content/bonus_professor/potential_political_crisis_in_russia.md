From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

There is a high probability of an acute [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | political crisis]] in Russia in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This crisis is viewed as a "fatal fork" or a "fatal decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. The SVR General believes the crisis will most likely unfold in the fall, though events in the summer could spur it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>.

## Triggers and Manifestations

The detention of Timur Ivanov is cited as a visible manifestation of a split within the elite and a [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>. This detention and anticipated future arrests of certain deputy ministers are part of a plan to update and increase efficiency within the defense department, and to punish for past failures, mistakes, and abuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. These plans were reportedly discussed as early as before the New Year and in February of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

The removal of Sergei Shoigu from his post, possibly to become the head of the Russian Guard, is also discussed as a "show resignation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The opinion of those governing Russia, particularly [[Political dynamics and potential leadership change in Russia | Nikolai Patrushev]], has reportedly changed, with Shoigu not being against leaving his current position despite an anticipated "purge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Nature of the Crisis and its Aftermath

The crisis involves a complete and final break with the previous legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. Legally, it will be a revolution, breaking with prior legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. A new Russian Republic is expected to be established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

The crisis is expected to last several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:04">[00:40:04]</a>, characterized by disorganization of public life and weakening of state and municipal government functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. At the peak of the crisis, when the issue of power is decided, it will involve armed force for a "few days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>.

Possible disruptions include interruptions in electricity, gas, and water supply, especially where they were already occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. While a deficit is ultimately excluded, some interruptions are possible, and citizens are advised to prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. The crisis will involve the disintegration of the current state fabric and the creation of a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.

### Economic Implications

For small entrepreneurs, particularly in the grocery business, a crisis situation often proves to be "extremely favorable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. The speaker advises acting on new business opportunities immediately, as they may not exist tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

Regarding private property, there are no plans for "wild dreams" such as nationalizing all small and medium businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>. The current plan is to preserve small and medium businesses, while large businesses and some "strategic industries" are slated for transfer to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:05">[00:41:05]</a>.

### Geopolitical Repercussions

The speaker indicates that the current geopolitical influence of the Russian Federation in Europe and Central Asia is not significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:23">[00:30:23]</a>. However, with a new government in Russia and the fulfillment of certain conditions, particularly a peace treaty or truce with Ukraine that meets both Ukrainian and Western expectations, relations with the West could be restored fairly quickly within a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

### Internal Dynamics

It is stated that a conflict with Chechnya is "extremely unlikely" in the event of a change in Russia's leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The relationship between Chechnya and the future leadership will likely develop differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

The speaker notes that Lavrov has become very active recently because [[Political dynamics and potential leadership change in Russia | Patrushev]] was unhappy with him, and Lavrov wants to "stay alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:52">[00:28:52]</a>.

### Advice for Citizens

Citizens are advised to subscribe to Telegram resources and associated channels to stay connected for a "critical moment when the time comes to go out to the square at the appointed hour" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>. They are also urged to take care of their physical and mental health, as the crisis has already entered their lives and cannot be stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:30">[00:46:30]</a>. Despite the difficulties, the speaker expresses confidence that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.

### Future Government Plans

The speaker's team plans to be able to increase pensions significantly within a year after a change of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. They also intend to implement a system where indigenous people of Russia can receive interest from mineral sales, similar to the United Arab Emirates, within the current generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This will serve as a "reserve fund," with the "best reserve" being the health and well-being of the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

Regarding officials and security forces, the new government does not plan to "retrain" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>. Those who fall under "chandelier law enforcement" will not be able to work in that sphere, and officials who "set fire to the SRA" will not be able to work in civil or municipal service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. Otherwise, other spheres are open to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.

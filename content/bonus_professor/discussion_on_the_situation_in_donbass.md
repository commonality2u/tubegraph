The discussion on the situation in Donbass emerged from Russian President Vladimir Putin's speech to the Council on Human Rights and Civil Society Development on December 7th, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The speaker analyzes Putin's statements and contrasts them with the reality on the ground and his past actions.

## Putin's Perspective on Donbass

Putin asserted that the rights of Donbass residents were violated and they were considered "second-class people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. He claimed that Donbass residents, in turn, view Russia as a "second-class country" with no right to exist, necessitating a "consistent struggle for their national interests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. He suggested that Russia's actions, including the special military operation, are aimed at bringing "happiness and prosperity" to Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Putin also stated that Russia is the "only guarantor of the sovereignty and integrity of [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, despite new territories, previously part of [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]], being incorporated into Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

## Critique of Putin's Statements

### Human Rights and Sovereignty
The speaker highlights a logical inconsistency in Putin's stance on human rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Putin claimed that the international doctrine of human rights is used to destroy state sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, specifically threatening states "based on the power of criminals, thieves, and bandits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. However, he simultaneously argued for protecting the rights of Russians and those in Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, implying these rights should undermine [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]]'s sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

### The Start of the Conflict
Putin asserted that the war was not started by Russia, but by Ukrainian authorities in 2014 after a "coup d'etat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This narrative, a leitmotif of Russian propaganda, is contradicted by Igor Strelkov Girkin, a key figure in the "Russian world" movement, who has repeatedly stated that he "began the war in Donbass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

### Evacuation vs. Military Operation
The speaker questioned why Putin did not initiate an operation to protect the human rights and people of Donbass in 2014-2015, when military success chances were disproportionately higher than in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. It's suggested that evacuating the millions of Donbass residents would have cost "several times less than the cost of a special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

## Current Situation in Donbass
Despite Putin's claims of prosperity, the speaker states that Donbass has been "thriving since 2014" only in a sarcastic sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Since 2014, at least 1.5 million, possibly up to 2 million, people have left Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The speaker, with relatives in the region, claims firsthand knowledge of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

The speaker concludes that Putin's statements regarding Donbass and other matters reflect a "sick consciousness," suggesting a medical classification for this type of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>. This "bizarre way in which he sees the world" is a "grief and misfortune" for Russia and its neighbors, particularly [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.

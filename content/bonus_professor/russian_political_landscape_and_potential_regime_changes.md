## [[russian_political_landscape_and_potential_changes | Russian Political Landscape and Potential Regime Changes]]

The speaker, Valery Solovey, discusses various aspects of the [[russian_domestic_political_situation | Russian domestic political situation]] and potential shifts, including policy changes, lustration, economic reforms, and the nature of the current regime.

### Vision of a New Government
Should the speaker's "team" come to power, several key changes are envisioned:
*   **Civil Service Reform**: The law preventing people with mild epilepsy from working in the civil service would be changed, as it is considered a solvable problem. Historical figures like Gaius Julius Caesar were epileptics and outstanding statesmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Church and State Separation**: The church would be truly separated from the state and would not interfere in public education affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The church would decide on its own reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Foreign Policy**:
    *   Joining NATO or the European Union is deemed unrealistic in the near future, as no one in those organizations is currently considering integration with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   The immediate task would be to establish normal working relations with European institutions and NATO after hostilities cease and new forces come to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Consultations on this matter are already underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   Most sanctions could be lifted within 2-3 years, not tens of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Protection of Compatriots**: The new government would use exclusively civilized and peaceful means to protect Russian compatriots abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Property Rights**: All laws that worsen living conditions or harm people, such as the Comprehensive Development of the Territory (KRT) law, would be repealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Compensation would be allocated to all who suffered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. A special department for the Restoration of Constitutional Legality is proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Gasification**: The issue of gasification of villages and towns would be solved more intensively, with some effort, within a short timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.
*   **Migrant Policy**: A comprehensive approach would begin with reducing the visa regime, without which the migration problem cannot be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. Mass deportations of those who illegally entered or obtained Russian citizenship are possible if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.
*   **Capital Relocation**: The speaker previously supported moving the capital to Siberia, possibly to a new city called Vladisibirsk, due to the shift of economic and demographic centers to the Asia-Pacific region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. However, he is now less enthusiastic about this idea and suggests distributing capital functions among several cities, similar to the Constitutional Court's move to St. Petersburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:30">[00:37:30]</a>.

### Lustration and Accountability
Lustration (purging of officials from the previous regime) would be a key principle:
*   All judges, including those from the Supreme and Constitutional Courts, would be subject to lustration without exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   For employees of the judicial apparatus (not judges), only high-level officials, such as heads of departments, would be subject to lustration. Clerks and case manufacturers who made no decisions and could not influence anything would not be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   Propagandists like Margarita Simonyan might be "lucky" if they manage to reach the bench <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

### Current [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russian Internal Political Dynamics]]
*   **Lack of Resistance among Generals**: Generals and colonels do not resist being arrested or deprived of everything, similar to the Red Army commanders in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This is attributed to the highly effective military counterintelligence within the FSB of Russia, which paralyzes them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The speaker questions why society allows such things to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   **Influence of Sergei Viktorovich Mizov**: Mizov and his coalition possess weight, influence, and force comparable to Patrushev's "army," and possibly even stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Mizov can influence hostilities by controlling technology and blocking many of Patrushev's decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Mobilization Discussions**: The question of mobilization is being discussed, with military personnel insisting on its necessity. However, a decision is not expected until August, or closer to autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Patrushev's Role**: Nikolai Patrushev is a candidate for head of the State Council of Russia, alongside Chemezov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Weapons**: The current leadership responsible for Russia's military policy is described as less "bloodthirsty" than the late Vladimir Putin. They are more realistic and understand the risks of using tactical nuclear weapons. Threats of use are seen as rhetorical, and there is a preliminary oral agreement with Americans that nuclear weapons will not be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>.
*   **Putin's Death and Double**: The speaker reiterates that Putin is dead and his regime is led by a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. This double is described as a "pathetic copy" not resembling the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. Americans recognize him as the president because they are not interested in solving Russia's internal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>.
*   **Mass Exodus from Police**: People are leaving the police force due to hard and unsafe working conditions, including the risk of being sent to "new territories" for service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

### Economic and Social Outlook
*   **Ruble Denomination**: A denomination of the ruble would be preceded by a severe crisis and high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.
*   **Cost of Living/Pensions**: A detailed economic program by General SVR addresses increasing the cost of living, family allowances, and pensions, while regulating potential price rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
*   **Food Security**: While famine is not expected, there may be shortages of certain products, such as cereals and vegetable products, leading to crises similar to the egg crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>.

### The [[possible_future_political_changes_in_russia | Future of the Russian Regime]]
*   **Political Crisis**: The speaker predicts a deep [[prospects_of_political_crisis_and_potential_changes_in_russian_governance | political crisis]] leading to the "collapse of the regime" that will be noticeable even to ordinary citizens, definitely coming in 2024 or spring 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. He emphasizes that current events like arrests and changes in the political elite are unprecedented in 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:20:07]</a>.
*   **Public Responsibility**: The speaker argues that the dictatorship will end when people start fighting against it, not when they wait for it to collapse on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. He encourages safe forms of civic activism, such as financial assistance or subscribing to Telegram channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. The regime persists because many people are satisfied or afraid of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
*   **Propaganda's Role**: To change the mindset of Russians supporting the "Putinist regime" and ideas of revanchism, the "propaganda switch" needs to be turned off, and a different form of socialization should explain that Russia's interests lie in peaceful, calm, free, and prosperous life, not in threatening other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.
*   **China's Influence**: Russia is effectively becoming a semi-colony of China due to secret agreements that diminish Russian sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>. China provides political and military support in exchange for Russia's silence on the origin of the COVID pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a>.
*   **Hybrid War**: The hybrid war, initially desired by Putin, continues with the goal of diverting the West's influence and keeping it busy with its own problems rather than helping Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. Part of this hybrid operation includes destabilizing European countries, especially those actively supporting Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. Russia has an extensive and effective spy network, often operated by military intelligence under a foreign flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

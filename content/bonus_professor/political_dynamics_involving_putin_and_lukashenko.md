The 125th issue of "What is Happening" discussed significant political events, including the visit of "Putin's double" to Belarus and the subsequent analysis of the [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_consolidation | political dynamics]] between the two countries' leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The "Putin Double" Visit to Belarus
The program highlighted the visit of "the so-called Putin," identified as a double named Yevgeny Vasilyevich, to Belarus for a meeting with [[alexander_lukashenkos_relationship_with_china | Alexander Grigorievich Lukashenko]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The speaker asserted that the original Putin died on October 26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Lukashenko's Trolling and Perceived Dominance
The meeting's "entourage" and content were described as characteristic and indicative of underlying dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. A "funny detail" was [[alexander_lukashenkos_relationship_with_china | Lukashenko's]] greeting to the double, stating, "I am glad to welcome you to your native Belarusian land" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This was interpreted as [[alexander_lukashenkos_relationship_with_china | Lukashenko]] acknowledging the double's true origin from Mogilev, making Belarus his "native land" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

The speaker characterized [[alexander_lukashenkos_relationship_with_china | Lukashenko]] as a "fat troll" who enjoys mocking the double, similar to how he trolled the deceased Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Viewers' comments suggested that [[alexander_lukashenkos_relationship_with_china | Lukashenko]] "obviously dominated" the meeting, which they believed the original Putin would never have allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. It was also noted that the double is reportedly 5-7 cm taller than the original Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Discussion on Zelensky's Legitimacy
A key outcome of the meeting was a statement regarding the "illegitimate Zelensky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The speaker questioned the legitimacy of [[alexander_lukashenkos_relationship_with_china | Lukashenko]], who allegedly lost Belarus's elections, and described the recent Russian elections as "exceptional profanation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The double was labeled a "usurper," and the speaker claimed the double is a "puppet" of Nikolai Patrushev and members of "Politburo 2.0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. The claim of Zelensky's illegitimacy was seen as an attempt by the Russian side to "compromise" and "disavow" him, as well as to undermine the upcoming peace conference in Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

### Yanukovych's Role
The speaker mentioned that Yanukovych, who is reportedly seriously ill, was "forced to fly to Minsk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This was done to "give additional strength" to the allegations about Zelensky's illegitimacy by presenting Yanukovych as a "legitimate candidate" ready to lead a "legal Ukrainian government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Yanukovych had previously fled Ukraine with the assistance of Russian troops and paratroopers, one of whom later became a "Hero of Russia" and was reportedly involved in the Salisbury case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. The argument using Yanukovych was dismissed as "absolute fiction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Broader Implications for the Russian Political System
The discussions about a military mutiny and the perceived weakness of the [[political_dynamics_and_potential_leadership_change_in_russia | political system]] and regime are noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The speaker states that while the [[political_dynamics_and_potential_leadership_change_in_russia | Putin regime]] itself may be preserved, its "fabric is beginning to creep" and it is "beginning to weaken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This weakening is further underscored by the visit of the "Putin double" to Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

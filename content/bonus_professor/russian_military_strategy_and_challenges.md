## Western Pressure and Declarations of "Crusade"

The Munich conference, held in February 2023, is described as having declared a "crusade" against Mr. Putin personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The core tenets of this campaign include:
*   The West's deliberate intent to bring military defeat to [[russian_military_situation_and_challenges_in_ukraine | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> and to deprive it of all territorial acquisitions in Ukraine, including the peninsula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   The West's resolve not to be deterred by any threats from Putin or [[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_strategy | Russia]], including the use of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   There are indications that Putin is being provoked to react harshly, possibly to incite his inner circle to take decisive action to prevent "inadequate actions" by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## China's Position and Peace Plan

China's stance is described as "very interesting and ambiguous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. While China opposes unilateral sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, it is slowly drifting towards the Western coalition's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
A Chinese representative stated that China insists on peace and is ready to present its "Peace Plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This plan is based on respecting the sovereignty of both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, which implies that [[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_operations | Russia]] must renounce its territorial claims from Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
The speaker suggests that China, by preparing this plan, does not believe in the possibility of [[russian_military_situation_and_challenges_in_ukraine | Russia]]'s victory or in President Putin's strategic genius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. A potential meeting between Xi Jinping and Putin was reportedly conditioned on [[russian_military_strategy_and_internal_debates | Russia]] achieving a decisive victory or going for peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The first option is now considered "crossed out" by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Putin's Anticipated Response and Military Options

[[kremlin_strategic_challenges_and_military_ambitions | President Putin]] is expected to provide both a verbal and a practical (military) answer to the perceived Western ultimatum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Verbal Response: Message to the Federal Assembly
The verbal answer is anticipated in Putin's message to the Federal Assembly on February 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. The Kremlin traditionally inflates the information agenda before such addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>, but these often turn out to be "information bubbles" without significant policy changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

There are three potential options for the message, varying in their degree of radicalism:
1.  **"Horror-horror"**: Declaring a "people's war on NATO to the last Russian," potentially leading to a general mobilization and martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. However, there are currently no signs of this most radical option being chosen, as Putin himself seems to fear such a decision given past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
2.  **"Just horror"**: Announcing new "victories" to compensate for failures in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This could involve the inclusion of South Ossetia and Abkhazia into [[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_operations | Russia]], and the declaration of Transnistria's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This option is largely seen as ineffective propaganda, as average Russians are unfamiliar with these regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
3.  **"Usual nonsense"**: Pronouncing many threats and hints, but without announcing any concrete decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This option is characterized by the president "throwing a pebble into a pond" to observe public reaction before making further decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. The speaker predicts this third option is most likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

### Practical Response: New Offensive
The practical part of Putin's response is expected to be a new offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. This offensive must be carried out quickly and succeed before Ukraine receives advanced Western weapons, which could significantly increase Russian losses and are considered key to Ukraine's counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

## Challenges for the Russian Military

### Morale and Opposition to Offensive
[[russian_military_strategy_and_internal_debates | Russian military personnel]] are reportedly unwilling to go on the offensive, believing it would be a "big mistake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. They see practically no chance of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>, which highlights the low morale and psychological state of the Russian armed forces and command staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. The speaker states that moral and psychological state accounts for at least half of success or failure in conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. There is a possibility that the command staff's reluctance to go on the offensive could lead to sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>.

### Acute Weapon Shortages
There is an "acute shortage of weapons in the Russian armed forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. [[challenges_faced_by_russian_and_ukrainian_military_forces | Russia]] is using "remnants of Soviet weapons," lacking sufficient quantities of new, advanced armaments, despite past priority funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. Meanwhile, Ukraine is receiving advanced Western weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

### Mobilization Efforts
Putin reportedly desires to announce a new mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>, and organizational and technical preparations for this are ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>. Mobilization is currently proceeding in a "sluggish form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. The delay in a full, open mobilization is attributed to:
1.  Incomplete preparation of uniforms and equipment, as the required quantity could not be obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
2.  Putin's fear of the potential consequences of such a massive mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
3.  Putin's preference for unexpected decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

## Lukashenko's Disbelief and Nuclear Threats

Even [[impact_of_international_relations_on_russias_military_strategy | Putin's closest ally]], Alexander Lukashenko, demonstrates "completely obvious disbelief" in the strategic talents of the Russian Supreme Leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. Lukashenko was observed "openly trolling" the Russian president during a meeting on February 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>, highlighting a shift in the balance of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. Putin is perceived to lack confidence in himself and in the [[russian_military_situation_and_challenges_in_ukraine | Russian armed forces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

If the Russian armed forces fail to achieve success in their offensive, Putin might consider resorting to nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. Both Chinese officials and Western nations have warned against, but also made it clear they are not afraid of, such a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. The speaker suggests that Putin is "psychologically, morally ready" for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. The current global situation is described as the closest to the possibility of nuclear weapon use since the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.

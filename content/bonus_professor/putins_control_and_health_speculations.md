Russian President Peskov's statement regarding a purported three-hour meeting between Yevgeny Prigozhin, Wagner commanders, and President [[health_and_public_appearances_of_Vladimir_Putin | Putin]] on June 29th was described as an "elementary brazen lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. According to the speaker, no such meeting occurred on June 29th or any time thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. While some sources suggest a telephone conversation between [[health_and_public_appearances_of_Vladimir_Putin | Putin]] and Prigozhin might have taken place, more substantial sources doubt even this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Reasons for the Disinformation

The lie about the meeting serves several strategic purposes:

### 1. Reputation Management
The primary reason is to bolster [[health_and_public_appearances_of_Vladimir_Putin | Putin]]'s reputation as a "wise Leader" who is in "complete control of the situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The fabricated meeting aims to portray the Wagner mutiny as a "cleverly conceived game" or a "[[Vladimir Putins health and political future | Putin's multi-move]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This was deemed necessary because [[health_and_leadership_concerns_of_Vladimir_Putin | Putin]]'s reputation "suffered catastrophically" in the eyes of the elite, the deep state, and society after the attempted Wagner coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### 2. Health and Capacity Narrative
Another key reason is to demonstrate that [[health_and_public_appearances_of_Vladimir_Putin | Putin]] is physically capable and in good health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Recent public appearances, such as those in Derbent or inviting a Dagestani girl to Moscow, are described as "pure hoaxes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

#### Use of Doubles and Physical Incapacity
The speaker claims the "president does not appear anywhere, he is physically unable to do this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Instead, he is "constantly replaced by a [[putins_doubles_theory | double]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, often one of two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This claim is not doubted by any representative of the Russian elite or "self-respecting intelligence service of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

An examination conducted in a G7 country, involving phonoscopic (voice) and anthropological analysis by multiple independent experts, concluded that "under the general name of the President of Russia, three different people" are seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This evidence contributes to a narrative of [[speculations_around_putin_and_doubles | Putin's declining health]], with a reliable source indicating he is "blind already in his left eye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

#### Purpose of Public Appearances
The goal of these appearances is to project an image of an "omnipresent president" around whom society consolidates, who is "healthy, strong as never before," and leading the country "from success to success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Even proposed trips to regions or abroad would involve a [[putins_doubles_theory | double]], as the "inactive president" is "now in storage in a deep bunker from which he does not emerge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

### 3. International Humiliation
The third reason for the lies relates to [[speculation_on_putins_death_and_political_implications | Putin]]'s humiliation on the international stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

*   **Erdogan's Actions**: Turkey's President Erdogan transferred Azov fighters to Ukraine, supported Ukraine's NATO accession, and promised intensive military aid, including drone factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. The Kremlin and [[health_and_public_appearances_of_Vladimir_Putin | Putin]] remained silent due to Russia's critical dependence on "parallel import that passes through Turkey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Macron's Refusal**: The Kremlin has been actively trying to arrange a phone conversation with French President Macron, who is refusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the past, when Macron sought phone conversations with [[health_and_public_appearances_of_Vladimir_Putin | Putin]] for almost 100 hours in 2005 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Legitimacy Crisis and Political Dynamics

The ongoing conversations and widespread acceptance of the [[putins_doubles_theory | double]] hypothesis contribute to a broader process of de-legitimizing the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This process is gaining wide character and involving more layers of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The elite and Western observers understand that [[health_rumors_about_the_Russian_president_and_political_implications | Putin]] is not merely a "lame duck," but a "dying nature" and a person "not capable of making decisions" publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

### The Impact of Prigozhin's Rebellion
The attempted military armed rebellion by Prigozhin was considered "incomparably more important" by Russian citizens than the special operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. The official Russian media's attempts to compromise Prigozhin by exposing his luxurious lifestyle were ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. This is because "Russian society is generally immune to exposure" due to repeated but consequence-less revelations by figures like Navalny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Moreover, politically active segments of society draw information from alternative sources like Telegram channels, not central television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

Prigozhin is seen as the "icebreaker that split the ice surrounding [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Putin's regime]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>, opening up a "free space" for other actors to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. This crisis situation presents an opportunity for citizens to participate in future events, possibly including a coup d'Ã©tat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

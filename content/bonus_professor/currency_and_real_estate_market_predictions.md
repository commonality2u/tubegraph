Expert Valery Solovey addressed questions regarding the future of currency and real estate prices in Moscow amid an impending crisis. He emphasized that precise information on such matters is impossible to obtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Assumptions on Market Dynamics
Solovey's assumptions are based on the expectation of a [[geopolitical_consequences_and_crisis_predictions_in_Russia | serious political crisis]] in [[economic_conditions_in_russia | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. During such a crisis, people typically shift towards defensive assets like currency and, possibly, gold, although gold presents its own set of challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Under these conditions:
*   **Currency** is expected to rise in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   **Real Estate** is expected to decrease in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Short-term vs. Long-term Outlook
The duration of the crisis is a key factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. If the crisis is relatively short-lived:
*   Real estate prices could begin to rise again as the country emerges from the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   The value of currency would likely remain stable or even decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Investment Recommendations
Solovey clarified that these are general observations and not "investment recommendations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Individuals must make decisions at their own risk, considering their specific circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Considerations for individuals:
*   **If planning to leave [[economic_conditions_in_russia | Russia]] permanently or for an extended period**, selling real estate now might be advisable, especially as demand for real estate is currently declining, potentially making future sales more difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **For those prepared to hold and take risks over a longer period** (a couple of years or more), holding real estate could ultimately lead to a favorable outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Future Financial System
Looking beyond the current situation, Solovey noted that a future government in [[economic_conditions_in_russia | Russia]] would need to revise the financial, banking, and credit policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:46">[00:57:46]</a>. This would include offering credit holidays and potentially having the state assume some "irrevocable" debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>. The best way to assist people, however, would be to foster conditions for [[russian_economic_and_financial_outlook | economic growth]] and prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:05">[00:58:05]</a>.

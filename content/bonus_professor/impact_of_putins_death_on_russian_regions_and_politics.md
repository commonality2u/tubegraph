Valery Solovey, speaking from a trip, expects "great events" to begin soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:47">[02:42:47]</a>. He affirms that his team aims to see trials of "real criminals" begin as early as next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:13">[01:39:13]</a>.

## Immediate Aftermath of Putin's Death

Valery Solovey anticipates [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death_and_replacement | Vladimir Putin]]'s death will occur "absolutely definitely before the end of autumn and rather even earlier" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

The authorities are expected to attempt to conceal [[speculation_on_putins_death_and_political_implications | Putin's death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:43">[03:24:43]</a>, but this concealment will not last long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:28">[03:57:28]</a>. Information about the physical death is predicted to be revealed within 2-3 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:17">[03:30:17]</a>.

Once news of [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death_and_replacement | Putin]]'s "physical but not political death" reaches society and the elite, including regional bodies, a "shift" and "movement will begin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:04">[04:02:04]</a>.

### Initial Instability
After a short period of stability, Russia is expected to "most likely plunge into chaos" following [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death_and_replacement | Putin]]'s physical departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:24">[05:40:24]</a>. Solovey expresses hope that this chaos will be short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:07">[05:48:07]</a>.

## Political Landscape and Elite Dynamics

### Role of Doubles
The West and China are reportedly aware that [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death_and_replacement | Putin]] is being replaced by a double and are prepared to deal with such a figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:15">[08:42:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:08">[20:43:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:26">[20:48:26]</a>. This willingness is driven by their own interests: China seeks to maintain Russia's economic dependence for raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:06">[21:11:06]</a>, while the West desires political stability and control over Russia's nuclear arsenal, regardless of the form of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:04">[21:21:04]</a>. The use of a double to assume the "number one" role is expected for some time, possibly even running in the March presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:10">[08:39:10]</a>.

There is a conflict among elite groups regarding how to implement the "post-Putin rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:07">[09:00:07]</a>. This conflict is so severe that these groups will inevitably clash, leading to public disclosure of information about [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death_and_replacement | Putin]]'s death and the use of doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:05">[09:06:05]</a>.

### Key Figures and Their Fates
*   **Yevgeny Prigozhin:** Solovey reiterates his belief that Prigozhin is alive, well, and at large in Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:28">[06:17:28]</a>. The FBI's arrest warrant remains active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:20">[06:22:20]</a>. Prigozhin reportedly intends to reappear soon after [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death_and_replacement | Putin]]'s death and reveal "a lot of interesting things," particularly about the use of doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:55">[06:54:55]</a>. He is expected to join a broader alliance rather than acting independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:02">[07:15:02]</a>.
*   **Putin's Family:** The influence of [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | Putin]]'s family, including Ekaterina Tikhonova, is weakening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:07">[16:27:07]</a>, with family members expected to attempt to leave Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:07">[16:39:07]</a>.
*   **Sergei Shoigu and Dmitry Peskov:** Nothing positive awaits them after [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death_and_replacement | Putin]]'s death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:44:03">[33:44:03]</a>. Shoigu lacks influence in the armed forces and cannot play an independent role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:51:00">[33:51:00]</a>. Their fate is predicted to be "very deplorable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:02:00">[34:02:00]</a>.
*   **Sergey Kiriyenko:** There is no "Kiriyenko group" with a chance to seize power, despite Kiriyenko himself being a "brilliant technologist and a very skilled administrator" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:35:55">[25:35:55]</a>.
*   **Vladislav Surkov:** Surkov has no positions and has not been making decisions for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:06">[25:56:06]</a>.

### Changes in Governance
It is suggested that government agencies should be completely withdrawn from the Kremlin and the site turned into a museum complex, which Solovey agrees will be done, though it will take time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:08">[04:26:08]</a>.

Russia is expected to transform from a nominal federation into an actual one, with the first step being granting budgetary independence to the regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:42">[30:17:42]</a>.

### Public Reaction
While many will fear instability, not everyone will welcome [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death_and_replacement | Putin]]'s departure with joy; some will regret it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:47:00">[24:47:00]</a>. The authorities will attempt to protect society from instability by initially concealing information about [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death_and_replacement | Putin]]'s death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:06:05">[25:06:05]</a>.

## Economic Outlook

[[economic_implications_of_political_transitions_in_russia | Political upheaval]] will be accompanied by a large-scale economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. Signs of this crisis, such as ruble devaluation, inflation, and economic instability, are already observable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. Russia has allegedly seen 4 trillion US dollars, derived from resource sales, withdrawn from the country, an amount that could have transformed Russia into an "earthly paradise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:34">[09:37:34]</a>.

## Conclusion and Outlook
The coming months, possibly a year and a half, will bring "grandiose events" and changes that will "far exceed the 1990s" in scale and consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:06:17">[29:06:17]</a>. Despite the impending crisis, there will be a chance for Russia to embark on a path of "correct, free, competitive, and competitive development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:59:00">[21:59:00]</a>.

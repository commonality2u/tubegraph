## Overview
Recent developments indicate significant [[social_and_political_changes_in_russia | social and political changes in Russia]], impacting daily life and the economy. The leadership's actions and public sentiment reflect a country increasingly adapting to wartime conditions and facing growing [[economic_challenges_in_russia | economic challenges in Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Presidential Public Appearances and Security Concerns
In late 2022, the President of the Russian Federation cancelled all major year-end public events, including a large press conference and a New Year's reception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. His annual message to the Federal Assembly also remained in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Three primary reasons are cited for this:
*   **Lack of answers** The President has "nothing to say" in response to potential pressing or "unwanted" questions, as any truthful query is considered undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Health concerns** The President's health may prevent him from enduring "hours of intense stress" associated with long public events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Security risks** Concerns over unidentified Ukrainian aircraft potentially penetrating Russian territory, especially near the Kremlin, pose a risk during public appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The President reportedly plans to celebrate New Year's deep underground, "beyond the Urals," for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Putin's Military Strategy Elements
Putin's military strategy towards Ukraine includes:
*   **Strategic Defensive** Russia has shifted to a strategic defensive posture since September, forming the "Surovikin line" to exhaust Ukrainian offensive capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Energy Infrastructure Destruction** Aims to demoralize Ukrainian society, disorganize its economy (especially military), and pressure the Ukrainian government to agree to terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This strategy also seeks to provoke immigration to Europe, causing discontent among Western governments and societies, thereby increasing pressure on Ukraine to negotiate a peace agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Russian Counter-offensive** Plans for a counter-offensive are being discussed, possibly targeting Kyiv or aiming to cut off Ukraine's weapon supply routes, potentially launched from Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Transformation into a Military Camp** Russia is being transformed into a military camp as a fundamental element of its military strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Western Peace Proposals and Their Motivations
Western calls for peace, notably from figures like Henry Kissinger, and statements from the US Secretary of State and former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, advocate for a return to pre-February 24th, 2022, conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This means Russia would give up newly acquired territories but retain Crimea and the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Kissinger's objective, shared by others, is to keep Russia engaged with Europe and inflict a military defeat without provoking Russian revanchism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

These peace plans are motivated by:
*   **Uncertainty of Military Actions** The "fog of war" means victory is not guaranteed, and the outcome is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Risk of Nuclear Escalation** The possibility of nuclear escalation is unfortunately not zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Human and Economic Pressure on Europe** Russia's energy war is increasing demographic pressure on Europe, and Europeans dislike suffering [[economic_challenges_in_russia | economic]] and financial losses from the protracted conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
*   **Threat of Russian Destabilization** A crushing military defeat of the Russian Federation, while possible, could lead to unpredictable political consequences and destabilization, posing a significant danger to Europe and the global order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Some Western forces aim to avoid extremes due to high risks outweighing benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## Resumption of Mobilization and Martial Law
Signs indicate the resumption of mobilization and the introduction of elements of martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Second Stage of Mobilization** A second, potentially more massive stage of mobilization is expected to begin in a relatively gentle form, possibly after the winter holidays, through "verification of documents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. A Moscow region military commissar's statement regarding an increase in military service term (to 1.5 or 2 years) from spring 2023, though denied by Putin, is seen as indicative of preparations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   **Extension of Martial Law** Martial law is likely to be extended to all or a significant part of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.
*   **Restrictions on Movement** Travel restrictions are being tested; employees of large corporations like Rostec and Rosneft, and their families, are prohibited from leaving the Russian Federation, with top management recommended not to leave Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. This is likened to a "secondary vision of serfdom" where state service entails attachment to the workplace and restrictions on movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. These restrictions are not expected to apply to "especially trusted oprichniks" (security forces) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

## [[economic_concerns_of_russian_citizens | Economic Concerns of Russian Citizens]] and Social Impact
The general population, referred to as "poor peasants," can expect further changes:
*   **Mobilization Economy** The logical step after martial law is a mobilization economy with attachment to the workplace, meaning people will not be able to quit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.
*   **Redistribution of Assets** Assets of "wrong oligarchs" (those critical of the state or unwilling to surrender capital for victory) will be transferred to the state or "right oligarchs" (patriots who suffered losses from sanctions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.
*   **Small and Medium-Sized Businesses** While direct nationalization is not planned, regional security agencies may target income-generating small and medium-sized businesses, potentially fabricating criminal cases to seize control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.
*   **Ideological Indoctrination** An "ideological pumping" or "people's war" concept may become central to propaganda efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. However, recent sociology suggests this is ineffective, with TV viewers largely refusing propaganda talk shows and switching to entertainment content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. People are tired of official propaganda's hysteria and want to forget about the conflict in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
*   **Poverty and Decreasing Incomes** Putin is seen as fighting "the poor" rather than poverty, as many poor people are mobilized and do not return, thus reducing the number of poor but lowering overall Russian incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.
    *   Sociology shows that 70% of citizens reduced expenses in Q3 2022, saving on clothes, eating out, household items, vacations, and new electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>.
    *   People plan to buy fewer and cheaper gifts for the New Year, indicating less money and a desire to save for a "real black day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.
*   **Suppression of Protests** Authorities have given orders to security forces to "mercilessly" suppress women's protests, as seen in Dagestan and Yakutia, echoing historical commands to "not fire blanks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

## Future Outlook
The current [[economic_and_political_situation_in_russia | economic and political situation in Russia]] suggests a future that is "even less pleasant than the present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. Despite the challenges, the speaker expresses conviction that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

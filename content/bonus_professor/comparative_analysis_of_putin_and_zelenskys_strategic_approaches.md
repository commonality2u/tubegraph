This article, based on a broadcast by [[Valery Soloveys analysis of Vladimir Putins presidency | Valery Solovey]], offers a comparative analysis of the strategic approaches of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in the ongoing [[Ukraine Russia conflict analysis | Ukraine-Russia conflict]].

## PR and Image Warfare

According to Solovey, President Zelensky has "completely outplayed" President Putin in the public relations (PR) sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. This advantage forces Putin to respond to Zelensky's "breakthrough image success" with his own PR efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. The initiative in the foreign policy arena, where reputation and image are formed, is currently with the Ukrainian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Despite Putin's "deep hatred and despise" for Zelensky, whom he considers a "Ukrainian clown," he is forced to follow Zelensky's lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

### Parallel Actions

Solovey highlights several instances where Putin's actions appear to mimic or respond to Zelensky's:
*   Zelensky visited Bakhmut, while Putin "allegedly" visited Rostov at the headquarters of the United Branches of the Armed Forces, though he was not actually there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
*   Zelensky awarded fighters on the front line, while Putin met with military personnel in a small Kremlin setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
*   Zelensky met with US President Biden in the US Congress, while Putin met with Belarusian President Lukashenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Notably, a double was allegedly used for Putin's appearance in Minsk to demonstrate "excellent physical condition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   Zelensky delivered a speech to the US Congress, while Putin spoke at the Ministry of Defense session, where "half a good half of my colleagues simply fell asleep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

Solovey concludes that "a copy is always worse than the original," leaving the audience to determine who is the "real leader" and who is a "pathetic plagiarism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

## Military and [[Russian political and military strategies | Strategic Preparations]]

Both sides are "preparing for a decisive battle" and concentrating forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

### Ukraine's Approach

Ukraine is expected to receive significant military aid from NATO countries and allies, including:
*   2,000 tanks and other armored vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>
*   More than 800 artillery systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>
*   Over 2 million shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>
*   Multiple launch rocket systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>

This equipment is intended for a "[[military_and_strategic_implications_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | strategic offensive]]" to reach Ukraine's state borders with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

### Russia's Approach

[[Putins strategy and plans regarding Ukraine | Russia]] is responding with several measures:
*   **Energy System Strikes:** Russia is striking Ukraine's energy system to de-energize the country, cause industrial disorganization, demoralize Ukrainian society, generate public pressure on Zelensky, and induce a new wave of emigration to European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   **Weapon Procurement:** Russia expects to receive new weapon systems, primarily ballistic missiles, from Iran. The head of Israeli intelligence, Mossad, publicly stated this for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. An initial batch of missiles is expected before the New Year, to be used shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
*   **Mobilization:**
    *   Russia is planning a new mobilization, focusing on "manpower" as a strategic bet, similar to the mid-20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
    *   The Kremlin believes a "quantitative advantage" is necessary for [[Putins strategic options in response to Western pressure | victory]] or "honorable peace terms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.
    *   This next stage of mobilization is expected soon after the New Year holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.
    *   Borders may be partially closed for those in the mobilization base, which is estimated to contain about 7 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.
    *   The goal is to mobilize 2 million people, including 300,000 women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.
    *   Mobilized personnel will likely be sent to the front line almost immediately after arriving at enlistment offices, with little or no preliminary training, due to lack of capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.
    *   Sociological data indicates that the [[Russian sociopolitical dynamics | Russian population]] is "resignedly" ready for mobilization, despite disliking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.
    *   Yevgeny Prigozhin has proposed recruiting prisoners, including those from women's colonies, and even patients from neuropsychiatric dispensaries for military roles, such as creating the "Surovikin line" of defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
*   **Offensive Plans:** After the "Surovikin line" ideally halts Ukraine's strategic offensive, Russia plans its own counteroffensive, potentially using Belarusian territory and other directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.

## [[Putins strategic options in response to Western pressure | Putin's Definition of Victory]]

A message from "comrade Xi" (likely referring to Chinese President Xi Jinping) reportedly laid out conditions for dialogue with Putin, requiring Russia to provide a plan for completing the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.

The message conveyed Putin's confidence in "final victory" to be achieved "no later than mid-summer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>. Victory, in this context, appears to mean "the acquisition of assignment or control over some other new territories and the exit to peace negotiations," suggesting a truce, ceasefire, or even a peace treaty by mid-summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>. Solovey expresses extreme doubt about this outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.

### Evolving War Aims

Putin initially stated the goals of the operation as "demilitarization" and "denazification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>. However, a new, globalist goal has emerged: "the unification of the Russian people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>. This goal implies uniting ethnic Russians living in Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and the Baltic countries with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>.

Solovey challenges this notion, stating that:
*   Putin "knows history very poorly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:34:00">[18:34:00]</a>.
*   Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians are "different peoples," despite close ethnic, cultural, linguistic, and historical ties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:36:00">[18:36:00]</a>.
*   Russia's actions, through "brotherly love with the help of missiles and artillery shells," have caused ethnic groups and those sympathetic to Russia to "flee from Russia like from a leper country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:23:00">[19:23:00]</a>.

This "fantastic" and "counterproductive" goal of unification is seen as causing wariness among sovereign countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:01:00">[20:01:00]</a>. Solovey asserts that Putin has led Russia into a "strategic trap" called [[Ukraine Russia conflict analysis | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>.

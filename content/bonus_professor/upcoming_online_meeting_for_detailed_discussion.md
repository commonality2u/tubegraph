Valery Solovey has announced an upcoming online meeting scheduled for April 13, 2023, at 8:00 p.m. Moscow time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The meeting aims to provide detailed insights and practical advice regarding the evolving political and social situation in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Overview
The online meeting will delve into the circumstances and dynamics of the current situation, which the speaker anticipates will develop "more alarmingly, faster, fleeting, and worse" than previously expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This includes potential widespread [[discussion_of_nuclear_weapons_usage | martial law]] across Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a> and the ongoing process described as "military serfdom" and "enslavement of the Russian population" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Purpose and Content
The core purpose of the meeting is to help attendees understand how to "survive the approaching era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, particularly in a state of "severe, constant, permanent stress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> where life, property, and savings are under increasing threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Key discussion points will include:
*   The reasons and circumstances behind the anticipated drastic changes in life and the country, comparable to those initiated on February 24, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   The dynamics expected to lead to a state of [[economic_issues_and_crisis_preparation | permanent stress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
*   Strategies to reduce stress levels and learn to live within this stressful environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.
*   Practical steps for navigating the challenges, such as dealing with potential blocking of accounts and bank cards, driver's licenses, and restrictions on civil and property rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
*   Advice on preserving property and modest funds, including managing cash, bank accounts, and businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that the information provided is "exclusive information of practical interest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, citing his track record of predictions and inside information coming true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. He highlights past warnings about border closures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, database formation, threats to property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, and the advice to buy dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, all of which have proven accurate.

## Access and Cost
The meeting is a paid event, with the fee described as "worth it" for the practical and exclusive information attendees will receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Links to connect to the meeting are provided in the description of the video and the first pinned comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Speaker's Emphasis on Practicality
Valery Solovey stresses that the primary goal is not to "fight or run," but to rationally and consistently "think about what and how can be done" to benefit oneself and loved ones, avoiding harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. He outlines two main priorities:
1.  **Preserving life and health** of oneself, family, and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
2.  **Preserving property** (modest savings, business) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

He warns that getting through the situation without losses is impossible, emphasizing that "losses are inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. All other tasks, such as apartment repairs or vacation planning, are secondary to these two main objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. He advises forgetting secondary needs due to limited time and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Inevitable Losses
> "To get out of what we are facing without losses, none of us will be able to do it individually and no family. So thank God if he takes only money and wasted nerves, they with lives, injuries and illnesses. Accept the losses are inevitable." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>

Regarding [[discussion_on_the_recruitment_and_military_strategy_in_Russia | mobilization]], the speaker notes that the unified register of military personnel and online summonses are not yet fully operational and are expected by fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. However, he warns against complacency, stating that summonses can still be issued via existing integrated databases, and there will be no 20-day grace period as suggested by recent legislation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
He also suggests having a lawyer's contact readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>, particularly for business-related issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. The importance of calmness and having a "safe haven" with "reliable friends or an extensive family" is also highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The current situation in Belarus is characterized by significant unrest and millions participating in rallies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Many European countries, including Ukraine, have not recognized the election results, and Ukraine officially did not congratulate Lukashenko on his victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The ongoing events are described as a revolution, not merely unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. However, it is believed that the [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_the_fate_of_lukashenko | revolution]] is reaching a dead end, as the impulse of Belarusians is insufficient to overthrow Lukashenko and achieve a decisive victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Proposed Compromise and Future of Lukashenko

A compromise is considered the most likely outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The formula for this compromise was reportedly discussed during telephone conversations between Putin and Lukashenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

The proposed compromise outlines the following:
*   Lukashenko would remain the president of Belarus for no longer than one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   After this period, he would announce early presidential elections following the adoption of a new constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   During this transitional period, Lukashenko must sign a new union treaty with [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   Lukashenko would not contest the early presidential elections, and Babarika, considered a candidate favorable to Moscow, would run instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   This arrangement would provide Belarus with a new, non-authoritarian president, while [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | Russia]] would resolve its issue of control over Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   Lukashenko would move to Moscow and become secretary of the new State Council, a body expected to be created in [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

In the event of very strong pressure on Lukashenko (which is not yet observed), early elections might be held sooner, possibly this year, but with the same intended results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Putin's statement about [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | Russia]] preparing reserves to help Lukashenko is interpreted as a desire to compel the Belarusian opposition and society to negotiate this compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Despite Lukashenko's public stance that he will never voluntarily leave his position because he believes he was elected by his people, and that only being killed could remove him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, it is suggested that if he becomes an insurmountable obstacle to [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | Russian]] control over Belarus, he could face "troubles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. His confidence in his ability to survive is considered an exaggeration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## External Factors and International Reactions

While Lukashenko claims an external factor influences the rallies, this is seen as secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. A group of American political technology consultants in Warsaw are attempting to aid the opposition, but their role is not decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The revolution is not provoked from the outside, similar to the "Revolution of Dignity" which was not provoked by Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The European Union, for instance, sought a compromise with Yanukovych <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. While external intervention exists, it is not the key factor in the dynamics of events; the primary influence remains the [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | Russian]] Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

Regarding Putin's statement about [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | Russia]] having prepared reserves to assist Lukashenko, this is seen as a warning or rhetorical figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]]]>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Neither Putin nor Lukashenko desires the use of force, as it would severely damage relations between Russians and Belarusians, similar to how it has poisoned relations between Russians and Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Putin previously informed Merkel that [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | Russia]] would not introduce armed forces into Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The "reserve" mentioned by Putin refers to the "force of the Cross Guard and OMON," not the army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Currently, there are approximately 200-300 Rosguard members in Belarus, primarily former Ukrainian Berkut fighters who fled in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Belarus's Independence Post-Lukashenko

If Belarus signs the proposed union treaty, it would effectively transform into a "western province of the [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | Russian]] Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Belarus would lose 95% of its national powers in favor of the union state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Impact on Donbass Negotiations

Currently, there is no discussion of changing the negotiating platform for Donbass, and Minsk remains the main platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. However, in extreme cases, the negotiations could be transferred and restored in Almaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | Russian]] delegation is likely to be strengthened by the return of Vladislav Surkov to the Ukrainian direction of [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | Russian]] policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This return is intended to intensify the negotiating process, which is currently at a dead end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Although the Kremlin is confident in its ability to influence Yermak and his deputy, the Ukrainian side's refusal to comply with previously reached agreements led to Putin's strong dissatisfaction with Surkov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Despite Putin's dislike for "circus," Surkov's involvement is considered necessary in the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Broader Geopolitical Context

The determining factor in the future relations between Belarus, Ukraine, and [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | Russia]] will be a coming crisis within the [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | Russian]] Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. It is anticipated that a very powerful and [[possibility_of_revolution_and_political_crisis_in_russia | radical political crisis]] will develop in [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | Russia]], altering its relationship with its neighbors, particularly Ukraine and Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. In essence, [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | Russia]] will be preoccupied with its internal problems and the departure of Putin, leading to new leadership, a new agenda, and a new style of relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

### Public Discontent in Russia

Putin's apparent indifference to the [[protests_and_public_dissent_in_russia | people of the Russian Federation]], as evidenced by the Khabarovsk protests, is attributed to his fatigue and declining health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. This contrasts with his past efforts to conceal his true attitude towards [[social_unrest_and_public_dissatisfaction_in_russia | Russian]] society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. The Kremlin is greatly concerned about [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | political unrest]] and [[protests_and_public_dissent_in_russia | mass protests]] expected in the fall or early next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. There is an active effort to eliminate potential leaders capable of heading these protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

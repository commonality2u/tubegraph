The Western response to events in Ukraine has included imposing sanctions on Russian oligarchs, a move framed as an "economic war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[0:17:27]</a>. This strategy appears to be a "last chance" for these influential figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[0:00:18]</a>, with a clear differentiation in the West's approach to various individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[0:04:28]</a>.

## Initial Sanctions and Differentiated Approach

The Russian oligarchy, particularly figures associated with President Putin's inner circle, has been significantly impacted by sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[0:01:24]</a>. The USA, for example, included almost all major figures in its sanctions lists, including Usmanov and Mordashov, and the standard circle of Putin's entourage such as Timchenko and Berg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[0:01:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[0:01:43]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[0:01:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[0:01:54]</a>.

However, a "differentiated approach" is evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[0:04:28]</a>. While some, like Timchenko, Rotenberg, and Kovalchuk, are met with merciless Western action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[0:04:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[0:04:38]</a>, others, particularly those from "old school" or "old families" connected to the Yeltsin era, have been given some leeway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[0:02:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[0:02:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[0:02:13]</a>. This flexibility is believed to provide an opportunity for them to "decide the issue" internally, possibly by influencing Putin and the conflict in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[0:03:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[0:04:09]</a>.

## Targeted Individuals and Their Situations

*   **Roman Abramovich:** Was not formally included in initial US sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[0:02:47]</a>. He was reportedly offered to sell assets from Great Britain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[0:02:53]</a> and is involved in attempts to establish negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. He also promised charitable assistance to Ukraine, intending to transfer money from the sale of British assets to a recovery fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Alisher Usmanov:** Faced widespread American sanctions, though not all of his companies or assets were immediately frozen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Britain introduced personal sanctions against him, confiscating real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Arkady Rotenberg:** Reportedly participated in consultations with Western intelligence agencies in May of the previous year (2021) regarding transit and potential liberal changes in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. However, this initiative did not materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Alfa Group and Petr Aven:** Were unable to resolve issues related to entry or sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

Oligarchs attempted to influence the situation by spending "hundreds of millions of pounds" to avoid sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The inability to enter Europe or Great Britain greatly complicates their personal and business situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Evolving Influence and Response

While these oligarchs were once very close to Putin, even personally overseeing projects like an underground passage for Alina Kabaeva's school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, their closeness has diminished over the past two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Putin now communicates with a limited number of people, such as Kovalchuk, Rotenberg, and Demchenko, but not many of the older oligarchs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

There is a perceived "non-aggression pact" between the old elite and the government: if the elite does not attack, finance opposition, or engage in investing, Putin will not target them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. However, these oligarchs are now politically helpless, despite their vast wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. They cannot easily reach Putin or exert influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

Some oligarchs, such as Deripaska and Lukoil, have made public statements, indicating a collective voice against the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. However, any elite actions, including potential conspiracies or coups, would only be successful if synchronized with popular movements "from below" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Since there are no more independent media or alternative points of view in Russia, their instruments of influence have disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>.

## Future of Sanctions

The West is expected to continue increasing pressure, with sanctions likely to spread "both in breadth and in depth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>. This means targeting not only second-row oligarchs (those with fortunes around a billion dollars who were less politically visible) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>, but also officials and their family relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:25">[00:24:25]</a>.

The goal of the sanctions is to reduce Russia's economic power, potentially by half, making it a "broken trough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. This is seen as an unprecedented achievement in economic history, self-inflicted by Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>.

Even if escalation stops, current sanctions are unlikely to be lifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. The prevailing logic is that new sanctions would be withheld if escalation ceases, but existing ones would remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. This approach aims to maintain pressure and further isolate the regime.

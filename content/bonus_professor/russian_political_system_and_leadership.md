Valery Solovey presents the 25th episode of the "Answers to Hot Questions" program, airing on Thursday, July 13th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This episode addresses questions submitted by viewers under a previously released video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Current Leadership Dynamics

### Alleged Putin-Prigozhin Meeting
Contrary to statements by President Putin's press secretary Peskov, there was no meeting between [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Putin]] and Prigozhin and Wagner private military company commanders on June 29, nor was it planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The Kremlin reportedly intends to present fake documents, including photos and videos, depicting a staging with a [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Putin]] double and Wagner commanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Role of Putin's Doubles
The use of doubles is considered a process of "delegitimization of power," causing authorities to lose trust and belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. The [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Russian political elite]] is reportedly aware of [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Putin's]] widespread use of doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The next step in this delegitimization is in the eyes of Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

Doubles appeared at least in the second decade of the 21st century and began to be used more intensively after the Crimean epic in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Their use became even more intensive from 2020, with the intention of replacing the current president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. While it's possible doubles might temporarily replace [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Putin]], this period would be short-lived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Recruited doubles were promised their original appearance would be restored via plastic surgery and a large sum of money upon completion of their duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

Regarding [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Putin's]] health, it allows him to engage in audio communication, such as talking to Macron, which is considered a "gentle measure in terms of health" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### Operational Management of the Country
If the president is currently weak, the highest officials carry out the operational management of the country and make important current decisions within their competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Key Figures and Their Roles
*   **Sergei Ivanov:** Plays no important role in the existing ruling elite and has no special influence on [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Prosecutor General Krasnov:** His speech at a Security Council meeting before the special military operation was cut because he was considered "a hawk unacceptable even by Kremlin standards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Two video versions of the meeting were prepared: one with Krasnov's "very tough, even cruel" speech and one without it, which aired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Prime Minister Mishustin:** [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Putin]] regards him as a "good, obedient, loyal technocrat" and is not afraid of him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Mishustin lacks political ambitions and resources to realize any, and would be declared incompetent to become the successor to the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs:** Currently carries out a "decorative function" and is primarily for propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Oligarchs (Rotenberg, Kovalchuk, Timchenko):** All are currently in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>.
*   **Viktor Medvedchuk and Yanukovych:** Described as "policemen and corpses" (in a figurative sense for their political influence), with Yanukovych also being seriously ill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. They are not being prepared for any role in the country's political process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. The idea of using Medvedchuk for the "new territories" of Ukraine has not worked out well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

### [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Russian Political Elite]] and Power Dynamics
[[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Patrushev's group elite]] is not seizing power because they are afraid of each other, leading to mutual paralysis where no one dares to take the first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. However, Prigozhin's actions have expanded the framework, showing an opportunity for movement, and "decisive movements" are expected by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

## [[Future political leadership in Russia | Future Political Leadership and Governance]]

### Expectations for a New Government
There are forces in Russia interested in the prosperity of the Motherland and its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Such people exist even within the [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Russian government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. These forces also connect the future of the country with the development of intellectual potential, science, industry, education, and medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

The only guarantee that adequate people will come to power and avoid resource exploitation is the public's direct participation in the political crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This public involvement and control are essential to ensure the new government's course is implemented in society's interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

One of the primary tasks of a new government will be secondary industrialization and starting production where possible, ensuring continued work for those in manufacturing and aviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Constitutional and Governmental Restructuring
The speaker's group aims to establish a new Russian Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. It is not feasible to immediately transition Russia to a parliamentary republic as it lacks a full-fledged parliament and parties, which would take 10-12 years to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. Therefore, the new constitution will include transitional provisions, likely establishing a presidential republic with restrictions for an estimated 10-12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. After this period, a referendum will be held to determine if Russia should be a parliamentary or presidential republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

The revelation of the current regime's intricacies after its departure will not undermine the people's desire to participate in politics; on the contrary, it will strengthen it by showing the government's capacity for self-purification and a commitment to avoid past mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

### Judicial Reform
Russia urgently needs judicial reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The project for this reform has been developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. Key aspects include:
*   **Broadest amnesty with rehabilitation:** Up to a quarter of people in prison are estimated to be there on illegal charges or should not be there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **Lustration of the judicial corps:** This will be done completely and unconditionally, without any exceptions, gradually but fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   **Changes to the judicial system** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

### Migrants and Ethnic Criminal Groups
The problem of migrants and ethnic criminal groups is considered solvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. The solution requires "goal-setting" and "political will," with the technology for solving it already known globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Goal-setting means migrants would only be allowed in Russia where needed by the economy and society, and in quantities not exceeding needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.

### Military and Conflict Considerations
Some forces planning to come to power after [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Putin]] are ready to quickly end the armed conflict with Ukraine, while others are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. There is a possibility that if the Ukrainian offensive is defeated, the Russian armed forces could go on a counteroffensive, as Russia's military and defense industry potential should not be underestimated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

The speaker notes that the forecast of an impressive Ukrainian counteroffensive and the end of [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Putin]] by fall 2023, while not yet fully realized, is underway, and the counteroffensive's scale will grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. Friendship between Russia and Ukraine is unlikely, but pragmatic relations can be built relatively quickly, "absolutely definitely in our lifetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

The future of South Ossetia and Abkhazia will be decided after the end of the [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | political crisis in Russia]], through difficult political negotiations with all interested parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

### Symbols of the State
The question of changing the Russian flag after a change in leadership has no definite answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>. The current flag could be kept, similar to how Germany retained its national flag despite its difficult history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Alternatively, a new flag, like that of the Russian ship *Orel* from the time of Alexei Mikhailovich, could be adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.

### Dealing with Disinformation and Public Opinion
It is considered incorrect and counterproductive to argue with people who hold opposite views, even with facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. In Russia, the overwhelming majority of people are "designed" to learn only through their own "cruel mistakes, deprivation of losses," and sometimes even this personal experience is not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Efforts to convince them should be made, but a positive result should not be expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### The Lenin Mummy
The Lenin mummy in the mausoleum has never played and will not play any mystical role in modern power and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. It remains unburied for "purely political, pragmatic reasons," serving as a potential false target to distract the electorate from unpleasant events if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### Future Outlook
The speaker emphasizes that the current laws regarding foreign agents "will not work for long" and expects them to no longer be observed by the end of the year, with initiators facing legal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The speaker expresses certainty that "we are on the right path" and victory will be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.

> [!INFO] Financial Advice
> For personal savings, especially for a dignified old age, holding cash is unproductive due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. The advice is to acquire foreign currency if possible, as the banking system in Russia could develop rapidly after the crisis, allowing for currency deposits or conversion to rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. Real estate is also considered a good idea for passive income through renting, though it requires a very long payback horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Return to Russia
> Deciding to return to Russia depends on individual temperament and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. If one wishes to participate in future events, returning in the fall might be planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. If one prefers to save themselves for a "beautiful Russia of the future," then waiting is advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

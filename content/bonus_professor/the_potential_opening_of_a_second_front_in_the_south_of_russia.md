## Overview
While a potential "second front" conflict was discussed in the context of Lithuania and Belarus, a different "second front" could open from Russia's southern borders, specifically related to Tajikistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This possibility is linked to the activities of the Taliban <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

## Background: Kremlin's Deal with the Taliban
Reports suggest that the Taliban, an organization deemed extremist in Russia, had initially calmed down their activities due to receiving compensation from the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This compensation allegedly amounted to 5 billion dollars, provided partly in cash and partly through oil supplies, petroleum products, and various equipment, with the aim of preventing the Taliban from invading Tajikistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This payment indicates the Kremlin's desire to avoid conflict in this region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

## Reasons for Russia's Concern
There are two primary reasons why Russia seeks to prevent a conflict involving Tajikistan:
1.  **Concentration in Ukraine**: Russia has focused all its military efforts on the western direction in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
2.  **CSTO Obligations**: Tajikistan and Russia are members of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. If aggression were committed against Tajikistan, Russia, as a CSTO member, would be obligated to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. However, Russia's military resources are reportedly limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Failure to intervene could lead to the collapse of the CSTO itself due to its perceived uselessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

## Renewed Threat of a Southern Front
Despite the previous payments, there are indications that Western countries, no longer considered partners by Russia, are actively working with the Taliban to potentially instigate a strike against Tajikistan in August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This action aims to open a "Second Front" in the south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. While the success of these negotiations is uncertain, efforts to push the Taliban in this direction are definitely underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Potential Timing
The potential opening of this southern front in August aligns with statements from the head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Budanov, who indicated expectations of "turning points" during that month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This could refer not only to the supply of new weapons to Ukraine but also to the hypothetical opening of a second front on Russia's southern borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:14:04]</a>.

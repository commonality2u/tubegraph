The [[current_phase_of_the_russian_ukraine_conflict | military and political dynamics between Russia and Ukraine]] in the past week have shown significant developments, though not necessarily leading to a [[strategic_turning_point_in_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]] for either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Key Developments and Outcomes

### Russian Military and Symbolic Success
The surrender of the Azovstal fighters is regarded as a military and important symbolic success for the Russian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. However, this success does not represent a [[strategic_turning_point_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]] in the "special military operation" or the armed confrontation between [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Russia and Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### Ukrainian Counteroffensive
In contrast, Ukrainian troops successfully carried out a counteroffensive, pushing Russian forces away from Kharkiv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Fierce battles continue on the Seversky Donets, where Russian efforts are not expected to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Fate of Azovstal Fighters
Two main options are anticipated for the Azovstal fighters:
*   **Public Trial:** For those affiliated with the Azov regiment, which Russia has declared extremist and a "Nazi regiment," a public trial is planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This is intended to demonstrate the "denazification" demands with which Russia began its operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Prisoner Exchange:** Fighters not associated with the Azov regiment will likely be exchanged for Russian prisoners of war at an undetermined time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The decision for exchange will be made personally by the President of the Russian Federation, guided by political expediency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Shifting Russian Strategy
While both sides remain in a positional fight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, signs appeared last week that the Russian Federation is increasingly focusing on consolidating the current status quo rather than achieving a [[strategic_turning_point_in_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This involves legalizing the territorial gains made over the past three months through negotiations with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Symptoms of This Shift
*   **Revival of Russian Agents of Influence:** There has been a resurgence of Russian agents of influence in European Union countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
    *   Former Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi, described as a personal friend of Putin, publicly urged Europe to persuade Ukraine to accept Russia's conditions for negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. These conditions include recognition of Crimea as Russian, Donbass as independent, and Russian control over Kherson and parts of Zaporizhzhya regions, forming a land bridge to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
    *   The Italian Foreign Ministry sent a proposal to end the conflict, which, while not as overtly pro-Russian as Berlusconi's, could still benefit Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   French and German politicians have also implicitly or explicitly called for peace with Ukraine "here and now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Reasons for European Push for Peace
Several factors contribute to these European calls for peace:
*   **Russian Leverage:** Russia is believed to have leverage and influence over certain European politicians, including Macron and Schulz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Fear of Escalation:** European leaders fear conflict escalation, not only due to the open question of non-conventional weapon use but also the inevitable increase in refugees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Approximately six million Ukrainian refugees are already outside Ukraine, posing a significant financial and social burden on the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Global Famine Threat:** The conflict severely limits Ukraine's ability to export grain, raising concerns about a global famine due to disrupted logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Russian propaganda and officials actively exploit this threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Ukraine's Position and International Support
Ukraine, led by President Zelensky, insists that the outcome will be achieved on the battlefield, aiming for peace negotiations once a military advantage is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This stance is primarily supported by the "Anglo-Saxon duo" (Great Britain and the United States), as well as Poland and the Baltic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

The United States has reportedly cautioned Chancellor Schulz and Macron to adhere to Euro-Atlantic solidarity and NATO's course of unconditional support for Ukraine, implying pressure to continue the war to a victorious end for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

### Ukraine's Far-Reaching Plans
Ukraine is increasingly counting on a [[strategic_turning_point_in_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]] through technological and military superiority, facilitated by Western assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. While precise timing is uncertain, a counteroffensive is likely by late summer or early autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Ukraine's far-reaching plans include restoring the territorial status quo from before February 24, and potentially reclaiming Donbass and Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

This intention causes tension on the Russian side, as evidenced by Russian propaganda statements warning of disaster if Ukraine crosses the Russian border, implying that all of Russia's territorial achievements could be reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Realistically thinking parts of the Russian military are aware of the potential loss of new territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Russian Consolidation of Occupied Territories
Upon acquiring new territories, Russia immediately begins constructing defensive fortifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Despite official claims that places like Kherson are "forever with Russia," such statements are noted to be historically unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

The vice-premier responsible for construction, Khusnullin, benefits from the "gold mine" of restoring infrastructure in places like Mariupol, Kherson, and Donbass, which involves colossal budget financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. There is skepticism regarding the permanence of these construction efforts and the stability of the new status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

## Internal Discontent in Russia
The failure of Russia's import substitution program, which received gigantic funding over 14 years, has led to discontent within the KGB lobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Senator Klishas, a representative of this lobby, publicly stated the program failed, attributing it to serving personal and group interests rather than national ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This signifies growing dissatisfaction with Putin's trust in certain individuals, indicating that the system, centered around him, is becoming turbulent as he weakens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

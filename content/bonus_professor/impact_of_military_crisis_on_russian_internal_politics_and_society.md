Valery Solovyov discusses the escalating military actions and their profound implications for internal Russian politics and society, following Russia's rejection of a peace proposal and subsequent missile strikes on Ukraine. He notes that the immediate reaction seen suggests that the incident in Poland, involving missiles, is unlikely to become a *casus belli* or trigger NATO's Article 5, as no one in NATO appears interested in activating it at this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Escalation of Military Action

The rejection of a peace proposal by President Putin on November 15, 2022, was signaled by an unprecedentedly large-scale missile strike on Ukrainian infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. This signifies an escalation of military action to a new, more dangerous phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

### Ukrainian Response
As a result of Russia's categorical rejection of peace, Ukraine is expected to receive new, longer-range weapons and ammunition, including missiles and drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This will extend the zone of destruction for Ukrainian armed forces to include not only border regions but also areas deeper within Russia, potentially reaching Central Russia, with this radius expected to expand over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

On November 15, the Secretary of the Security Council, Nikolai Patrushev, was reportedly sent to inspect the air defense system in Central Russia to assess its readiness against new challenges and threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Recent incidents include the undermining of a steel oil depot in the Varlovskaya region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. Ukraine is also expected to launch new offensives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.

### Russian Strategy
Russia is expected to continue massive shelling, provided it has sufficient missiles or receives them from its strategic allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. However, a major offensive or counteroffensive by Russian armed forces in Ukraine is deemed unlikely, as Russia has adopted a concept of strategic defense using mobilized protective contingents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

## [[impact_of_political_changes_in_russia | Internal Changes within Russia]]

The ongoing military crisis is expected to lead to significant [[impact_of_political_actions_on_russian_society_and_economy | internal changes]] within Russia.

### [[impact_of_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | Mobilization]]
Despite presidential announcements, the formal document ending mobilization has not been submitted, leading to continued calls from military enlistment offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. A second stage of mobilization is reportedly scheduled for after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. If Ukrainian offensives are successful, this second stage may be accelerated, with currently trained mobilized personnel sent to the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. This next phase will likely be termed "additional mobilization" or "completion of partial mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.

### [[impact_of_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | Martial Law and Civil Liberties]]
Martial law, currently applied to the "new territories" of Ukraine, may be extended to Russian regions bordering Ukraine, and potentially to major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. This extension would involve further restrictions on civil liberties, including freedom of movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.

Military-civilian administrations or military commandants could gain special rights, including the ability to detain citizens without trial for 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. They could also confiscate property, such as vehicles or equipment, from citizens and enterprises if deemed necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. Curfews may also be introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

### Economic Impact
The economy is expected to undergo further "non-stateization and mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>. Currently, up to 40% of the Russian economy is connected to the "special military operation," a share that is likely to increase due to insufficient Russian resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:11:00]</a>.

### [[impact_of_political_actions_on_russian_society_and_economy | Political Stability and Outlook]]
Closed polls indicate that Putin's popularity is declining rapidly, and while not as rapid, protest moods are growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. The authorities are expected to react by "tightening the screws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. However, this could lead to the collapse of the "Russian statehood" structure, which is already showing signs of weakening, evidenced by the behavior of figures like Kadyrov, who operates outside the conventional Russian legal framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.

The military confrontation is inevitably developing into a [[russian_political_crisis_and_power_transition | political crisis]], which will be large-scale and acute, potentially leading to a colossal crisis and even the collapse of Russian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>. This does not imply Russia's disappearance but rather a significant transformation into a [[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_russia | profound crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>.

> "The military crisis that Russia is drawn into is a confrontation that is developing into a military crisis, this crisis will inevitably develop into a political crisis, a large-scale and acute crisis, so all this will lead to a colossal crisis, and possibly to the collapse of Russian statehood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a>

Putin's personal strategy involves escalation—raising the stakes—as the only way to force the West to retreat and pressure Ukraine into a peace agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. However, the West is not expected to retreat; instead, it will increase pressure on Russia through Ukraine and other means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. Russia, based on its combined power, is seen as unable to withstand the pressure of the consolidated West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>.

## Coming Dark Times

The "flip side" of this military crisis will be an [[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_russia | economic crisis]] and a financial crisis, alongside the [[russian_political_crisis_and_power_transition | political crisis]] and a crisis of Russian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.

The speaker predicts the coming of "darkest times" for Russia, not just of the last 20 years, but potentially comparable in scale to historical events about a hundred years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a>. Historical analogies include the Crimean War (1853-1856), the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and the First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. The outcome is not expected to be the same as the Crimean War, which stimulated positive changes despite a shameful exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>.

The period ahead is considered to be the "darkest time of Russian history" in the 21st century, possibly extending from the end of the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:25:00">[19:25:00]</a>. In terms of consequences and scale, the speaker believes it will be comparable to the events of 1990-1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:35:00">[19:35:00]</a>.

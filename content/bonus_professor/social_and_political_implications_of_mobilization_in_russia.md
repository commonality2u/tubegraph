From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The possibility of [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]] in the Russian Federation became a central topic of discussion by May 6 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This discussion emerged as the special military operation entered a positional phase, characterized by skirmishes and slow advancements rather than large-scale operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Current State of the Conflict and Resource Needs

Both the Russian and Ukrainian sides retain the intention of achieving a strategic turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. For Ukraine, this intention is supported by Western allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, ensuring an uninterrupted supply of military and technical resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Ukraine's ability to resist skillfully and potentially go on the counteroffensive depends on moral, psychological, and societal resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Russian military policy aimed to deplete Ukraine's resources and demoralize Ukrainian society to force a peace treaty on Russia's terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. However, this goal has not been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, and a strategic turning point for Russia remains elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

In contrast to Ukraine, Russia has limited military resources, with no external support for military aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. There are "many questions" regarding the moral and psychological state of the Russian armed forces and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The stated goals of the operation have shifted multiple times, from "denazification" and "demilitarization" of Ukraine to the more modest objective of controlling Donbass and the Azov and Black Sea coasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Even these limited military goals are doubted by some high-ranking Russian military leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## The Impetus for Mobilization

Given the stalled conflict and limited resources, two tools are considered to achieve a strategic turning point for Russia: crushing Ukraine with human mass through [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]] of human resources, or inflicting tactical nuclear strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Official Preparedness vs. Public Perception

Discussions about [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]] began almost immediately after the special military operation commenced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The Security Council, under Nikolai Patrushev, reported to Putin that everything is organizationally and technically ready for [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, and that "political negative consequences mass [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]] will not entail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

However, the actual readiness of Russian society for [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]] and public willingness to participate can only be checked practically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Arguments that [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]] is technically infeasible, organizationally impractical, or politically unprofitable for Putin are dismissed as "zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. These arguments echo those made before February 24, when experts claimed a conflict with Ukraine was impossible because it was "categorically unprofitable for Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

### Putin's Rationale for Mobilization

> [!CAUTION] Putin's Logic
> The logic guiding Vladimir Putin is fundamentally different from that of external experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. While appearing irrational to some, Putin's decisions are very rational within his own worldview and based on premises that others might find strange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. His views on history significantly influence his political decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

## The Decision and Potential Implementation

A decision regarding [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]] has been made by the President of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This decision, however, is not guaranteed to be implemented, and its timing is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. May 9th was discussed as an option but was not designated as the start date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

### Scale and Methods

It is planned to mobilize about half a million people in several stages (3-4 stages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The methods for compelling [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]] include:
*   Military registration and enlistment office employees visiting homes, potentially accompanied by police officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   Blocking bank cards of those subject to [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   Closing borders for those subject to [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
Anyone with a military ID between the ages of 17 and 50 is theoretically subject to [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Justifying Mobilization

[[mobilization_process_in_Russia | Mobilization]] must be preceded by events that justify its necessity from a propaganda perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. These justifying actions would aim to demonstrate that Ukraine poses an "existential threat" to the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Such events could include:
*   Chemical attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   Terrorist attacks in large Russian cities, including Moscow and St. Petersburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
These events would serve as a pretext to declare that the homeland is in danger, shifting the conflict's status from a "special military operation" to a "full-fledged and large-scale war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## Potential Consequences

### War Status and Nuclear Weapons

Elevating the conflict to a full-scale war would simultaneously legitimize the possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. The rationale would be that if Ukraine poses an existential threat, it must be "destroyed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. The idea of nuclear strikes, even tactical ones, is considered plausible, drawing a parallel to the unexpected start of the special military operation on February 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

### Public and Elite Reactions

The chances of preventing [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]] are slim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. However, if there is widespread critical discussion and negative public sentiment towards [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]], reports from the Federal Security Service (FSB) to Putin might make him aware of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] Individual Strategies
> For individuals, the speaker suggests exploring "individual strategies for salvation" to avoid [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. More specific hints and tips are promised in a subsequent program episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

There are signs of psychological distress within the Russian elite, including "hysterical statements" from TV presenters and media figures, and "amazing in its cynicism and baseness of statements" from a minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. These indicate that "despair and anger are spread in the air" in the Russian Federation, characterizing the atmosphere at both the bottom and the top of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

## Conclusion

The speaker emphasizes the importance of mutual aid and supporting those who "preserve... dignity, moral values, our image and common sense" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Despite the "unpleasant and monstrous" things discussed, the speaker asserts that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. Further legal aspects of [[legal_grounds_for_mobilization_in_Russia | mobilization]] are expected to be covered in a future broadcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

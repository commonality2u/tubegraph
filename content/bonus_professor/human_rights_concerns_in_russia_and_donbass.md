The following article summarizes the insights and analysis from Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, episode 42 of "What's Happening," recorded on December 8th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This episode provides a response to the Russian President's speech before the Council on Human Rights and Civil Society Development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Human Rights Concerns in Russia and Donbass

#### The Human Rights Council and Presidential Address
On December 7th, the Russian President spoke before the Council on Human Rights and Civil Society Development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The speaker notes that this body is "specially selected," with "potential troublemakers" having been removed in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. The list of questions presented to the President was pre-approved by the administration and personally by the President himself, ensuring no "uncomfortable and disturbing" inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

#### Putin's Perception of Human Rights
The President stated that the international doctrine of human rights is used to "destroy the sovereignty of states" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. However, the speaker questions this, noting that fundamental rights such as free elections, separation of powers, freedom of movement, and property inviolability are cornerstones of this doctrine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. It is argued that these freedoms only threaten states whose foundations are built on "the power of criminals, thieves, and bandits," as these states see human rights as a direct challenge and threat to their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

#### Rights of Donbass Residents and Russia's "National Interests"
The President claimed that the rights of Donbass residents were violated, and they were considered "second-class people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. He suggested that Russia itself is viewed as a "second-class country" with no right to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The stated response from Russia is a "consistent struggle for their [[russian_nationalism_and_political_tensions | national interests]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

The speaker critically examines what Russia is defending internally, pointing out that 25% of Russian toilets are outdoors, vast territories are "emptying and dying," and pensioners receive "tiny pensions" which make a decent lifestyle "impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The Special Military Operation has caused the population to "die faster than before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

Regarding Donbass, it is noted that despite claims of bringing "happiness and prosperity" to the region since 2014, at least 1.5 million people (possibly 2 million) have left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. The President's question, "Where were you in 2014?" is countered by the speaker, who states that it would have cost significantly less to evacuate millions from Donbass than the ongoing Special Military Operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The speaker also highlights a logical inconsistency: if human rights undermine sovereignty, why should the rights of Donbass residents undermine Ukraine's sovereignty, while Russia's sovereignty is protected? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

#### Contradictory Narratives on Conflict Origins and International Relations
The President reiterated the long-standing narrative that the war was not started by Russia but by Ukrainian authorities after the 2014 "coup d'Ã©tat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This is a main point of Russian propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. However, the speaker contrasts this with statements from Igor Strelkov (Girkin), who openly claims he "began the war in Donbass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

The President also claimed that a Polish nationalist group desires to take western Ukrainian territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. The speaker dismisses this as a "statement of marginal groups," comparing it to Russian State Duma deputies who demand Alaska be returned to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Poland, by contrast, has been a major sponsor of Ukraine, providing military and humanitarian aid, and accepting the most Ukrainian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. No Polish public or state official has made territorial claims on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

Paradoxically, the President asserted that Russia is the "only guarantor of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, despite launching a "special military operation" that has incorporated new territories into Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This is compared to Russia's role as a guarantor of Ukraine's security under the Budapest Memorandum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

#### The Rights of Russians and the War Effort
While deeming human rights a "dangerous subversive concept," the President believes Russia needs to protect the rights of Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. However, the speaker points to deficiencies in protecting the rights of the mobilized. The President expressed surprise at ongoing problems with equipment for mobilized personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, which the speaker attributes to "enemies" who have "penetrated" the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

Furthermore, issues regarding the rehabilitation of wounded military and civilians in the special military operation zone are only now being discussed, over nine months after the conflict began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This highlights a lack of "promptness of the response of the Russian authorities" to the needs of those involved in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

#### The Economic Impact of the Special Military Operation
The Special Military Operation absorbs a quarter of the Russian Federation's budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. This financial drain directly impacts the rights and welfare of ordinary Russians:
*   New hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>
*   Pension increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>
*   Social payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>
*   Maternity capital increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>

All these funds are diverted to "guns, shells, artillery shots," and the production of military equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. Furthermore, 1.5 million sets of uniforms have disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. The speaker also notes that 200 billion of the 300 billion in Russian reserves frozen in Europe are missing, implying they were "stolen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

The "achievement" of the operation is the Sea of Azov becoming an "inland sea of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. However, the speaker contrasts this with Russia's vast, underdeveloped territories where "millions of people live without gasification," lack clean water, and still need indoor toilets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. The speaker argues Russia should focus on putting its own land in order, which would naturally attract others, rather than exporting violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.

#### The President's Mental State and Its [[russian_political_situation_and_governance_issues | Impact on Governance]]
The speaker concludes that the President believes his own contradictory statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. All "inconsistencies" and "illogicality" are ignored in his mind, where "everything is consistent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. This type of thinking is characterized as being "classified as medicine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>, reflecting the opening quote: "What do you want from a sick mind?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. The core issue is that this individual is governing Russia, leading to "grief and misfortune" for both Russia and its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

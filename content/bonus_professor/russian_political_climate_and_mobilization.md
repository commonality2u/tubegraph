## Valery Solovyov's YouTube Channel
Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel hosts "Answers to Hot Questions," with the sixth episode recorded at noon on Thursday, December 1st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The speaker noted fewer questions but more flattering letters from viewers who had changed their skeptical views, appreciating the "flexibility of intellect" shown in rethinking situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. He lamented that this quality is "not in favor among our people," who resist change, adhering to their positions as part of their identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## New Legal Disclaimers
A new law came into force on December 1, requiring longer disclaimers for video content, including an "over 18 years of age" warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The speaker expressed hope that these disclaimers would not eventually take up several minutes of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## [[Mobilization process in Russia | Mobilization in Russia]]
A viewer from Khabarovsk expressed confusion about the purpose of [[Mobilization process in Russia | mobilization]] and the country's lack of readiness, citing personal experience of pensioners equipping their son for war while TV broadcasted preparations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The speaker urged viewers to answer three questions to understand the situation:
*   Who crossed the state border on February 24? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   On whose land are military operations taking place? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>
*   Where did taxes go that were supposed to provide the armed forces with first-class weapons and equipment? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>

He noted that if people answer these questions honestly, without bias or influence from state television, the situation will become clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Continuation of Mobilization
A popular Telegram channel, "Base," posted a video of a hotline conversation confirming that [[Mobilization process in Russia | mobilization]] has not been stopped, only conscription *within* the framework of [[Mobilization process in Russia | mobilization]] has been paused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

### [[Second wave of mobilization in Russia | Second Wave of Mobilization]]
Concerns were raised about a potential [[Second wave of mobilization in Russia | second wave of mobilization]] involving up to two million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. To achieve such numbers, the criteria for conscription would need to be softened, likely extending to those without combat experience or prior military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. The age limit is not expected to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

Regarding equipment, the speaker stated that people will have to buy their own uniforms, bulletproof vests, and other gear, as was done in the first stage, often by taking loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. If Kalashnikovs are insufficient, North Korea is expected to provide aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

## Martial Law and Total Control
The [[Second wave of mobilization in Russia | second stage of mobilization]] may be linked to the extension of martial law to large Russian cities, or potentially the entire territory of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. There is "frightening information" about plans to implement "almost complete control over the population" via QR codes by January/February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This system would differentiate citizens into three groups:
*   **Group 1 (70-80% of the population)**: Prohibited from leaving their subject of the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Group 2**: Expanded travel ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Group 3 (smallest, "most trusted people," including security forces)**: Allowed to move throughout the Russian Federation but not to leave the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

It is assumed that leaving the country would require a special permit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Additional restrictions could include a curfew and internment, allowing detention for 30 days without trial or investigation, with a special detention center near Moscow (Sakharov) designated for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

The speaker expressed serious doubts that these "far-reaching plans" could be realized due to "Aryan organization and American businesslike efficiency inherent in Russians," predicting chaos, disorder, and total disorganization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. These concerns may influence the Russian leadership's decision-making regarding martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Card blocking is also anticipated for those in the [[Mobilization process in Russia | mobilized]] database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

## [[Public perception and potential triggers for sociopolitical change in Russia | Political Crisis]] and Societal Response
There is a probability that "Turbopatriots" will gain influence in a [[Russian political climate | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The elite's response will depend on their determination and resources, potentially seeking support from society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. The choice for citizens will be between "bad, very bad, and absolutely unacceptable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

### Russia's Disintegration
The speaker believes Russia will not disintegrate unless the ongoing political, socioeconomic, financial, and banking crisis becomes "protracted" for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

## Putin's Understanding of History
While Putin publicly discusses historical topics, and his ex-wife noted his knowledge of history, the speaker asserts that Putin "knows it very poorly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. His relationship with history is characterized by "biased confirmation," selecting only what aligns with his views formed by "one-sided" Soviet textbooks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. For example, Putin is convinced that Russians and Ukrainians are "one people," which is "completely untrue" from a historical and cultural perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>. He was also deeply interested in the period before World War II and the Great Patriotic War, but the lessons he drew from it seem to have been "harmful and counterproductive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

## Military Expansion into Transcaucasia
Military-political plans for expansion into Transcaucasian countries like Georgia and Armenia have existed for a long time, as the General Staff typically develops plans for conflicts with all neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. However, implementation is considered "practically no chance" given the Russian armed forces' involvement in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Additionally, the military elite and General Staff leadership are reportedly against such plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

## Cult of Personality and Truth
The speaker predicts that the personality cult of the current leader will "undoubtedly" be dispelled, beginning during his lifetime as he weakens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Propagandists who currently praise him will change their tune, revealing many "exploits" that represent only a "tiny Tolik" of the full truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>.

## Law Enforcement Checks and YouTube
It is unlikely that law enforcement will conduct apartment-to-apartment checks of Muscovites' YouTube subscriptions due to a lack of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. However, the possibility of YouTube being completely blocked exists, despite the authorities also using the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. For those traveling abroad, it is advised to ensure phones do not contain "questionable materials" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.

## Russian Societal Psychology
Russian society's "manic persistence" in demonstrating a "perverted form of Stockholm syndrome" towards the state and an "imperial sin of the beggars" is attributed to psychological compensation for a "terrible present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. People rationalize their difficult reality by flattering themselves with ideas of national greatness, often reinforced by state propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. When confronted with facts, individuals tend to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

## Revolutionary Movement in Russia
Contrary to the belief that a revolutionary movement in Russia would have a "small whiskey" (leftist) character, the speaker believes it is "not at all necessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. He suggests that radical elements, possibly radical populists like Yevgeny Prigozhin, may have a higher chance of success, noting that leftists currently show no ability to mobilize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Left-populist rhetoric can also be successfully used by right-wing politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>.

## Fate of Crimean and Donbas Residents
If Ukraine reoccupies Crimea and Donbas, pro-Russian residents, especially those considered collaborators, could face persecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>. Collaboration could include actively participating in Russian authorities' actions or distributing humanitarian aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>. A "filtering" of the entire population in these regions is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. These are "inevitably built-in risk[s]" in a high-intensity armed confrontation, especially for Ukraine, which views it as a struggle for national independence, leading to a "radical and brutal character" in the post-war period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>.

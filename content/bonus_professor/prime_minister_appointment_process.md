The appointment of the Russian Prime Minister, Mikhail Mishustin, was not predetermined, but rather the result of an intense and sharp struggle within the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. This process highlighted significant [[russian_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | political dynamics amidst leadership changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

## Competing Coalitions and Candidates

The formation of the new government led to a sharp increase in turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The political landscape was dominated by two main opposing coalitions: the Chemezov coalition and the [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Patrushev]] coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. The conflict between these groups, along with other elite factions, shaped Russian domestic politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Initial Plan and Resistance
From late November to mid-February, an agreement indicated that [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Dmitry Patrushev]] would become Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This plan also involved a radical renewal of the government by 75-80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> and positioned [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Dmitry Patrushev]] as the heir to the "so-called President Putin," who is believed to be a double (Yevgeny Vasilyevich, a carpenter from Mogilev, Republic of Belarus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This potential [[use_of_body_doubles_in_political_leadership | use of body doubles in political leadership]] is highlighted in the narrative.

However, by mid-February, the [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Patrushev]] coalition's plans faced strong and seemingly insurmountable resistance from the Chemezov coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The Chemezov coalition categorically opposed [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Dmitry Patrushev]] becoming Prime Minister and subsequently President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

This led to a stalemate, with [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Nikolai Patrushev]] backing [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Dmitry Patrushev]], and the Chemezov coalition supporting Denis Manturov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Each group blocked the other's preferred candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Compromise Options
Several compromise candidates were considered:
*   **Anton Vaina:** Head of the Presidential Administration, who refused the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **A security official:** Described as a second compromise candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **Alexey Dyumin:** Appeared in the last days before the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. He was considered a compromise figure for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

## China's Influence and Mishustin's Appointment

A significant factor in the appointment process was China's advocacy for Mikhail Mishustin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Chinese officials insisted on Mishustin becoming Prime Minister because he personally appealed to Xi Jinping, promising to fulfill all obligations towards China assumed by the "late President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

China's condition for agreeing to a visit by the "so-called president" (the double of the late President Putin) to Beijing in mid-May was Mishustin's appointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This dependence on China, militarily and economically, causes strong irritation among the Russian elite, who feel humiliated by external dictation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

## The "Rotten Compromise"

The parties eventually agreed to accept Mishustin's candidacy, a decision the speaker refers to as a "rotten compromise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This compromise involved several key points:

*   **Vice-Premiers:** Denis Manturov (from the Chemezov coalition) and [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Dmitry Patrushev]] (from the [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Nikolai Patrushev]] coalition) were both appointed as Vice-Premiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Denis Manturov became the first Vice-Premier, while [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Dmitry Patrushev]] was simply a Vice-Premier, indicating a slightly improved position for Chemezov's coalition in the socio-economic part of the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Future Prime Minister:** [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Nikolai Patrushev]] was promised that a new Prime Minister would be appointed by the end of the year, and this person would be [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Dmitry Patrushev]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **[[putins_political_challenges_and_potential_leadership_changes | Presidential Succession]]:** The timeline for [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Dmitry Patrushev]]'s transformation into president, potentially following an early resignation of the "so-called President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, was conditionally postponed from fall 2024 to winter/spring (early 2025) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

## [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Nikolai Patrushev]]'s Role and Influence

As part of this deal, [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Nikolai Patrushev]] "went into the shadows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. However, he maintains control over the security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that the person, not the position, holds significance in the Russian political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Therefore, even with Sergei Shoigu becoming the Secretary of the Security Council, the first deputy, Nurgaliev (who remained), will manage affairs under [[role_of_nikolai_patrushev_in_russian_leadership | Patrushev]]'s continued control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

### Shoigu's Demotion and Belousov's Appointment
The expectation of Shoigu's removal as Minister of Defense was high, though not a foregone conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. A purge of his deputies was anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. The speaker did not know who Shoigu's successor would be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

## Ongoing Turbulence and Future Prospects

This compromise is not considered long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>. The speaker anticipates a sharp intensification of turbulence in Russian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>, with the ongoing conflict between the two coalitions inevitably leading to direct confrontation and bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. The prediction is that "mercenaries will exit power" within 6-8 months as a result of this compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. The "real weight of political world of certain individuals" holds more sway than the official hierarchy of institutions in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.

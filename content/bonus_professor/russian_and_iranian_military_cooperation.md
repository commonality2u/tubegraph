## Alleged Arms Transfers
According to the head of the Israeli Mossad, Russia anticipates receiving new weapons systems from Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Primarily, these systems are said to include ballistic missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

A public statement from the head of Mossad indicated that a first batch of ballistic missiles is expected to be transferred from Iran to the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

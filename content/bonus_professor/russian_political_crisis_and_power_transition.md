From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The current [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | Russian political dynamics and power struggles]] are characterized by a [[political_transition in Russia | political transition]] marked by internal power struggles, questions about leadership, and a looming [[russian_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | political crisis]].

## Putin's Health and Use of Doubles

The speaker asserts that there was no meeting between Putin and Prigozhin or Wagner commanders on June 29, 2023, despite statements from Putin's press secretary Peskov, and that such a meeting was never planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The Kremlin reportedly intends to use fake photo and video documents depicting a staging with a Putin double and Wagner commanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The use of doubles for the current president has been ongoing, with their appearance tracing back to at least the second decade of the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Their use intensified after the Crimean annexation in 2014, and even more so from 2020, when the need arose for doubles to replace the current president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:09:03]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that the widespread use of doubles is known to the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. The fact that the president no longer appears in public consistently contributes to the delegitimization of power in the eyes of the elite and, subsequently, in the eyes of Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

### The Future of Doubles

While it is possible that doubles may temporarily replace Putin for a short period, they are not expected to rule Russia long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Recruited with promises of plastic surgery to restore their original appearance and substantial financial compensation, there are serious doubts whether these promises will be fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Current Political Landscape

With the president perceived as weak, operational management of the country falls to the highest officials, who make decisions within their competence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently seen as performing a decorative or propaganda function, rather than its full duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Key Figures and Their Roles

*   **Sergei Ivanov**: Has no important role in the ruling elite and no influence on Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Prosecutor General Krasnov**: His speech at a Security Council meeting before the "special military operation" was cut from public broadcast because it was considered too "hawk-like" even by Kremlin standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Prime Minister Mishustin**: Putin views Mishustin as a "good, obedient, loyal technocrat" and does not consider him a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Mishustin lacks political ambitions and resources to realize any, and would be declared incompetent to become President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Patrushev's Group**: The elite around Patrushev have not seized power despite the perceived incapacitation of the current leader, primarily due to mutual fear and paralysis, though Prigozhin's actions have "expanded the framework" of possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Decisive movements are expected by the end of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.
*   **Kadyrov's Army**: The speaker believes that canceling funding for Kadyrov's group would not lead to a scenario like Prigozhin's, stating there are "own solutions for this case" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.
*   **Oligarchs**: Figures like Rotenberg, Kovalchuk, and Gennady Timchenko are currently in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.
*   **Medvedchuk and Yanukovych**: They are considered "political corpses" with no role in the political process, despite money being allocated for Medvedchuk's potential use in "new territories" of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.

### Public Sentiment and Engagement

The speaker notes that a majority of people in Russia are "designed" to learn only through "cruel mistakes, deprivation, losses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Despite this, there are forces within Russia who prioritize the country's future, including its intellectual potential, science, industry, education, and medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Such individuals exist even within the [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | Russian government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Post-Transition Russia

The speaker and his group intend to come to power, stating "not if I, when" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>.

### Government Structure

The speaker believes that Russia cannot immediately transition to a parliamentary republic because a full-fledged parliament with full-fledged parties would take 10-12 years to develop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. The new constitution will establish a "new Russian Republic" with transitional provisions for a presidential republic (with restrictions) for an estimated 10-12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. After this period, a referendum will determine whether it becomes a parliamentary or presidential republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>.

The new government's primary task will be to ensure the "secondary industrialization" of the country, including restarting production where possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Judicial Reform

Russia needs comprehensive judicial reform, which would include:
*   A broad amnesty with rehabilitation for innocent convicts, estimated to be up to a quarter of the prison population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   Total lustration of the judicial corps without exception, implemented gradually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   Changes to the judicial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

### Other Proposed Changes

*   **Flag**: The current national flag could be retained, similar to Germany's post-war decision, or a new flag could be adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.
*   **Lenin's Mummy**: The speaker states that Lenin's mummy in the mausoleum has never played and will never play a mystical role in modern power or politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. It remains unburied for purely political, pragmatic reasons, serving as a potential false target to distract the electorate from unpleasant events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Migrants and Ethnic Criminal Groups**: The problem of migrants and ethnic criminal groups is deemed solvable, currently lacking only "goal-setting" and "political will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Solutions involve controlling migrant numbers based on Russia's economic needs and directing their placement, similar to Finland's approach to Arctic Circle jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:17:10]</a>.

## War with Ukraine and Future Relations

Some forces planning to come to power after Putin are ready to quickly end the armed conflict with Ukraine, while others are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The document Putin showed to African leaders, purporting to be a signed peace treaty with Ukraine from March/April, was a "fake" and a "hoax" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

Regarding future relations, while friendship between Russia and Ukraine is unlikely, pragmatic relations can be built relatively quickly, "absolutely definitely in our lifetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.

### Military Capabilities

If the Ukrainian offensive is defeated, Russian armed forces have the technical capability to go on a counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. The potential of the Russian armed forces and defense industry should not be underestimated, as it is gradually being utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

## [[russian_economic_issues_and_potential_crises | Economic Issues]] and Personal Finance

In anticipation of potential further increases in retirement age and state unreliability, it is advised to save money in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a>. Due to inflation, savings are likely to be reduced, so the goal should be to save rather than increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

Recommendations for future financial stability include:
*   Purchasing foreign currency now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.
*   After the crisis, utilizing currency deposits in a rapidly developing banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   Investing in real estate for passive income through renting, while acknowledging a long payback horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>.

## South Ossetia and Abkhazia

The future of South Ossetia and Abkhazia will be decided after the end of the [[russian_political_dynamics_and_political_crisis | political crisis]] in Russia, through difficult political negotiations with all interested parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. This issue is not expected to be resolved quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The speaker, Valery Solovey, discusses [[european_politics_and_relations_with_russia | European values]] in response to a question about his attitude towards them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. He holds a "very positive attitude" towards traditional, conservative [[european_politics_and_relations_with_russia | European values]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## Defining European Values
These values are associated with:
*   Politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>
*   Freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>
*   Freedom of the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
*   Freedom to do business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>
*   The relationship between society, the individual, and the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>

These principles formed the foundation of the modern West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Solovey describes them as "very positive, life-affirming" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Relevance to Russia
The speaker believes that the application of these [[european_politics_and_relations_with_russia | European values]] in Russia would be "extremely useful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. He notes that some of these values are already shared by Russian society, such as the desire to travel freely and conduct business freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The protection of private property, if legal and protected by law, is also identified as a [[european_politics_and_relations_with_russia | European value]] that resonates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

He clarifies that the issues of "multiple genders" sometimes associated with modern Europe are "foam on genuine [[european_politics_and_relations_with_russia | European values]]" and should not distract from the core principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. He suggests that it is within Russia's power to "separate the wheat from the chaff" and choose its political and ideological direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Historical Relations with the West
The speaker asserts that relations between [[european_politics_and_relations_with_russia | Russia]] and the West were notably positive and mutually beneficial under Putin, before he "screwed it all up completely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. He disputes the narrative that the West sought to threaten Russia, stating there was "no hint" of such intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. While the West might have aimed to "oust Russia's influence," this was done cautiously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.

For instance, he doubts the claim that a NATO fleet would have been in Crimea if Russia had not taken it, stating there were "no signs of this at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. The entry of "beam countries" into NATO did not pose a threat to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.

## Minsk Agreements
Regarding the Minsk agreements, the speaker notes that they were a "fiction from all sides" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.
*   **Ukrainian side and its Western supporters**: Sought to "win time," viewing it as a "Brest Peace" for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.
*   **Russian side**: Aimed to legitimize its broader plan for Ukraine, influence Ukraine through the agreements, integrate Donbas, and change Ukraine's constitution to create a "built-in bomb" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. This goal was to transform Ukraine into a confederate state, critically dependent on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.

Essentially, all parties involved were "not very honest" in their intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

China's approach to Russia's military operations and oil exports reveals a strategic stance that suggests influence and control over its partner.

## Influence on Russia's Military Strategy

China, through its leadership, has reportedly set conditions for engaging with the Russian President. Comrade Xi required the Russian side to provide a plan for completing its "special military operation" as a prerequisite for visiting Moscow or even holding telephone conversations with Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This indicates [[Chinas influence on Russian politics | China's influence]] on [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russia's political and military strategies]].

In response to this demand, Putin conveyed a message expressing confidence in achieving a "final victory" no later than mid-summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. This "victory" is understood to mean the acquisition or control over new territories, followed by an exit into peace negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. The message suggests a truce, ceasefire, or potentially even a peace treaty could be achieved by mid-summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. However, the speaker notes that a peace treaty at that stage "looks extremely dubious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## Stance on Russian Oil Exports

According to a Bloomberg Newsletter report, China's COSCO, which is the world's largest sea transportation operator, has refused to transport oil from Russia since December 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. This refusal began when a price ceiling on [[oil_prices_and_russias_global_relations | oil prices]] and other restrictions on [[Russias oil price and export strategy | Russian oil export]] were introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Specifically, COSCO has ceased transporting oil from the Far Eastern port of Kozmino <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>. A Greek company that is also a sea transportation operator has announced a similar boycott <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.

This action by [[Chinas geopolitical stance and its impact on Russia | Chinese comrades]] is seen as not just demanding reports from Russia, but treating the Russian Federation akin to how "a cook treats potatoes, doing with it practically whatever they would like" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.

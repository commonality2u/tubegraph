This article outlines the legal framework and practical implications concerning [[military service and mobilization strategies | military mobilization]] and [[martial law and its implications | martial law]], drawing from Federal Laws in Russia. The information presented is based on a discussion by Valery Solovyov, Doctor of Historical Sciences and political analyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Foundations of Mobilization and Martial Law

A decision on mass [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]] is inextricably linked with the [[introduction of martial law and restrictions | introduction of martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The order of these events (whether [[introduction of martial law and restrictions | martial law]] precedes or follows [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]]) is not considered fundamental, as they are "inextricably linked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

Key federal laws relevant to [[mobilization and legal grounds | mobilization and its legal grounds]] include:
*   Federal Law 31: The Law on [[military service and mobilization strategies | Mobilization Preparation and Mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   The Federal Constitutional Law on [[martial law and its implications | Martial Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   The Law on [[military service and mobilization strategies | Military Duty and Military Service]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Defining Mobilization
[[military service and mobilization strategies | Mobilization]] is understood as the transfer of the country's state structures, economy, and everyday life to a war footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Decisions on [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]] can only be made by the President, based on existing federal laws and potentially new legal acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

[[military service and mobilization strategies | Mobilization]] can be either partial (affecting specific territories) or full (nationwide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. There is a high probability that even a partial [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]] could evolve into a full national [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Grounds for Martial Law
Reasons for the [[introduction of martial law and restrictions | introduction of martial law]], which is associated with [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]], are listed in the Law on [[martial law and its implications | Martial Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. These include:
*   Bombing of the territory of the Russian Federation by foreign armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   An attack by the armed forces of a foreign state on the armed forces of the Russian Federation, regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Exile of armed gangs, groups, regular forces, and mercenaries by a foreign state to carry out aggression against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

It is noted that formally, [[legal and financial considerations under martial law | legal grounds]] for the [[introduction of martial law and restrictions | introduction of martial law]] and subsequent [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]] already exist based on these points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Who is Subject to Mobilization?

Citizens in the reserve who do not have a formal deferment are subject to conscription for [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Men**: All men with a military ID aged 18 to 50 years, who have a fitness category for the army (fully fit (A) or fit with minor restrictions (B)) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Those with category 'V' (limited fit) who do not serve in peacetime due to health problems but receive a military ID after 27 years can also be mobilized from 27 to 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Women**: Women who have the necessary education and [[military service and mobilization strategies | military registration]] specialty are also subject to conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This primarily includes medical professionals, but not exclusively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

Those in the reserve are distributed among three categories for privates:
*   First category: Men under 35 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   Second category: Up to 45 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   Third category: Up to 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
Mobilization calls will primarily start with the first category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Who is Not Subject to Mobilization / Deferments
The following categories are generally not subject to [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]] or can receive a deferment:
*   Those who have not served and have not received a military ID up to 27 years old, as they are not considered to be in the reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Students studying full-time in scientific educational institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. However, new legal acts could change this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   Persons liable for [[military service and mobilization strategies | military service]] reserved for civilian needs (Category G) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   Those temporarily not fit for [[military service and mobilization strategies | military service]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   Individuals caring for relatives or disabled people requiring supervision, confirmed by medical certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   Guardians of minor brothers or sisters if there are no other guardians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Parents with four or more dependent children under 16 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   Single parents and pregnant women after 22 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   Senators and deputies of the State Duma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   Citizens with an unexpunged or unexpunged conviction for a serious crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Petty hooliganism, however, would still subject one to [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Those who received a category at the draft board indicating they are generally not fit for [[military service and mobilization strategies | military service]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   Certain categories of citizens may be granted a deferment by the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Procedures and Potential Restrictions

### Appearance at Assembly Points
All citizens subject to conscription are obliged to appear at assembly points within the timeframes specified in [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]] orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Orders can be delivered at home or workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

In the developed organizational and technical plan for [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]], it is assumed that orders may be presented not only by military registration and enlistment office employees but also by police patrols or Russian Guard patrols to deter evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### Travel Restrictions
When [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]] is announced, those registered for [[military service and mobilization strategies | military service]] are prohibited from leaving their place of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. If orders or summonses are received, they are obliged to appear at military commissariats or other relevant authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Valid Reasons for Not Appearing on Summons
According to the Federal Law on [[military service and mobilization strategies | Military Duty, Military Service]], valid reasons for not appearing on summons include:
*   Illness or circumstances leading to a loss of ability to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   A serious health condition or death of certain listed relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Consequences of Evasion

### Peacetime Penalties
In peacetime, failure to appear on a military summons leads to administrative liability, typically a warning or a fine of 500 to 3000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Evasion of [[military service and mobilization strategies | military service]] (under Article 328 of the Criminal Code) in peacetime can result in a fine of up to 200,000 rubles or imprisonment for up to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### Wartime Penalties
Penalties in wartime are not explicitly detailed, but it is implied they would be more severe, especially if [[martial law and its implications | martial law]] is declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## Financial and Travel Considerations Under Mobilization

Beyond physical summons, there are intentions to block bank accounts and cards of those subject to [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]], and restrict travel abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Financial Blockades**: Individuals might prepare by transferring money to relatives' accounts or withdrawing cash in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Travel Ban**: For foreign travel, it is advised to keep a foreign passport in a safe place for quick access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Potential [[issues_related_to_military_mobilization_and_its_impact | Socio-Economic Impact]]
> The speaker warns that mass [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]] implies a transfer of the entire country, including the economy and financial system, to a military footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This could involve confiscation of private assets like cars for logistical needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. The banking system is also expected to be severely impacted, with some internal estimates suggesting a plunge into "financial hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Geographical Impact
> [[military service and mobilization strategies | Mobilization]] is expected to primarily affect residents of small and medium-sized cities, impacting large cities last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Recommendations and Preparedness

The speaker urges individuals to think and make decisions now regarding their strategy if they view [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]] as a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. It is better to "lose a little money than a precious life and no less precious health" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Waiting until [[military service and mobilization strategies | mobilization]] is announced will be too late for planning and decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. This proactive approach is critical as once "time X" comes, action will be required, not thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

The "new configuration of power" in Russia is a central topic of discussion, with its construction being actively prepared for formation in the fall [00:00:41]. This development is not always externally noticeable, though there have been some signs [00:01:10]. The primary goal of this new configuration is to ensure the safety of [[change_of_power_in_russia | transitions]] in the "post-punctual era" and maintain [[future_challenges_in_russia | stability]] [00:01:21].

## Ensuring Stability in a Non-Democratic System

In non-democratic systems like the Russian Federation, where power is concentrated in the executive, specifically presidential power, and legislative and judicial branches are seen as "pathetic appendages," stability is maintained differently [00:02:24]. It is not achieved through the delimitation of branches of power but through the differentiation of influence and mutual deterrence among opposing groups and elite detachments [00:03:00]. This involves strategically placing individuals to control various spheres and creating a risk of mutual destruction or paralysis to prevent any single group from seizing full power [00:03:37, 00:06:40].

A negotiating platform or a moderator/coordinator is also essential for such a system [00:03:48]. This role was previously held by the "late Putin" [00:03:54]. With his absence, a new platform is needed to ensure spheres of influence are divided on new grounds [00:03:57].

## Proposed Structure of the New Configuration

This proposed [[russian_government_restructuring | restructuring]] of power, planned for the fall, involves several key changes and agreements between elite coalitions [00:05:34].

### Prime Minister
It is anticipated that a new person will become Prime Minister in the near future, specifically by autumn [00:04:10]. Denis Manturov, a protégé of Viktor Chemezov, is a discussed candidate [00:04:19]. The Chemezov coalition is considered highly influential, possibly more so than the Patrushev coalition [00:04:38].

### Presidential Elections and Candidates
The preconditions for early presidential elections include the resignation of "Putin's double," referred to as Yevgeny Vasilyevich, who is currently seen as "usurping" the position [00:05:06]. The Russian elite reportedly seeks to quickly remove this "doll" from leadership due to perceived risks [00:09:41].

One of the agreements, as of today, is that while one coalition (Chemezov's) places its minister (Prime Minister), another person will run for president [00:05:54]. The Patrushev coalition has proposed Dmitry Patrushev as the presidential candidate [00:06:02]. He is expected to start his campaign from a different position than his current vice-premier role [00:06:16].

There are rumors among informed sources that Dmitry Patrushev's chances may be low, but his candidacy remains the most obvious assumption [00:07:52]. Should he become president in early elections, the system is designed with [[change_in_the_political_landscape_in_russia | checks and balances]] [00:08:42]. Nikolai Patrushev, his father, has promised to step down from any government position if his son is elected, remaining in an informal or insignificant capacity [00:08:53].

If Dmitry Patrushev does not run or is unsuccessful, Nikolai Patrushev is expected to head the State Council [00:10:07].

### The State Council: The New Politburo
The State Council is designated to become the central negotiating platform where the key Russian elite will be united [00:06:58, 00:07:07]. While the Security Council previously functioned as the Politburo, in the new configuration, the State Council will assume this role [00:07:31].

Alexei Dyumin's appointment as Secretary of the State Council is seen as a symptom of this new configuration's formation [00:10:33]. His influence will depend on the overall significance of the State Council [00:10:53]. Dyumin reportedly has good relations with both the Chemezov and Patrushev factions [00:11:11].

If Dmitry Patrushev becomes president, the State Council will be headed by Chemezov, creating a system where the president (backed by Patrushev) and the head of the State Council (Chemezov) provide mutual restraint [00:08:39, 00:09:12].

## Broader Implications and Context

### Strikes on Russia
The possibility of massive Western strikes on Russian territory, including military and critical infrastructure, is directly linked to the perceived absence of the "real" Putin [00:11:48, 00:13:54]. Western powers understood that the "living Putin" (the double) is not the same as the "crazy and dangerously crazy" original Putin, who was feared for his willingness to escalate [00:12:53]. The current ruling group is seen as more realistic, not wanting to engage in thermonuclear war, and having internal limitations [00:13:37]. This has led to a decrease in the perceived risks of escalation compared to when the original Putin was alive [00:14:50]. The original Putin reportedly died on October 26 last year at 20:42 Moscow time [00:15:04].

While these strikes will not lead to a strategic turning point in the conflict or a Ukrainian military victory, they are capable of weakening Russia's offensive impulse and causing damage to its armed forces and logistics [00:15:42, 00:15:55]. This could lead to another strategic impasse by September [00:16:17, 00:16:47].

### Peace Talks with Ukraine
The potential for a strategic impasse in the conflict by autumn might incentivize direct peaceful consultations between Russia and Ukraine [00:16:57]. Russia previously made an offer for peace talks, but Ukraine rejected it as unacceptable [00:17:11, 00:17:31]. However, a change in perception on both sides is possible by September, potentially increasing Russia's readiness for a "broad compromise" [00:17:37, 00:17:58]. The [[future_political_changes_and_developments_in_russia | internal political dynamics]] within the Russian Federation, particularly the potential for an unforeseen and destructive [[potential_political_changes_in_russia_after_putin | power transition]], could also influence Ukraine's willingness to engage in peace talks [00:18:14].

### Return of Yevgeny Prigozhin
A bronze monument to Yevgeny Prigozhin has appeared in St. Petersburg at the Porokhovskoy cemetery [00:19:11]. This is interpreted as his "return to Russia in this capacity," with the implication that the actual Prigozhin will eventually return and visit his own monument [00:19:21]. This situation is described as "grotesque" and "macabre humor," reflecting the unpredictable nature of [[future_political_and_social_changes_in_russia | Russian politics]] [00:19:45].

The speaker emphasizes that major events are brewing in Russia, described as the biggest in 25 to 30 years, which will change the trajectory of the country's development [00:22:37, 00:22:45].

Valery Soloviev, a Doctor of Historical Sciences, political analyst, and public figure, discusses the implications of new laws in Russia, particularly the expanded "Law on Foreign Agents," framing the current situation as "clinical madness" with historical parallels to totalitarian regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## An Illustrative Fantasy: Christ in Modern Moscow

To illustrate the repressive nature of current Russian laws, Soloviev fantasizes about Jesus Christ appearing in modern Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. He postulates that Christ would be instantly arrested, not for religious reasons, but for violating two fundamental laws of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>:

*   **Ban on Unauthorized Public Events**: Any public gathering can be deemed unauthorized by court decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Law on "Fakes" Against the Russian Armed Forces**: If Christ were to repeat the Sixth Commandment, "Do not kill," he would be immediately detained and accused of spreading "fakes" against the Russian armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This commandment is effectively "banned" in Russia in a literal sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Soloviev suggests the State Duma might soon demand changes to Holy Scripture itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

> "Christ probably, of course, they wouldn't crucify him now, but they would definitely give him a ten without thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Evolution of the [[reasons_for_being_declared_a_foreign_agent_in_russia | Law on Foreign Agents]]

The law on foreign agents has undergone significant changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>:

*   **Old Version**: Individuals were accused of agent activity if they received any financial assistance from abroad, even a small amount like 200 rubles, with a "100% chance of being declared an agent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **New Version**: A person can be declared a foreign agent if they are "under foreign influence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This broad definition means that potentially "almost every citizen of the Russian Federation can turn out to be a candidate for foreign agent," simply by using a foreign language learned at school or university, or for professional or entertainment purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
*   **New Category**: The proposed bill includes a new category: "family members and agents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. This harks back to the Stalinist formulation of "families of traitors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

This expansion means that "any dissatisfied" person, even someone with an "insufficiently enthusiastic" or "overly critical facial expression," could be targeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>. An example is cited of a person fined in Siberia for their "facial expression" expressing approval of a peace action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>.

## Reasons for "Clinical Madness" and the Search for "Enemies of the People"

Soloviev attributes the intensifying "clinical madness" to the military-political reality, specifically the special military operation in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. The military-political goals of this operation are becoming "increasingly difficult to achieve," and the "dynamics of military actions" and the "moral-political state of the Russian Armed Forces" are on a "downward trend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. The prospect of victory is described as a "ghost" dissolving like a mirage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.

Since the Supreme Commander-in-Chief (the President) cannot be blamed for these failures, a common Russian "anthropological pattern" of blaming others or circumstances leads to identifying "enemies of the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

### Defining "Enemies of the People"

Drawing from President Putin's speech at the Prosecutor General's Office, the "enemies of the people" are those associated with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. Putin stated, "The West's primary task is to split Russian society, destroy the country from within" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>, and that "fakes and calls for illegal actions are often organized from abroad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

Two categories of enemies have been identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>:

1.  **[[reasons_for_being_declared_a_foreign_agent_in_russia | Foreign Agents]]**: These individuals cause "information damage by spreading fakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>.
2.  **Outright Terrorists and Saboteurs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.

### Historical Analogies for "Enemies"

Soloviev identifies two historical eras that inform the current identification of enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>:

*   **Weimar Germany (1920s-early 1930s)**: The idea that Germany lost World War I due to a "knife in its back" by "moral decay and national traitors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>. In modern Russia, [[reasons_for_being_declared_a_foreign_agent_in_russia | foreign agents]] are seen as those trying to "stick a knife in the back" of society and the armed forces through "fakes and the decomposition of the armed forces and society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.
*   **Stalin's Russia**: The notion that opposition leads to "direct terrorist activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:00">[15:19:00]</a>. This logic determined the "infamous Moscow trials of 1936-1938," where defendants confessed to killing Soviet figures and preparing assassinations on foreign intelligence instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>. A direct parallel is drawn to Putin's 2022 report about neutralizing "neo-Nazis" allegedly preparing to murder TV presenter Vladimir Solovyov on Ukrainian security service instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook

Soloviev predicts that this logic will lead to the "organization of public trials" for foreign agents who have supposedly transitioned to "terrorist activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>. He anticipates a "Stakhanovite tempo" in counting "fakes" and "exposed and prevented" enemies, reaching "tens of millions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a>.

He warns that Russia is a country where "one historical tragedy repeats itself as a second tragedy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>, and that the current situation is "only at the beginning of this process," with the "peak of exposing national traitors" still ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>.

Despite the bleak outlook, Soloviev offers a ray of hope, asserting that this difficult period "will not last long" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>. He encourages those in Russia to take care of themselves, help each other, and support those who "raise their voices in defense of human dignity, common sense and ordinary... moral values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:42:00">[19:42:00]</a>. He concludes with an affirmation of eventual victory: "No matter how hard it is now, victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>.

This article discusses the [[russian_political_climate_and_leadership | Russian political climate]] and the risks faced by the opposition, particularly in light of the reported death of Alexei Navalny.

## The Death of Alexei Navalny

On Friday, February 16, after 7:00 PM, news emerged that Alexei Navalny had died or been killed [00:00:30]. He was included in the list of terrorists and extremists [00:01:06]. Navalny possessed an "amazing quality" â€“ a commitment to the goals and objectives he set, which was a "great achievement and a distinctive quality" of his as a politician [00:01:25]. He also had "colossal political potential" [00:09:09].

The speaker expresses condolences to Navalny's relatives, family, friends, and all who worked with him, collaborated with him, sympathized with him, supported him, and followed him [00:01:00].

### Suspicions of Political Murder

The speaker is inclined to believe that Navalny's death was a "political murder" rather than a natural one [00:01:48]. An international etiological investigation would be needed to convince him otherwise [00:01:56].

Even if the death were natural, the Kremlin had been creating "impossible conditions" for years to "freeze Alexei" [00:02:08]. His years of imprisonment and time in a punishment cell were intended to critically impact his health and psyche [00:02:22].

Indirect signs supporting the political murder theory include:
*   A very quick, unanimous reaction from the Russian official media, which reported the news "on command" [00:03:07].
*   An unusually quick reaction from Peskov [00:03:22].
*   At least two or three assassination attempts on other "dangerous and important opponents" of the elite group claiming full power in Russia within the last month [00:03:32]. These attempts were "unsuccessful for the regime" but "successful for these worthy people" [00:07:18].

The speaker asserts that the death was "profitable, logical, and consistent" for the Kremlin [00:06:00]. The same people who conceived and led the poisoning operation against Navalny are believed to have now "completed this operation" [00:06:13]. This act aims to remove any risks or threats on the eve of the "so-called presidential elections" and, more importantly, on the eve of the transfer of power to the elite group vying for full power in the Russian Federation [00:06:31]. The goal is to "get rid of the slightest risks now, squeeze out all the grass, cement all the fields where this grass may appear" [00:06:52].

### Anticipated Official Narratives and Propaganda

The speaker anticipates "a lot of cynical lies and real nonsense, a real phantasmagoria" about the circumstances of Navalny's death [00:04:02]. Expected narratives include:
*   Navalny is "actually alive and well and is abroad" [00:04:18].
*   The West sacrificed him to "compromise the so-called presidential elections" or to "blur the effect of the so-called interview of the so-called President Putin with the American journalist Carlson" [00:04:20].

This tactic is described as "blurring" in PR jargon, meaning "throwing in the most notorious phantasmagoria in order to distract people's attention from the essence of what is happening" [00:04:55].

The argument that Navalny's death was "categorically unprofitable for the Kremlin" is dismissed as a fallacy, similar to arguments made after the murder of Nemtsov, the poisoning of Navalny, and before the start of the Russian military operation against Ukraine [00:05:15].

### Call for Independent Investigation

To refute "all the slander, real or apparent, against the Kremlin," the speaker states that the authorities should:
*   Invite international and Western experts, particularly German ones, to conduct an "international public examination" [00:08:01].
*   Give Navalny's body to his family, relatives, and friends for disposal, rather than the Federal Penitentiary Service [00:08:26]. If the government does this, it might check "natural suspicions" [00:08:39].

## Implications for Russian Opposition

The speaker warns that [[opposition_dynamics_in_russian_political_landscape | Russian oppositionists are under threat]], both those who remained in Russia and the "most prominent" who are outside the Russian Federation [00:10:04]. This situation is a "serious warning" [00:10:16].

### Lessons and Outlook

A crucial lesson is to "love those who are alive, who are free, or may not be free in prison" [00:09:47]. The speaker laments that "only the dead they only know how to love the dead but not the living," recalling the "slander" poured on Navalny when he was alive [00:09:31].

The speaker predicts that the year 2024 will not just be dramatic, but "most likely will turn out to be tragic" [00:10:51]. It is expected to be "much harder" than the year the pandemic began or the year the special military operation began, potentially "the hardest year in our entire life" [00:10:59].

Despite the grim outlook, the speaker conveys a "crumb of confidence" and hope, believing that "everything will change for the better and will begin to change already in this 2024" [00:12:08]. The speaker is certain that "victory will be ours for the sake of Alexei, for the sake of all of us" [00:12:27].

### Advice for Survival

In light of the difficult times, individuals are advised to:
*   Take care of their health [00:11:30].
*   Help family and friends, as they are "the key to our stability and the key and conditions for our survival" [00:11:33].
*   "Love each other while we have the strength, while we have such an opportunity" [00:11:52].

The political landscape in Russia is undergoing significant shifts, with an increasing focus on [[change_in_the_political_landscape_in_russia | internal political dynamics]] and [[russian_political_leadership_transitions_and_internal_power_dynamics | potential leadership changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Imminent Political Decisions
The Kremlin is reportedly aiming to conclude the "special military operation" by late autumn or early winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This timeline is influenced by [[internal_russian_political_dynamics_and_changes | internal political dynamics]] and the health of President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. A decision regarding the [[russian_political_leadership_transitions_and_internal_power_dynamics | transfer of power]] or the [[political_dynamics_and_potential_leadership_change_in_russia | transit of power]] to another configuration may begin as early as late autumn or early winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The [[russian_internal_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | internal political agenda]] is set to take precedence for the Kremlin, making an extended military agenda undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

## Emerging Elite Divisions
Previously speculative discussions about tensions and splits within the Russian elites are now becoming a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. An "anti-Chekist" or more accurately, an "anti-Patrushev" coalition, has begun to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

### Key Figures in the Anti-Patrushev Coalition
Prominent individuals reportedly forming this coalition include:
*   Roman Abramovich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>
*   Anatoly Chubais <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
*   Vladimir Potanin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>
*   Oleg Deripaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>
    *   Deripaska notably refrained from applauding Putin upon his entry at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, instead focusing on a folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The "Yeltsin family" is also associated with Deripaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

This coalition is termed "anti-Patrushev" because Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council, is reportedly promoting his son, Dmitry Patrushev (Minister of Agriculture), as a potential successor to President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This proposal is facing significant resistance from various groups, including oligarchs, civilians, and even some within the power structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This marks the beginning of a powerful elite coalition against power remaining in the hands of a security group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

### Alternative Succession Candidates
The anti-Patrushev group reportedly views Finance Minister Siluanov and Central Bank head Nabiullina as [[potential_political_changes_and_future_leadership_in_russia | future leaders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. A potential configuration includes Siluanov as president and Nabiullina as head of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This indicates a clear confrontation between "civilians" and "security forces" within the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

## The Struggle for Putin's Russia
The struggle for [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_consolidation | Putin's Russia]] has already commenced in recent weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. This is driven by the elite's understanding that President Putin will soon have to leave or significantly weaken his presence in Russian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

## Signs of Instability and "Hunting Season"
The union of these anti-Patrushev figures is currently situational, with uncertain future developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. However, it signals the opening of a "hunting season," including for those who may pose a threat or whose departure could send a signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

### Suspicious Deaths
Attention is drawn to the "strange death" of Alexey Agafonov, former head of a Urals energy company, which some well-informed sources suggest may not have been natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. Similarly, there have been strange deaths among oil workers in recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>.

## Public Engagement and Future Outlook
Citizens are encouraged to observe these processes not merely as spectators but as "interested observers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, and later as participants, preparing for a "window or crack of opportunity" that the elite conflict may open for active societal involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>. The upcoming months in Russia are expected to be difficult, unpleasant, and painful for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.

Valery Solovey has addressed numerous questions regarding the alleged use of a double for Russian President Vladimir Putin, particularly in the context of a "transit scheme" and the future of Russian leadership.

## The Double's Role in a "Transit Scheme"
A "preliminary agreement" reached at the turn of November-December, specifically at the very end of November, involves a theoretical transit scheme for power [00:01:47]. This scheme brings into question the role of a double for the president.

It is asserted that a double is intended to participate in organizing presidential elections, which is considered a "big risk" [00:02:05]. However, the current supreme ruler of Russia is identified as [[nikolai_patrushev | Nikolai Patrushev]], a result of a "broad compromise and agreement of a broad coalition" [00:02:19]. This arrangement is temporary, and the elite groups comprising the coalition are observing how Patrushev and his son, Dmitry, would conduct business if the latter becomes prime minister [00:02:36].

## Control Over the Double
If a double is elected president, they would be under "complete absolute control" and "not be allowed to even squeak" [00:05:00]. While the double's freedom might "increase somewhat" and they might "try to play an independent game," this is "unlikely to succeed" due to the constant oversight from the "entire entourage of the so-called president" [00:05:07].

Regarding international meetings, it is noted that during "all the recent international meetings where the deuce participated," no important documents were signed [00:25:58]. This avoids questions of legal force if a double were to sign documents while known as such [00:25:54].

## "Evidence" of the Double
Valery Solovey claims there is "a lot of evidence and proof" that the current president is not the original, stating, "this is not a president at all" [00:05:42]. He argues that public demands for "reinforced concrete, one hundred percent evidence" are unrealistic, comparing it to the lack of public display of deceased Soviet leaders' bodies [00:05:56].

The speaker also states that he had warned that [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death | Putin's death]] would "not be a liberation" but would lead to a worse situation, describing it as "a chance" [00:06:49]. Within "three months" of these statements, facts and evidence would emerge confirming that the "president of Russia is not alive and is being replaced by a double" [00:07:38].

Specific changes cited as evidence include:
*   **Behavior**: A sudden, diametrically opposite change in behavior [00:07:55].
*   **Appearance**: The individual became "younger, became lively cheerful," stopped shaking hands, began hugging and kissing, and became taller [00:08:00]. The double is described as "younger than the president of the deceased president and taller" [00:08:11].
*   **Voice**: A change in voice [00:08:16].

These allegations and data, according to Solovey, have been "published in all major Western and non-Western countries including very respectable publications" [00:08:32].

The existence of such a similar double is explained by extensive "preparation" and "training" over a long period, aided by a "special earpiece, the so-called spy VK" to "avoid big mistakes" [00:29:31]. Despite this, the double "makes many small mistakes" [00:29:44].

## Public and International Perception
Solovey observes that the public's demand for "proof" serves as "justification for one's own inaction" [00:09:10]. He challenges those who doubt the claims about [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death | Putin's death]] to participate in a public lie detector test, provided they cover the costs of the studio, live broadcast, and polygraph operators [00:13:52].

Internationally, leaders from Arab countries and China's Xi Jinping have met with the double, which is attributed to their pursuit of "their own interests" and potential "goodies" [00:17:55]. These countries are "quite happy with what they are seeing now," finding the situation "acceptable" [00:18:13]. The fundamental interest of the West is identified as maintaining "stability" in Russia, regardless of the regime's nature [00:17:11].

Regarding the body of the original Putin, it is said to be in a "Valdai refrigerator" until it can be transferred to "better storage conditions," and it can remain there for "a very long time" [00:29:13]. The double is expected to congratulate the public on the New Year unless something extraordinary happens [00:32:11].

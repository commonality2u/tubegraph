Current analysis suggests that [[social_and_political_changes_in_russia | social and political changes]] in Russia are expected to lead to periods of confusion and chaos, particularly during any attempts to transition or transfer power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Evolution of Protests and Public Response

The Foundation for Combating Corruption (FBK) announced a shift away from active and mass public events, though not a complete abandonment of protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

A proposed "flashlight" action on February 14th (Valentine's Day) was initially met with skepticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. However, the Russian government's strong negative reaction, including comparing participants to "collaborators" and "traitors," was seen as a classic mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. This official condemnation inadvertently contributed to wider dissemination of information about the action and motivated more people to participate, if only to spite the authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Protest Strategy and Potential
Ideally, [[protests_in_russia_and_organizational_challenges | civil activity]] should escalate from safer, easier-to-implement forms to more dangerous ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. However, recent events saw a reversal of this, with dangerous mass protests occurring from January 23rd to February 2nd, followed by a transition to a theoretically safer form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Despite this shift, the potential for [[social_unrest_and_public_dissatisfaction_in_russia | protest]] has not decreased and could have continued for at least two more weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The authorities have perceived this lull as a success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

### Government's Counter-Protest Measures
The government aims to completely disavow any protest activity by approximately the beginning of May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. This struggle involves:
*   **Repressive Policy**: Administrative and police measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
*   **Information Warfare**: Discrediting figures like Navalny, proposing alternative agendas, and engaging in disinformation campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Bribing Opinion Leaders**: Allocation of large sums to bribe opinion leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Anti-Corruption Cases**: Plans to initiate 2-3 high-profile anti-corruption cases to demonstrate the government's effectiveness in fighting corruption compared to Alexei Navalny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## Personal Preparedness for Upcoming Events
For those considering participation in upcoming events, it is advised to prepare by having a supply of cash (not in bank accounts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. More importantly, establishing [[social_and_political_changes_in_russia | regional connections]] within one's community and coordinating with neighbors on how to assist each other in critical situations is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

## Dynamics of Protest Development
The development of [[protests_in_russia_and_organizational_challenges | protest]] typically follows a simple pattern: peaceful protests followed by brutal suppression, leading to the beginning of resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>. A core of 50-200 people is sufficient to initiate resistance within a large crowd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>. This does not necessarily make the protest non-peaceful; it becomes peaceful while resorting to self-defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.

While some people currently express satisfaction with the situation, many are simply afraid to voice their true opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:27">[00:45:27]</a>. For changes to occur in Russia, it is not necessary for the majority to desire them; a determined minority is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. This minority is already actively taking to the streets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>. A small numerical group of people, which is a colossal shift for Russia, could trigger a split within the elites if they receive support from another 2-3% of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>. The demand for changes in the country is colossal, arguably higher than during the late Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>. Many are ready to sacrifice for these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

## Mood of People in Uniform
The mood among the military (army and navy) is generally not very happy, but this does not imply readiness to defy the supreme commander-in-chief or join the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:53">[01:08:53]</a>. The army is expected to remain in its locations, guarding administrative buildings in case of mass riots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>.

In contrast, police in major cities are not enthusiastic about confronting protesters, and there are instances of "quiet sabotage," where officers stop following orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:04">[01:10:04]</a>. It is believed that the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) would fall apart much faster than Ukraine's MVD in a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:39">[01:10:39]</a>. While the commander of the Russian Guard is loyal, not all its members are willing to follow orders to the extent of harming citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Outlook on Future Crisis
Russia is expected to undergo a severe national crisis, though not necessarily a civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>. This is seen as an inevitable path to the future, for which the current government is largely responsible due to its actions over the past 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a>.

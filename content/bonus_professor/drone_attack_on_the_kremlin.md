The situation in Russia is moving quickly towards the introduction of full or partial martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This urgent shift is primarily driven by recent events, most notably the drone attack on the Moscow Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Kremlin Drone Attack

On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, May 3, the Moscow Kremlin was attacked by drones of unknown origin, which are believed to be Ukrainian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The Kremlin's quick public recognition of this fact, through its press secretary and state propaganda machine, is seen as an admission that "things are not going very well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

This attack was not a military or political attempt to target President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It is widely known that President Putin is "practically never in the Kremlin" and prefers to spend his time in deep bunkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Therefore, the Ukrainians did not intend an [[assassination_attempt_on_president_putin | assassination attempt on President Putin]] or to "behead Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

The attack was symbolic in nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. At least one of the two drones was shot down near the Senate building of the Kremlin, where the state flag flies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The goal was to demonstrate that the Kremlin is vulnerable and accessible, and that the Russian flag has fallen, which is considered especially significant in Ukraine on the eve of a Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Preceding Military Actions and Sabotage

The drone attack on the Kremlin followed previous stages that were "truly military in nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>:
*   Sabotage on railway transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   FSB announcements regarding a thwarted assassination attempt on Aksyonov, the head of the Republic of Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   Regular drone attacks on frontline areas and other Russian regions, with increasing frequency and numbers, now reaching the territory of Moscow and the Moscow region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Public Reaction and Hysteria

These events have fostered an "intensive and increasingly tense hysterical atmosphere" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Tension is characteristic of the Russian establishment across all echelons, while hysteria affects "mentally unstable layers of Russian society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

In Moscow and the Moscow region, a "whole mania for searching and detecting Ukrainian drones" has swept the area since April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. On one day, up to 100 calls were received from eyewitnesses claiming to have observed Ukrainian drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. The overwhelming majority of these calls are considered "absolute nonsense," dictated by the fears of the callers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Due to this widespread "mania," Moscow authorities ordered public utilities to monitor the airspace of the Russian capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Additionally, on May 3, the Moscow mayor banned the launching of drones by all except "competent ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. While not "panic," there is strong nervousness and tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Official Response and Martial Law Discussions

Security officers and forces are reacting to the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Security Council Secretary Patrushev demanded that President Putin immediately impose martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Formally, martial law is already in effect in the "so-called new territories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

Putin has postponed the decision on extending martial law to the capital, frontline regions, and possibly other areas until the end of the week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. He is unlikely to make a hasty decision before May 9, when a parade is planned (without the air part) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. It is unlikely Putin himself will be at the parade, but rather his "presidential security service is a deuce" will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Putin understands that introducing martial law would diminish his power in favor of the security officers who would control it, potentially in alliance or confrontation with local authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Amendments to the Federal Constitutional Law on martial law were introduced on May 3 to allow elections in the "new regions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. However, there is uncertainty whether regional elections will be held at all in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Implications of Martial Law

Martial law entails a set of restrictions, primarily on civil rights and freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. For those subject to military service, this could mean:
*   A ban on travel outside the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. There are potentially over 15 million people in the database of those subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   Restrictions on movement between regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   Strengthening of passport control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   Restriction of freedom of speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   The possibility of internment, meaning detention without trial or investigation for up to 30 days, extendable beyond that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   Easier implementation of conscription, with formal restrictions likely to be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Mass checks of those subject to conscription, and escorts to military registration and enlistment offices, are already beginning in some cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

Economically and financially, it is theoretically possible to block bank cards and accounts for those potentially liable for military service or mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Nabiullina has reportedly informed the president that the Central Bank is ready for this, having moved towards it since September of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

The actual implementation of martial law, or its key elements without formal declaration, will depend heavily on the position of local authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. It is expected that the set of measures will vary across different regions and cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Moscow Mayor Sobyanin, for instance, is anticipated to try and maintain the loyalty of Moscow citizens and protect them to the best of his ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

Despite the difficult situation, the speaker maintains that events are moving in a positive direction, which will lead to "liberation, justice, and a different quality life" and the "renewal of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

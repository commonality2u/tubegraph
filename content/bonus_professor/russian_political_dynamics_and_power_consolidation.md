This article summarizes answers to pressing questions about [[russian_political_analysis | Russia's]] internal political climate, power dynamics, and potential changes, as presented in Valery Solovey's program "Answers to Hot Questions," first aired on Thursday, December 7, at 1 PM. The program addresses popular, pressing, and noteworthy questions from viewers [00:00:32].

## [[internal_russian_political_dynamics_and_changes | Political Future and Power Transition]]

A significant [[russian_political_climate | political crisis]] is unfolding in [[russian_political_analysis | Russia]], with major events anticipated in the coming year [00:02:38]. The future hinges on the participation of society's advanced segments in this crisis [00:02:33]. For those unwilling to engage in this struggle or who doubt the country's capacity for change, an exit or migration strategy is advised, especially for younger individuals who can adapt more easily abroad [00:03:19].

The anticipated change in power is described as a "radical change of power" rather than a mere transfer within the existing "Putin regime" [00:02:08]. The timing of the public announcement regarding the "president's" end will be determined by those governing [[russian_political_analysis | Russia]], specifically Patrushev and those associated with him [00:15:21].

Regarding the impact of military outcomes, a defeat generally intensifies political tension and deepens the crisis [00:05:15]. However, resounding victories or crushing defeats for the [[russian_political_analysis | Russian]] side are not expected in December or the next year; the status quo at the front is likely to be maintained [00:05:40].

### Role of the KGB/FSB/Security Forces

The question of how the KGB seized power and contributed to the collapse of the USSR and current destruction of [[russian_political_analysis | Russia]] is deemed based on an incorrect methodology [00:13:52]. It is asserted that the KGB was not in power and suffered greatly from the Soviet Union's collapse, though they did not politically act on this suffering [00:13:59]. Currently, the FSB and other security agencies function as a "political authority" [00:14:25]. Unlike anywhere else globally, [[russian_political_analysis | Russia]] is unique in entrusting intelligence and counterintelligence to govern the country, leading to issues stemming from their inherent "defects of thinking" rather than evil intent [00:14:30].

### The "Putin Double" Theory

Research on the presence of Putin's doubles has been conducted, notably in Britain [00:19:11]. Phonoscopic examinations, which rely on unique voice prints, have concluded with 99% accuracy that the "Putin" who spoke on May 9 and the "Putin" at the World [[russian_political_analysis | Russian]] People's Council in November are different individuals [00:19:47]. The "Putin" at the council was identified as a double named Vasilich [00:20:08]. Recent studies, including one published in *Europe* by a British investigator, also support these findings, with summaries available via a recommended Telegram channel, "Doctor Nightingale" [00:20:14].

The double, Vasilich, is aware of the original's death, having learned quickly due to the immediate and sharp strengthening of his security [00:28:07]. He is believed to enjoy his position as "the first person in the country" [00:28:21]. It is anticipated that the double will participate in elections, with a transit planned for late spring [00:33:10].

### Elite Dynamics and Consequences of Change

[[russian_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Elite groups]] formed during the redistribution of power do exist and are expected to act before the elections, though their exact timing is uncertain [00:33:25]. Their actions will depend on the evolving context of the situation [00:33:43].

The death of the leader will not automatically improve things; it presents a "chance" and an "opportunity" to influence the situation, but the period immediately following will be "hardest times" [00:25:46]. These difficult times are expected to last for months, not years or decades [00:26:00].

### Future of Belarus and Lukashenko

The "president" of Belarus, Lukashenko, is viewed with "bad irritation and disbelief" by Patrushev [00:01:19]. Despite this, Patrushev, focused on consolidating power, does not intend to quarrel with Belarus, one of [[russian_political_analysis | Russia's]] few remaining allies, at this moment [00:01:35]. However, Lukashenko's political and personal fate is tied to events in [[russian_political_analysis | Russia]]; he is not expected to remain at the head of Belarus for long after a radical change of government in [[russian_political_analysis | Russia]] [00:01:53]. It is uncertain if he would have time to flee to Beijing [00:02:18].

## Regional Governance and Justice System

To address issues like business stagflation, corrupt local "kings" in power, and subservient local services, two main levers are proposed for changing the situation in regions [00:09:05]:

1.  **Change in the framework and climate of the state**: This involves a new group of leaders who will adhere to "clearly defined principles" rather than kinship or past merits [00:09:40]. Key steps include simplifying legislation, thoroughly cleaning the judicial system (with complete and exception-less lustration), and cleaning corrupt security agencies [00:10:09]. These reforms are estimated to take about two years [00:10:31].
2.  **Climate change in the regions themselves**: This involves empowering people and fostering confidence in their ability to influence their destiny through the development of local government [00:10:52]. Local authorities should have more powers and, critically, financial support for these powers [00:11:05]. A transition to budgetary federalism is proposed, allowing regions to retain a significant portion of funds generated within their territory [00:11:11]. This encourages more responsible spending and acknowledges local authorities' knowledge of what works [00:11:33].

Regarding accountability, anyone who has committed crimes must face legal consequences, a principled position for the "team" [00:06:13]. Those guilty of crimes against humanity or their own people must be held accountable based on the severity of their offenses [00:06:22].

The idea of "lustration" of election commissions is supported, specifically targeting the "heads of the commission" and "most active accomplices of voting fraud" for court proceedings, not just ordinary members [00:17:31].

## Social and Economic Issues

### Financial Scams and Compensation
Help will be provided to pensioners who suffered from scammers, with assessments of losses [00:07:44]. The process of compensation will be faster than that for Soviet savings, aiming for "quite realistic" terms [00:08:00].

### Food Prices
A "monstrous increase" in prices for chicken, eggs, and meat has been observed, similar to conditions in the 1990s [00:30:15]. Further significant growth in food product prices cannot currently be ruled out [00:30:29].

### Digital Money and Social Rating
The introduction of digital money is considered a good opportunity for financing budgetary organizations, as it allows tracking fund allocation and ensuring transparency in potentially corrupt offices [00:27:30]. However, the speaker is against the use of digital money in settlements between citizens and the state, viewing it as an "excessive means of control" [00:27:50]. Social ratings are viewed negatively, and their implementation is not anticipated [00:27:22].

### Psychology of "Lackeys"
To rid people of a "psychology of lackeys" or the need to behave obsequiously, changes to the legal, political, and economic frameworks are necessary, prioritizing "respect for a person" and "human dignity" [00:23:05]. This would give people the opportunity to change, though it is acknowledged that some may prefer the current way of life [00:23:37]. The goal is to free younger generations from this need [00:23:50].

### Preparing for Crisis
During a potential political crisis, a famine is not expected in [[russian_political_analysis | Russia]] [00:24:00]. However, if the crisis escalates into armed conflict, it will likely be confined to the capital and a few other cities, and be short-lived [00:24:05]. Some supply interruptions are possible, so stocking up on provisions for a week to ten days, along with drinking water, batteries for charging devices, and cash (due to potential internet and online payment disruptions), is advised [00:24:19].

## International Relations

### Henry Kissinger's Influence
Henry Kissinger did not have a significant influence on American politics in the last 10-20 years [00:06:52]. His past laurels from the 1970s and 1980s should not be extrapolated to modern times [00:07:06]. His opinion was recognized, but he was considered a person "who came out in circulation" [00:07:24].

### NATO Perceptions
It is possible to explain to [[russian_political_analysis | Russians]] that NATO poses no threat and is merely a justification for the Kremlin's actions, once the content of propaganda changes [00:14:47]. NATO has never started a war against the Soviet Union or [[russian_political_analysis | Russia]] [00:15:06].

### Kaliningrad Region
The Kaliningrad region is not threatened and will remain part of the [[russian_political_analysis | Russian]] Federation, despite the crisis [00:28:32]. There is no threat of its exit or the collapse of the [[russian_political_analysis | Russian]] Federation [00:28:43].

### Ukraine's Future
Ukraine will remain an "independent sovereign" state [00:33:51].

## Cultural and Social Reforms

### Renaming Streets and Dismantling Monuments
The speaker supports renaming streets and dismantling monuments of leaders, but believes this decision should primarily be left to local communities via referendums, as an element of self-government [00:12:53]. Communities should decide if they want streets named after "serial killers, murderers, mass murderers" [00:13:20].

### Qualified Voters
The idea of creating an institute of "qualified voters" (referencing qualified investors) is discussed, with the suggestion that voters pay for the right to participate in elections [00:16:11]. This, it is argued, would increase voter responsibility and act as a selection mechanism for those truly interested in influencing their future, excluding those who are indifferent [00:16:50].

### LGBT Rights
The ban on LGBT expression is criticized, with the argument that [[russian_political_analysis | Russia's]] real problems are "poverty, lawlessness and impudence of power," not who sleeps with whom [00:29:46]. It is advised that individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, exercise elementary precautions for their safety, as targeted persecution or accusations of "spreading extremist ideology" are possible [00:34:12].

## "Secret Society" and Occultism

The speaker is an "associate member" of a "non-public" society, not a secret one [00:30:35]. This society has no relation to the occult [00:30:46]. While there are no "psychics" or "priest-like" people in the [[russian_political_analysis | Russian]] government now, there were one or two such individuals previously, one of whom is now an active and successful opponent of the current government, possessing "extraordinary" abilities [00:31:26]. The popularity of occultism and magic in the [[russian_political_analysis | Russian]] elite is "very, very high," and Putin himself resorted to various occult and shamanic rituals [00:31:54].

The idea that current events are a "deal between the elites of [[russian_political_analysis | Russia]] and the West to destroy [[russian_political_analysis | Russia]]" is dismissed as an "erroneous point of view" [00:32:07]. What prevents certain actions (unspecified due to noise) is fear for one's own life, as "methods" for "heart attacks" have been long established [00:32:40].

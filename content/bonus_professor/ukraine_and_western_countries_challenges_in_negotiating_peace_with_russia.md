The granting of candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova for European Union membership was a politically and symbolically significant event, indicating the West's readiness to support Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This gesture also signifies Ukraine's shift in its civilizational vector from the "Russian world" towards Europe, a choice influenced by the actions of the Russian Federation and President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Pressure for Peace Negotiations

Despite political and material support for Ukraine, there is increasing behind-the-scenes, and sometimes overt, pressure from assisting countries for Ukraine to agree to conclude a [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace treaty]] with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This pressure stems from internal problems within these Western nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Internal Western Challenges

The main reasons for this pressure are internal issues faced by Western countries, including:
*   **Energy Concerns:** Problems with gas and the euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Germany, for instance, has publicly considered nationalizing part of the Nord Stream pipeline in its coastal waters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Migration Consequences:** The possibility of refugee flows not only from Ukraine but also a potential influx of migrants from North Africa and the Middle East in the event of a global food crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This situation, particularly the artificially directed flow of migrants to Europe, mirrors events from 2015 to 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Domestic Politics:** The current U.S. administration's primary problems are internal, along with upcoming midterm elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

It is highly probable that some Western countries, including the American side, will exert pressure on Ukraine to reach some form of [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | agreement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Resistance to Imposed Peace

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's statement just before the G7 meeting was symptomatic, as he declared himself categorically against forcing Ukraine to [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Such a public warning from a strong supporter of Ukraine suggests intense behind-the-scenes discussions regarding pressuring Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Ukraine's Civilizational Shift

The most important symbolic political event was Ukraine and Moldova being granted candidate status for European Union membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This signifies the West's readiness to symbolically support Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Ukraine and its society have chosen Europe, moving away from the "Russian world," a process accelerated by the actions of the Russian Federation and President Putin himself, who "literally pushed Ukraine out of the potential embrace of the Russian world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This means Ukraine has fundamentally changed its civilizational vector that had been developing over the past several hundred years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

The key issue is not how quickly Ukraine will become an EU member, which is not expected to happen quickly, but rather how quickly and in what amounts the West will provide Ukraine with military and political assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

This article summarizes the military-political week, drawing insights from Dr. Valery Solovey's program on May 15, focusing on the responses of Western countries and Ukraine to the ongoing conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Kremlin's Dilemma and Overtures

The Kremlin has been unable to achieve a turning point in its "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Its chances of achieving a strategic turning point without using "extremely potent means" are decreasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This presents a dilemma: continue actions with little chance of success or attempt to [[ukraine_and_western_countries_challenges_in_negotiating_peace_with_russia | negotiate with Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

To influence Ukraine towards negotiations, the Kremlin believes it must go through the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Russia is sending both overt and covert signals to the West regarding its conditions for negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. These conditions, from the Kremlin's perspective, are now almost minimal compared to its initial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Russia's formulated conditions for a peace treaty include:
*   Complete control of Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   Ukraine's recognition of Crimea as Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   Donbass being independent or potentially part of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   A land corridor to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

An overt attempt at communication involved a conversation between Russian Defense Minister Shoigu and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the first such talk since February 18 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This conversation could only have occurred if there was a direct indication or request from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Western Responses: A Divided Front

The West's response to Russia's overtures has been "rather negative than positive," with differing positions among Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### France and Germany's Stance
France and Germany would not object if Russia and Ukraine agreed to such conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. French President Macron reportedly offered Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to make territorial concessions to Russia to achieve a peace treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Germany, though not as clear in its stance, demonstrates its position by refraining from or delaying the supply of weapons to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

### The "Saxon Bloc" Position
The "Saxon bloc," comprising Great Britain, the United States, Poland, and the Baltic countries, holds a simple and unified position: [[ukraine_russia_conflict_analysis | "war to a victorious end"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This position is also shared by Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Ukraine's Resolute Position

Ukrainian leadership, despite Macron's suggestion, refused to make territorial concessions to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Ukraine feels a growing sense of hope and conviction that it can not only achieve a turning point but also "decisive success" and completely regain all its territories, including those lost before February 24, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This optimism is bolstered by "injections of patriotism" into society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

The Ukrainian Ministry of Defense has declared its readiness to mobilize up to a million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This is part of the preparation for a [[ukraines_potential_offensive_and_its_implications | counteroffensive]] aimed at fully returning Ukraine's territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Western Desire for Peace vs. Escalation
While the "collective West" generally desires a prompt peace treaty and a continuation of the conflict is undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, Russia (the Kremlin and Putin) cannot "leave empty-handed" as this would be seen as admitting defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. The Russian ambassador to Washington even used the term "capitulation" in reference to Moscow's potential defeat in Ukraine, a word previously absent from the lexicon of Russian officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

The West also does not want an escalation of the conflict and has consistently made it clear to Putin that it is not interested in expanding the conflict territorially or taking it to a "qualitatively new level" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Russia's Internal Situation and Propaganda

In the absence of military successes, Russia's Ministry of Defense issues "sensational news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Examples include:
*   An alleged attempt to infect residents of the LPR with tuberculosis through fake bills, which drew historical parallels to Soviet-era rumors about poisoned chewing gum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   Reports on alleged Pentagon experiments in a psychiatric hospital in the Kharkov region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

These news items, which "die a natural death," are not meant to report information but to "occupy the information public space" in the absence of news about successes and victories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

Economically, the Russian president claimed last week that Russia is "successfully overcoming sanctions," which are "to our advantage," and that the ruble is "demonstrating the best dynamics among all currencies in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This optimistic rhetoric is likened to old Soviet jokes about capitalism "rolling into the abyss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

However, behind this optimism, Bloomberg reports a forecasted GDP fall of 12% in Russia, potentially up to 25% under a pessimistic scenario of isolation from world markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This decline would be the largest in 94 years, erasing all economic achievements of the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Car sales in Russia collapsed by almost 80% in April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, and AvtoVAZ is preparing to offer models from the early 90s due to a lack of imported components <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. Mass layoffs have begun in one-fifth of companies, with another third considering it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.

To compensate for the deteriorating social situation and economic prospects, the government is intensifying patriotism, including introducing history lessons from the first grade and restoring the All-Union Pioneer Organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. The speaker suggests that increased talk of patriotism and calls for patience directly correlate with a worsening real state of affairs and declining incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

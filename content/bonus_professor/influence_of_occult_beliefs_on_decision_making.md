The [[occult_practices_in_russian_politics | influence of occult practices]] and [[mystical_beliefs_among_russian_elite | mystical beliefs among the Russian elite]] are topics of significant discussion, with claims suggesting they heavily impact decision-making processes. This influence extends beyond mere superstition, manifesting in actions taken by high-ranking officials based on alleged magical and spiritual considerations.

## Case Study: Shaman Alexander Gabyshev

A notable example of the intertwining of political and [[influence_of_shamanism_in_political_contexts | magical influence]] is the case of Shaman Alexander Gabyshev. His forced psychiatric care and isolation were not solely driven by political repression, but by perceived magical dangers associated with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

After Gabyshev allegedly conducted a ritual to "drive out evil spirits from the Kremlin," a direct order from the Russian President was reportedly given to forcibly drug the shaman to render him a "state of vegetables" or confine him to private life under surveillance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. This occurred just days after his ritual announcement became public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. The seriousness with which the supreme leadership views these matters indicates that occult and magical practices are taken "more than seriously" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>, directly affecting decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.

### The Stolen Soul Rite

Shaman Alexander Gabyshev belongs to a cultural type of shamans whose worldview is based on mythology and folklore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. He is associated with the Siberian-Mongolian cultural group, known for the "rite of the stolen soul" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.

The essence of this ritual involves a demon stealing a person's soul, which the shaman then attempts to retrieve from the lower world with the help of spirits and blessings from the upper world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. The ritual involves a symbolic fight between the shaman and the demon to return the soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.

A critical detail of this ritual is that the person whose soul has been stolen *must* participate; it cannot be performed remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>. Since the president of Russia cannot participate, the ritual is not performed in its authentic form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. Critics argue that Gabyshev's activities, compared to more sinister cults like Voodoo or the practices of [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | world occult orders]], are "naive children's fairy tales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:03:00">[15:03:00]</a>.

### Punitive Psychiatry

The use of psychiatry against Shaman Gabyshev is viewed as punitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>. Natalia Petrovna Bekhtereva, a renowned neurophysiologist, stated that using psychiatry for punitive purposes gives rise to "greater evil with destructive consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:06:00">[16:06:00]</a>. Gabyshev was accused of being dangerous to society and himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>, despite no evidence of him storming populated areas, taking hostages, or threatening violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>. Similarly, there was no indication of self-harm or suicidal tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:29:00">[17:29:00]</a>. From a rational perspective, he is seen as an "ordinary person" with a different worldview, likened to Don Quixote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:00">[17:54:00]</a>.

## Historical Context and Evolution of Occult Interests

The [[influence_of_occult_practices_in_russian_politics | fascination of Russian authorities with occult matters]] is not new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:53:00">[18:53:00]</a>.

### From Rasputin to the KGB

The 20th century saw this interest become more public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>, with Rasputin playing a significant role at the Imperial court, not just as a healer but also in political appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>. However, it's argued that his actual influence was exaggerated, a mythology created to explain the empire's collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>.

The search for a "ring of omnipotence" by Russian rulers, especially Chekists (security officers) since the 1920s, has been a driving force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. Initially, this involved paths through Orthodoxy, but quickly shifted as it failed to provide the desired power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

Soviet security officers actively engaged in [[occult_practices_in_russian_politics | parapsychology]] and psychic studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>, even attempting to solve "time management" and explore time machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:25:00">[27:25:00]</a>. This interest stemmed from a fundamental lack of belief in their own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:39:00">[27:39:00]</a>, leading them to seek external forces to ensure power and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:44:00">[27:44:00]</a>.

### Modern Era: A Deeper Dive into the Occult

Modern [[influence_of_occultism_in_russian_politics | Russian elite's engagement with occultism]] is described as far more extreme than historical precedents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>. This increased interest began around 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>, initially fueled by an interest in predictions. However, after 2014, the focus shifted to actively influencing the future, using a wide range of practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

The psychological motivation for this shift is attributed to the "extreme mental instability" of the current elite, who often feel they occupy their positions for "unknown reasons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:00">[22:21:00]</a>. They seek rationalization for their rise to power, leading them to believe in their "chosenness" by higher powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>. This makes them susceptible to intermediaries and "operators" who claim to offer guidance and solutions to complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:42:00">[23:42:00]</a>.

## Modern Occult Practices

Current practices among the elite are described as "gloomy, more sinister, and frightening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:18:00">[43:18:00]</a>.

### "Flights to Nibiru" and "Flights to Sirius"

These are modern occult practices involving the use of alkaloids found in Russia, such as atropine and psilocybin mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:30:00">[31:30:00]</a>. These "flights" are hallucinatory experiences where participants enter circles or triangles, consume substances, and experience vivid, colorful "communications" with figures like reptiloids or "wine heads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:30:00">[32:30:00]</a>. The objective is to increase serotonin levels, which can lead to schizophrenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:13:00">[33:13:00]</a>. Regular participation leads to addiction and a "rapid personal transformation of degradation" where a "shifted reality" becomes normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:09:00">[35:09:00]</a>. These participants, often high-ranking officials, make political and financial decisions while in this altered state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:22:00">[35:22:00]</a>.

### Voodoo and Santa Muerte Cults in Moscow

Two "relevant and popular" practices in Moscow are Voodoo (specifically the "water" cult, referencing "Palo Mayombe" or similar Bantu traditions) and Santa Muerte (Santa Marta) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:40:00">[46:40:00]</a>. These are described as theatrical, bloody, and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:33:00">[46:33:00]</a>.

#### Voodoo (Water) Rituals
The "toughest, bloodiest" direction of Voodoo involves:
*   Digging up a fresh corpse (preferably a maniac killer or suicide victim) from a cemetery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:00:00">[48:00:00]</a>.
*   Cutting the corpse into pieces, placing them in a barrel with grave soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:14:00">[48:14:00]</a>.
*   Planting live birds on copies of the corpse, which must die in "terrible agony" without throat cuts to illuminate the soil with blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:25:00">[48:25:00]</a>.
*   Carving a wooden doll (40-50 cm) resembling the "victim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:56:00">[48:56:00]</a>.
*   Soaking the doll in a composition of blood (human, not animal) and plant juice for 4 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:30:00">[49:30:00]</a>.
*   Burying the doll in the grave soil with corpse parts for 6 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:47:00">[49:47:00]</a>.
*   Feeding the doll with "the blood of a virgin and the sperm of men" for four days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:00:00">[50:00:00]</a>.
*   Performing a ritual where iron objects are "killed" into the doll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:27:00">[50:27:00]</a>.
*   One doll remains with the adepts, while a second is sent to the intended "victim" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:38:00">[50:38:00]</a>. The psychological impact on the recipient, if they believe in the ritual, is considered key to its effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:47:00">[50:47:00]</a>.

#### Santa Muerte Cult
This cult, originating in Mexico, also involves human remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:05:00">[53:05:00]</a>. It uses a "mummy" (a completely rotted corpse) rather than fresh remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:59:00">[51:59:00]</a>. The corpse is washed, rubbed with incense, adorned with a golden crown and precious jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:16:00">[52:16:00]</a>. Followers consider it necessary to have a human skull, preferably from an "influential person of high rank" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:55:00">[52:55:00]</a>.

## Reasons for Occult Influence

The current [[criticism_and_societal_perceptions_of_occultism_in_russia | high degree of occult involvement]] is partly attributed to the "instability of the modern world," Russia's specific instability, and the uncertainty felt by those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:00:00">[50:00:00]</a>. Psychotherapists working with some elite individuals report an "identical situation" of losing all bearings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:30:00">[43:30:00]</a>.

This interest also stems from a desire to "influence the future" and gain invulnerability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:31:00">[39:31:00]</a>. Some elite members believe they are engaged in an "occult war" against powerful, influential groups, leading them to resort to increasingly potent magical means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:48:00">[39:48:00]</a>.

## Relationship with Traditional Church

The traditional church, specifically the Russian Orthodox Church, faces a complex relationship with these [[occult_rituals_and_psychiatry_in_russia | occult practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:30:00">[54:30:00]</a>. While some clergy avoid, condemn, or deny these practices, others treat them calmly, and "some of them... participate in this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:24:00">[55:24:00]</a>, believing it is the "real path to power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:36:00">[55:36:00]</a>.

The Russian elite is described as seeking a "powerful force" outside of Orthodoxy and Christianity, a trend that has become "more and more noticeable" in the last five to six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:29:00">[56:29:00]</a>. The church's ability to retain influence is questioned, especially given its own problems and the presence of high-ranking officials who make decisions about its fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:05:00">[57:05:00]</a>. A skeptical view suggests that the church and occult practices "get along quite well and peacefully" in the modern niche of "cult services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:12:00">[58:12:00]</a>.

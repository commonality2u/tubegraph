The future political landscape of Russia is expected to undergo significant changes, marked by fundamental differences regarding the future paths of [[reforms_and_future_directions_for_russia | Russia's development]] and its future ideology [00:08:39]. Existing contradictions, which have long been present, are now surfacing and are considered irreconcilable within the framework of the current "Putin model" [00:09:00].

## Legal and Judicial Reforms

A new government is expected to implement substantial [[prison_and_legal_system_reform_in_russia | legal reforms]] immediately upon assuming power [00:09:37].

### Criminal Code Revisions
There is a plan to radically revise the Criminal Code, addressing the current imbalance where punishments for violent crimes are perceived as too soft, while minor offenses carry disproportionately long sentences, sometimes even exceeding those for murder [00:09:14]. Many articles are expected to be softened or entirely removed [00:09:27].

### Political Prisoners and Innocent Convictions
One of the very first actions of the new government will be the release of all [[judicial_reform_and_political_prisoners_in_russia | political prisoners]] and those unjustly convicted [00:09:46]. This includes individuals who suffered from blatant convictions, even if not under explicitly political articles [00:09:56]. These individuals will receive full rehabilitation, including financial compensation, rather than just amnesty [00:10:10].

### Restoration of Rights
A special agency will be established in Russia to focus on restoring the violated constitutional rights of Russian citizens [00:10:22].

## Future of Russian Governance
The revolutionary potential of the masses is considered an accompanying or background factor, not primary. Elite discontent is not solely linked to military actions but also to fundamental disagreements about Russia's future development paths and ideology [00:08:29]. There is a serious hope that after December 15th, the military course of the Russian Federation will gradually shift towards seeking a peaceful solution [00:05:46].

While past Russian history, such as the Time of Troubles (1905-1917) and the Russian-Japanese War, offers some parallels, the current situation is distinct due to the presence of a "double" and the internal elite crisis [00:26:27]. For the first time in Russia's history, this intra-elite dynamic has a chance to direct the country in a positive direction, acting in the interests of society and the country, rather than just specific groups [00:28:28].

## Indicators of Progress
Signs of progress will include:
*   The release of [[judicial_reform_and_political_prisoners_in_russia | political prisoners]] [00:29:02].
*   The cessation of blocking or slowing down platforms like YouTube and other social networks [00:29:05].
These changes will create an atmosphere where people can breathe more freely, although socio-economic improvement will have considerable inertia [00:29:29]. Experts predict economic recovery and improvements will become noticeable around the turn of the next year, with the country needing at least two years to recover from the crisis [00:30:00].

## Accountability for Propagandists and Informers
The actions of propagandists, whose work is considered massive and effective, can be classified under Russian criminal law [00:06:39]. While direct extradition to an international tribunal is not mentioned as a certainty, it is suggested that they would face justice within Russia's own "Basmanny justice" system [00:07:10]. The speaker emphasizes that propagandists will be held accountable, stating that their actions, like those of informers, will be brought to light and consequences will follow [00:11:41].

To effectively punish informers, their names and patronymics will be published on official websites [00:32:53]. This will allow citizens to morally sanction them by ceasing communication [00:33:58]. For those who suffered material losses due to false denunciations, legal action is encouraged, with confidence that victims would win such trials, and informers would be made to compensate for material losses [00:34:28]. The principled position is that the names of all informers will be revealed without exception [00:35:01].

## Media Transformation
After a change in power, Russian television will not become obsolete but its vector of activity will change by 180 degrees [00:35:51]. It is anticipated that television will begin to broadcast the truth, which will be an "amazing spectacle" [00:36:12].

## Return of Expatriates
It is expected that the overwhelming majority of people who left Russia due to military action and the "Putin regime" will return [00:38:10]. The "New Russia" will be fundamentally different from the one they left, offering opportunities they lacked or had taken away, which they could not find in the West [00:38:22]. Anyone who did not commit actual criminal offenses (outside the definition of the Putin system) will be able to return [00:37:43].

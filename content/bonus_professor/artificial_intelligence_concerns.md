From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

A question was posed to "Vladimir" by a student from St. Petersburg State University, inquiring about the dangers that [[future_predictions_and_societal_impact | artificial intelligence]] and neural networks might introduce into daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The student also asked if it was true that "Vladimir" had many doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

In response to the question about his alleged "doubles" and the concerns regarding AI, "Vladimir" stated that while someone might look like him and speak with his voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, he had decided that only one person should do so, and that person would be himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. He then humorously referred to [[future_predictions_and_societal_impact | artificial intelligence]] as his "first double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

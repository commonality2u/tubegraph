Valery Solovyov, a Doctor of Historical Sciences, political analyst, and public figure, discussed [[mobilization_and_legal_grounds | mobilization]] and its legal implications in the tenth episode of his program, "What is Happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He noted that [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mass mobilization]] is expected to be announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## What is Mobilization?
[[mobilization_and_military_efforts | Mobilization]] is defined as the transfer of a country's state structures, economy, and everyday life to a war footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Legal Framework
Decisions on [[mobilization_and_legal_grounds | mobilization]] can only be made by the President, relying on federal laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The key laws include:
*   Federal Law 31: The law on [[mobilization_strategies_and_preparations | mobilization preparation and mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Federal Constitutional Law on Martial Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   The law on [[military_service_and_mobilization_strategies | military duty and military service]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

New legal acts related to [[mobilization_and_legal_grounds | mobilization]] may also be adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Link to Martial Law
The decision to mobilize is "inextricably linked" with the introduction of martial law, regardless of which precedes the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Types of Mobilization
[[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | Mobilization]] may be partial, affecting specific territories of the Russian Federation, or full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. It is assumed that even if [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] begins as partial, it will likely develop into a full national [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Legal Grounds for Introducing Martial Law
Reasons for introducing martial law, as listed in the relevant law, include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>:
*   Bombing of Russian Federation territory by foreign armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   An attack by armed forces of a foreign state on the armed forces of the Russian Federation, regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Exile of armed gangs, groups, regular forces, and mercenaries by a foreign state to carry out aggression against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

It is suggested that all three points are already formally observable, providing legal grounds for introducing martial law and subsequent [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation has also stated that a provocation using chemical means from the Ukrainian side is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Who is Subject to Conscription?
Citizens in the reserve who do not have the right to a formal deferment are subject to conscription for [[military_service_and_mobilization_strategies | military service]] during [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

This includes:
*   **Men**: All men aged 18 to 50 years with a [[military_service_and_mobilization_strategies | military ID]] and a fitness category of "fully Fit" (A) or "Fit with minor restrictions" (B) can be mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **"Limited Fit" (V) Men**: Those with this category who do not serve in peacetime due to health problems but received a [[military_service_and_mobilization_strategies | military ID]] after 27 years can also be mobilized between 27 and 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Women**: Women with necessary education and a [[military_service_and_mobilization_strategies | military registration specialty]] are subject to conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This primarily includes medical education, but is not limited to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Categories of Reservists
Reservists are distributed into three categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>:
*   **First Category**: Men under 35 years old (privates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Second Category**: Men up to 45 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Third Category**: Men up to 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
Those in the first category will be called first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. It was suggested that those who support the "special military operation" (displaying the letter Z) should be in the first category and mobilized first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Exemptions and Deferments
The following individuals are generally not subject to conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>:
*   Those who have not served and have not received a [[military_service_and_mobilization_strategies | military ID]] up to 27 years old, as they are not considered to be in the reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

*   Those with an unexpunged or unexpunged conviction for a serious article (crime) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Petty hooliganism does not provide an exemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Individuals who received a category "D" at the draft board, meaning "generally not fit for [[military_service_and_mobilization_strategies | military service]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   Certain categories of citizens may be granted deferment by the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   Some exceptions for female military personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

It's noted that new legal acts could change these provisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## The Mobilization Process
### Orders and Summons
Citizens subject to conscription are obliged to appear at assembly points within specified timeframes once [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] orders are announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Orders can be delivered:
*   At home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   At the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
Summons may be presented by employees of the military registration and enlistment office, accompanied by a police patrol or Russian Guard patrol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Restrictions
Upon [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] announcement, those registered for [[military_service_and_mobilization_strategies | military service]] are prohibited from leaving their place of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. If they receive orders or a summons, they are obliged to appear at [[military_service_and_mobilization_strategies | military commissariats]] or other relevant authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Valid Reasons for Not Appearing
According to the federal law on [[military_service_and_mobilization_strategies | military duty]] and [[military_service_and_mobilization_strategies | military service]], valid reasons for not appearing on summons include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>:
*   Illnesses or circumstances leading to loss of ability to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   Serious health condition of certain relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   Death of relatives requiring participation in a funeral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Consequences of Evasion
In peacetime, failing to appear on a summons from the [[military_service_and_mobilization_strategies | military registration and enlistment office]] incurs administrative liability: a warning or a fine from 500 to 3000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Evasion of [[military_service_and_mobilization_strategies | military service]] (Article 328 of the Criminal Code) in peacetime provides for a fine of up to 200,000 rubles or imprisonment for up to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. The punishment in wartime is not explicitly stated but implies greater severity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.

## Practical Implications and Advice
[[issues_related_to_military_mobilization_and_its_impact | Mobilization]] will first affect residents of small and medium-sized cities, and only last of all large cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

### Financial and Travel Implications
Measures to encourage compliance include blocking bank accounts and cards of those subject to [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]], and closing travel abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

Regarding [[financial_implications_of_mobilization | financial implications]], advice is to transfer money to relatives' accounts or withdraw cash in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. It's noted that the people who promised the president to block accounts also said it would cause Russia to "finally plunge into financial hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.
For travel, it's advised to keep foreign passports in a safe, easily accessible place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### Call to Action
Individuals are urged to consider their strategies now, as there will be no time to think once [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] is announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.
[[mobilization_and_military_efforts | Mobilization]] is a transfer of the entire country, including the economy and financial system, to a military footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This includes potential confiscation of private assets like cars for transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

### [[social_and_national_implications_of_mobilization | Social and National Implications]]
The speaker emphasizes that Russia is a "model of social hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. He suggests that no one learns from history, calling Russia a "country of unlearned lessons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Viewers are encouraged to take the information about [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] seriously, take care of themselves and their families, and help others maintain common sense, moral fortitude, and human dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

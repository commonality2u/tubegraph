Russia's main source of foreign exchange income comes from its oil and gas exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. The ongoing conflict with Ukraine is anticipated to be prolonged, requiring substantial economic resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

## Decline in Oil Prices and Export Revenue

Recent data from Bloomberg indicated that Russian Urals oil, which constitutes two-thirds of [[russias_oil_price_and_export_strategy | Russian oil exports]], fell below $40 per barrel around January 6, 2023, reaching an exact price of $38.7 per barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This marked a record low since the summer of 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

The decline in oil prices directly leads to decreasing export revenues, creating significant budget problems for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Furthermore, the introduction of a price ceiling on oil from February 5, 2023, is projected to result in Russia losing an estimated $100 billion to $180 billion in foreign exchange earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Even if these figures are exaggerated, the losses for the budget are expected to be substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

## Governmental Response and Priorities

To compensate for these losses, the Russian government is expected to prioritize financing the armed forces and security agencies such as the Russian Guard, police, FSB, and Federal Protective Service to the maximum extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Conversely, social expenses and expenditures for economic development will be significantly reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>, a strategy described as "guns instead of oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

In an effort to offset the financial impact, Russia is attempting to increase [[russias_oil_price_and_export_strategy | oil exports]]. In January 2023, oil exports reportedly increased by one and a half times compared to December 2022, after a December setback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

These [[economic_challenges_in_russia_and_governmental_strategies | economic challenges]] are set against a backdrop of potential large-scale military events in the spring of 2023, for which both Russian and Ukrainian forces are preparing offensives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Russia is also preparing for a second stage of mobilization, potentially involving up to half a million people in the first wave, with a total aim of up to 2 million individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This indicates a long-term strategy for confrontation with Ukraine or the broader global community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

The current military conflict in Russia continues, resulting in casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. A fundamentally new military-political situation has arisen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Views on Ending the Conflict

Different factions within the Russian ruling group hold varying views on how to end the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>:
*   [[ukraine_russia_peace_talks_and_territorial_integrity | Patrushev's group]] believes a peace agreement should be concluded by recognizing the territorial status quo, where the current front line would become the new border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   [[prospects_of_a_truce_and_peace_negotiations_in_russian_military_conflicts | Chemezov's group]] supports a "very broad and very flexible compromise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

Peace will come after "the most decisive rearrangements," possibly even before, when both sides are ready for [[prospects_for_ending_the_russiaukraine_conflict | peace negotiations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. Currently, there is no such readiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

## Territorial Integrity and Borders

The new government aims to protect Russia's national interests and [[ukraine_russia_peace_talks_and_territorial_integrity | territorial integrity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

### Finland
Borders with Finland are expected to open "sooner or later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.

### Far East
The future of the Far East will critically depend on the nature of the new government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### Secessionist Tendencies
There are no influential forces in any region of Russia wishing to secede from Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.

### Baltic Countries
A hybrid operation in the Baltic countries, primarily targeting Latvia and Estonia, involves a military component for Lithuania's Suwa≈Çki Corridor as a "final part of the operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. If Belarus does not become a springboard for military or hybrid operations against the Baltic countries, travel from Russia to Belarus should be safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

### Cessions to China
Due to Russia's economic dependence on China, territories allegedly rented to China were "in fact actually transferred to China as new territories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:46">[00:39:46]</a>. This was the price for China's support and for not officially demanding compensation for the COVID epidemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>.

## Post-Transition Outlook

Under a new government, sanctions are expected to be lifted "quite quickly" due to ongoing high-level consultations with Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. Additionally, the substitution of Western products with Chinese ones is mitigating [[the_economic_situation_in_russia_and_its_future_prospects | technical degradation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

The speaker's team aims to "radically change the situation in the country," not just seize power, but fundamentally alter the foundations of society and the state in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. They believe the system "cannot" exist longer than expected, having "exhausted her internal margin of safety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. While the crisis is intensifying, the speaker believes they "will not allow the crisis to reach a catastrophe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.

The speaker is one of the public figures representing a "third coalition" whose goals in domestic and foreign policy are "noble and worthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Their objective is the development of Russian society and ensuring Russia's security and national interests exclusively through peaceful and civilized means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. The dynamics of change are developing "somewhat faster" than previously assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

The Russian authorities are discussing various scenarios for [[freezing_of_bank_deposits_in_russia | freezing bank deposits]] as a measure to address the threatening socio-economic catastrophe facing Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This is presented as a crucial aspect of the current [[russian_economic_crisis_and_forecasts | economic challenges]] in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Cypriot Scenario

The most intensively discussed and closest to implementation is the Cypriot scenario for [[freezing_of_bank_deposits_in_russia | freezing deposits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

### Essence of the Scenario
In this scenario, all funds exceeding the insurance amount are frozen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>. The current insurance amount in Russia is 1,400,000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This amount will be considered the total deposit per person, regardless of how many banks the funds are spread across <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

Funds above the 1,400,000 ruble threshold will be converted into bank shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. However, these shares will be frozen, meaning depositors will not be able to dispose of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

### Rationale and Expected Public Reaction
This scenario is being discussed because the majority of depositors in Russia have balances below the 1,400,000 ruble insurance limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. In 2022, 98.3% of people had deposits completely under 1,400,000 rubles, and this figure is now slightly less than 97.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

The state expects a neutral or even approving reaction from society, as the majority of the population would not suffer directly from this option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. It is anticipated that many might welcome it, believing it targets the wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

Deposits exceeding 10 million rubles account for almost one-third (31.1%) of the total amount of deposits, while those between 3 and 10 million rubles account for 15.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

### Limitations on Access
Even for the insured amount of 1,400,000 rubles, there will likely be restrictions on cash withdrawals and non-cash payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. Without such restrictions, the concept of [[freezing_of_bank_deposits_in_russia | freezing deposits]] would lose its meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

### Implementation
This measure is seen as the only alternative, with an elite consensus that it is absolutely necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. The exact timing of its launch is unknown, as it depends on the pace of the economic catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

The current Russian authorities intend to cope with the impending [[russian_economic_crisis_and_forecasts | economic catastrophe]] using "Old Soviet" or "Bolshevik patterns," which include deficits, food cards, special distributors, and "honestly" taking money from the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. The strategy is to get out of the crisis at the expense of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

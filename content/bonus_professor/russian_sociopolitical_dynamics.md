The world, including Russia, is currently undergoing a significant transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This shift began in the 1990s with the collapse of the Soviet model of socialism and is leading to a new, undefined quality of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The current global state is moving away from the clearly ordered world observed in the mid-1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Impact of Technological Revolution

A colossal technological revolution is occurring, which, according to some perspectives, is leading to a simplification and unification of human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. It is also seen as contributing to a decrease in the general level of intelligence, particularly noticeable in younger generations who have lost interest in the vast cultural heritage of European and world civilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The ability to read large texts, crucial for strategic thinking and planning, is becoming an "unsolvable task" for many young people, leading to a significant difference between those who can engage with complex information and those with a "goldfish memory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

This shift results in a future world with many restrictions, though people may not perceive them as such due to a lack of initial education and the will to acquire knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This new reality is described as a "huge illusion" or "simulacrum," where individuals lack the desire or will to "break through" to reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Elite Dynamics and Power Struggles

The contemporary [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | Russian political dynamics and power struggles]] are characterized by an elite that largely consists of the financial elite, which remains the dominant group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This elite is seen as hermetic and not inclined to expansion, preferring to maintain their status quo through closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

### Non-Public Organizations and Influence
Influential non-public organizations exist globally, often referred to as "secret" or "order type" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[0:11:25]</a>. These groups are distinct from entities like the Bilderberg Club, serving more as negotiating platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. They do not constitute a world government but have specific goals, often focusing on the "transformation of human nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.

The "cream of Western society" belongs to these organizations, but the "cream of Russian society" is not accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This exclusion stems from several reasons:
*   **Lack of consistent status**: Russian hopefuls are perceived as having shifted loyalties (e.g., from communists to Denikinites) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Lack of mission and historical responsibility**: Unlike members of these organizations who feel a "historical responsibility," their potential Russian counterparts do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.
*   **Perception of being thieves**: A powerful figure in Russia was told by Americans that he was a "thief" and no dialogue would be held with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Security officers ("Chekists") are also not trusted and deeply despised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

This distrust creates serious problems for Russian special services, as previous platforms for agreement with Western counterparts no longer function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. The Western view is that many within the [[russian_government_and_opposition_dynamics | Russian government and opposition dynamics]] are primarily motivated by money and power, seeking to "increase their fortune" and "strengthen positions of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.

### Internal Power Struggles and Elite Fears
Within the [[russian_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Russian political dynamics and leadership issues]], there is a "fierce fight of bulldogs under the carpet" among those vying for Putin's succession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. Key figures include Kovalchuk, Timchenko, Igor Sechin, and Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Even figures like Dmitry Medvedev and Sergey Shoigu are part of this dynamic, alongside Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. These struggles involve typical intrigues and, bizarrely, occult means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

#### Occultism in Russian Politics
Russian political figures, including ministers, are increasingly turning to shamans (Siberian, Latin American) and primitive interpretations of Orthodoxy for political guidance and to maintain their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. Practices include "shamanic journeys" and even "black rooster and black goat" sacrifices, where the heart is extracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. This demand for occult services has sharply increased since 2014, as those in power feel the ground shifting beneath them and seek any means to preserve assets and positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:10">[00:25:10]</a>.

The desire for occult assistance is not about seeking truth or knowledge, but purely about increasing fortune and power, or, more recently, how to save what they have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>. This suggests a deep insecurity and lack of internal meaning within the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.

### Elite's Insecurity and Use of Repression
The [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russian internal political dynamics]] are marked by insecurity among the elite, who "do not rule by right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. This self-doubt leads them to resort to brutal repression and harsh rhetoric to "instill in themselves confidence in their own strength" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>. They fear change, losing control, and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.

Fear of losing assets has driven the elite to transfer wealth into physical, tangible forms, such as tons of dollars and gold, often stored in inaccessible places like Africa and Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>. This is partly due to the belief that American intelligence can access digital or bank-held funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:48">[00:55:48]</a>. Yevgeny Prigozhin is cited as a key agent of the supreme power, involved in creating these physical storage bases in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>.

## Public Sentiment and Potential for Change

Despite the perceived stability, there is a "colossal request for change" in [[russian_domestic_political_situation | Russian domestic political situation]], shared by over two-thirds, possibly three-quarters, of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This level of demand for change was last seen in 1990-1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. There is also a significant "request for freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>.

However, there are no clearly expressed subjects of change with a "political face" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. The traditional concept of a "great sleeping Russian people" is no longer applicable, as urban populations think and feel differently, and their consciousness is highly virtualized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. Despite this, a high level of readiness for revolt exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.

### Triggers for Change
The dynamics of mass political change are unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>. While local protests (e.g., Khabarovsk, Bashkiria) demonstrate significant potential, a larger trigger is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>. This could be multiple local triggers occurring simultaneously or a strong national trigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

A potential national trigger is the economy. A rapid devaluation of the ruble (e.g., 30-40% in a week) followed by a denomination and exchange of banknotes could cause a "very strong mass reaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. Unlike the increase in retirement age, such an event could spark widespread unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

Another potential trigger lies within the [[russian_political_dynamics_amidst_leadership_changes | Russian political dynamics amidst leadership changes]]. As the internal power struggle intensifies, losing factions might resort to using societal resources, turning to the public for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. Once society is engaged, the situation becomes unpredictable and irreversible, akin to squeezing toothpaste from a tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.

## Fragility of the System and Future Outlook

The current system appears to lack a coherent meaning for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. It is characterized by mutually competing internal groups with differing tactics, not strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>. The supreme power is objectively fragile and depends on external influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>.

The non-public organizations mentioned previously have entered into conflict with Putin personally, a development that occurred relatively recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>. However, these external pressures alone cannot destroy the system, especially in an "inertial country like Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:27">[00:44:27]</a>. They believe in the principle of free will and recognize the limitations of manipulative mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

Ultimately, the fate of Russia will be decided by its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>. External forces can exert economic pressure and sanctions, but they cannot directly incite the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:09">[00:48:09]</a>. These non-public organizations are interested in maintaining "world harmony" and believe that the Kremlin has disrupted this balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>. The notion of a "world government" is seen as a cognitive problem and a sign of insecurity for Russian authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>. Their insecurity leads them to seek out powerful figures and believe in external forces pulling strings, rather than focusing on national interests or genuine legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

The [[russias_internal_political_dynamics_and_changes | Russia's Internal Political Dynamics and Changes]] are leading to a surprisingly eventful end to the current year and the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. The "main Russian question" remains "What to do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>. The answer is to act according to conscience, civic feeling, and responsibility to the people and homeland, and to do even more than currently being done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.

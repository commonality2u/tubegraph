Recent reports indicate a planned nationwide blocking of YouTube and WhatsApp in Russia, anticipated for August-September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This decision follows successful exercises aimed at slowing down and disrupting YouTube's normal functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. These exercises were carried out under the instructions of Nikolai Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, who is responsible for this sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

The proposed blocking will be a one-time, immediate measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, similar to previous actions taken against platforms like Facebook and Instagram, which are now banned in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## Reasons for the Blocking

The primary motivation behind blocking YouTube and WhatsApp is to curtail the opportunity for "protest mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. YouTube serves as a crucial source of information, while WhatsApp acts as a coordinator for actions and negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The authorities believe that such measures are necessary on the eve of anticipated "political problems" and "economic problems" in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, which are considered "inevitable" by monetary authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

Despite concerns, authorities anticipate that the blocking of YouTube itself will not trigger a mass negative "effective reaction" â€“ meaning, a reaction that escalates into significant actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. They view it as an additional factor of tension, but a risk worth taking to avoid more severe issues in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## Implications for Russian Citizens and Recommended Actions

The planned blocking has several implications for Russian citizens:

### Loss of Audience and Access
YouTube is expected to lose a significant portion of its audience, potentially 30-40%, similar to what happened with Instagram after its blocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This is partly due to fear of engaging with prohibited platforms and partly because many citizens lack the technical knowledge to circumvent restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### Restriction of VPN Information
The Russian authorities have decided to block any information or advertising that explains how to use VPNs, as well as technical instructions for their use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This falls under [[media_censorship_and_freedom_of_information_in_russia | repressive laws]] aimed at controlling [[information_iron_curtain_and_media_restrictions_in_russia | media restrictions in Russia]].

### Advice for Continued Access
To maintain access to information and communication, citizens are advised to:
*   **Acquire Reliable VPNs**: It is recommended to get one or more reliable VPNs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. While the government will attempt to block VPNs, it is described as an ongoing "battle of armor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Friends or acquaintances who already use VPNs can assist with finding and installing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Register on Telegram**: Telegram is not expected to be blocked due to past unsuccessful attempts and the belief that it is technically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Registering an account on Telegram and subscribing to relevant channels is highly recommended for receiving operational information during the anticipated critical situation this fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

These recommendations aim to mitigate the [[potential_impacts_on_russian_citizens | potential impacts on Russian citizens]] as [[cultural_and_political_repression_in_russia | cultural and political repression]] intensifies.

## Political and Economic Context

The planned blocking is set against a backdrop of anticipated "political problems" and "economic problems" in Russia this autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>. While the current public stage appears stable, intense, latent struggles are occurring behind the scenes, leading towards a political crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. The economic situation, despite official positive reports, is described as "extremely worrying to the authorities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

Discussions about potential new mobilizations have also returned to the agenda of the military leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. However, influential figures within the Russian leadership are reportedly against further mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. These developments highlight increasing internal pressures on the [[russian_government_changes | Russian government]].

The recent unrest and disputed presidential elections in [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] have significantly highlighted [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | Russian political dynamics]] and its influence in the region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. While the elections were not recognized by many European countries, including Ukraine, which did not congratulate Lukashenka, the situation remains highly uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Belarusian Revolution and External Factors

The ongoing protests in [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] are characterized as a revolution, not just unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. However, the internal "impulse of Belarusians" is considered insufficient to decisively overthrow Lukashenka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. An external factor is acknowledged, though its primary importance is downplayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. There is a group of American consultants in Warsaw attempting to aid the opposition, but their role is not decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The key impact on events comes from the [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## Proposed Compromise and Russian Control

A compromise is expected to emerge, with its formula discussed during telephone conversations between Putin and Lukashenka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The proposed compromise includes:
*   Lukashenka remaining President of [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] for no longer than one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   He announces early presidential elections after a new constitution is adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   During this period, he must sign a new union treaty with [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Lukashenka will not run in the early elections; Babarika is expected to be the candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] would gain a new, non-authoritarian president, while [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russia]] resolves the issue of control over [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   Lukashenka would move to Moscow and become secretary of the new State Council in [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

In the event of very strong pressure on Lukashenka, an option for early elections (possibly even this year) exists, but with the same predetermined results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Putin's Rhetoric on Intervention
Putin's statement that [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russia]] has prepared reserves to help Lukashenka is intended to force the Belarusian opposition and society into negotiating this compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This is seen as a warning or rhetorical figure, as neither Putin nor Lukashenka desires military intervention due to potential damage to relations between Russians and Belarusians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Putin had previously assured Merkel that [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russia]] would not introduce armed forces into [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. The "reserve" Putin referred to is not the army, but the Rosgvardiya and OMON (special police units) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Approximately 200-300 Rosgvardiya personnel are already in [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]], predominantly former Ukrainian Berkut fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Lukashenka's Future and Belarusian Sovereignty
Lukashenka's refusal to voluntarily leave his position, believing he was elected by his people, means that he would only be removed by force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. If he becomes an "insurmountable obstacle" to [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russian]] control over [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]], "troubles can befall him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. It is suggested that Lukashenka overestimates his ability to survive such a situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Should [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] sign the discussed union treaty, it would effectively become a "western province of the [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russian Federation]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] would lose 95% of its national powers to the union state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### Donbass Negotiations and Surkov's Return
Minsk remains the primary negotiating platform for the Donbass conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. While the [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | Russian]] delegation might be strengthened, and Vladislav Surkov could return to the Ukrainian policy direction, negotiations could be transferred to Almaty in extreme cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Surkov's potential return suggests a need to intensify the stalled negotiation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Putin was reportedly very unhappy with Surkov after a Normandy format meeting where the Ukrainian side refused to comply with prior agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Future of Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus Relations
The decisive factor in relations between [[russian_political_dynamics_amidst_leadership_changes | Russia]], Ukraine, and [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] will be an anticipated "powerful and radical political crisis" within the [[russian_political_dynamics_amidst_leadership_changes | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This crisis is expected to change the nature of [[russian_political_dynamics_amidst_leadership_changes | Russia's]] relations with its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. [[russian_political_dynamics_amidst_leadership_changes | Russia]] will likely be too preoccupied with internal problems, and with Putin's departure, a new leadership, agenda, and style of relations will emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Putin's Disregard for Domestic Issues
Despite intervening in [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]], Putin is perceived as indifferent to the people of the [[russian_domestic_political_situation | Russian Federation]], as evidenced by the lack of attention to protests in places like Khabarovsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. This indifference, which he once attempted to hide, is now more apparent due to his perceived tiredness and ill health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

### Navalny Poisoning and Political Unrest
The poisoning of Navalny is attributed to the Kremlin's extreme fear of political unrest and mass protests in the coming fall and early next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. The aim is to eliminate potential leaders capable of heading these protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. The Kremlin is not concerned about the international reaction to the Navalny case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. If international pressure increases, [[russian_government_and_opposition_dynamics | Russia]] might offer a joint investigation, but this would be a cynical maneuver, similar to the investigation into the Malaysian Boeing crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. [[russian_government_and_opposition_dynamics | Russian leadership]] has a direct order to obtain information on Navalny's health status as a priority, even before it is publicly released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. Putin personally decided that Navalny should be transported to Germany, even when no one was explicitly asking for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>.

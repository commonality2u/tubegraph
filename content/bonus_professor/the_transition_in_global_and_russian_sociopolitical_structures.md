## A Global Transition

There is a pervasive sense of a global transition, which began in the 1990s and is currently unfolding without significant bloodshed or major upheaval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This transition is largely linked to the collapse of the Soviet model of socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The pandemic is seen as having revealed this transition rather than solely initiating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Following Wallerstein, this transition is described as a shift from an old, established world quality to a new, yet undefined, one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. While the exact nature of this new world is unknown, individuals who act as "agents of change" can still influence its formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Characteristics of the Emerging World

The world is moving away from the clearly ordered structure observed in the mid-1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The peak of this structured world, characterized by "maturity and flourishing complexity," occurred in the 1960s, simplifying somewhat by the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

The ongoing [[Sociopolitical changes in Russia|technological revolution]], while colossal, is paradoxically leading to the simplification and unification of human nature and a decrease in intelligence levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Interest has shifted away from the "gigantic culture" developed by European and world civilization in the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Universities, historically anti-segregation tools, are transforming into instruments of segregation, with elite institutions becoming "new monasteries" preserving "sacred knowledge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The ability to read large texts and plan strategies is becoming a fundamental skill distinguishing people, as attention spans decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

In this future world, freedom will be significantly restricted, though people may not perceive it as such if they are "limited initially" and lack the will to acquire knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This world, permeated with gamification, is described as a "huge illusion" or "simulacra" where people lack the desire or will to "break through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The philosophical concept of "the world as will and representation" by Schopenhauer remains profoundly relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This future resembles Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World," where individuals are so integrated into the system that their individual existence disappears or becomes criminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## Elites and Their Influence

The emerging world will have "gentlemen," largely comprising the global financial elite, who remain the dominant group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. These circles are not inclined to expansion and prefer to maintain their status quo through a form of closure, especially noticeable in Anglo-Saxon and, to a lesser extent, European societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

Influential "non-public organizations," numbering about a dozen and a half, exist outside public view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. These are not a world government, but their goals extend beyond acquiring wealth, focusing on understanding and transforming human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. These organizations are often very old, "order-type" groups, and include the "cream of Western society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

The "cream of Russian society" is generally not accepted into these influential circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Reasons for this exclusion include:
*   Their lack of a consistent, principled status (e.g., shifting from communists to Denikin followers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   A perceived lack of mission or historical responsibility, unlike their Western counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
*   Being seen as "thieves," which leads to a refusal of dialogue from Westerners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This applies to Russian security officers as well, who are deeply despised by these Western groups, leading to serious problems for professional activities and a breakdown of negotiation platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.

While some wealthy Russians aspire to leave a positive mark in history, they are deterred by the current system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. A special department within the FSB, created in 2012 after the Bolotnaya Square unrest, monitors the top 100-150 wealthiest Russians, focusing on any political investment or support against the presidential administration's will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. Violations are met with severe threats, with the example of Khodorkovsky serving as a stark warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics and Potential for Change in Russia

Beneath the financial elite, a significant middle-class bureaucracy desires change but is unwilling to risk their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.

### Power Struggles and Occultism
Currently, a "fierce fight of bulldogs under the carpet" is taking place for [[internal_russian_political_dynamics_and_changes|Putin's succession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. Key figures involved include Kovalchuk, Timchenko, Igor Ivanovich, Patrushev, Medvedev, Sergey Kuzhugetovich, and Sobyanin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. Beyond typical intrigues, these power struggles also involve occult means, with individuals turning to shamans (Siberian, Latin American) and even engaging in practices like the ritualistic sacrifice of black roosters and black goats to extract their hearts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. This demand for occult services has sharply increased since 2014, as the elite feel the situation changing and their status quo threatened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. Their interest in occultism is driven by a desire to preserve assets and positions, not to seek truth or knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:22">[00:27:22]</a>.

Russian authorities frequently try to legitimize their power by selectively invoking historical figures like Stalin, Nikolai II, Kolchak, Denikin, and Mannerheim, despite their contradictory historical positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. However, they actively oppose Lenin due to his association with the destruction of the status quo and the old order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>.

### The System's Vulnerabilities
The current system lacks an internal "meaning of development" and is becoming increasingly inefficient due to internal conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>. Attempts to strengthen public administration through repression, such as arresting governors, paradoxically lead to the paralysis of the state apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

A "colossal request for change" and freedom exists within Russian society, shared by over two-thirds, possibly three-quarters, of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. This level of demand for [[change_in_the_political_landscape_in_russia|change in the political landscape in Russia]] was last seen in 1990-1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. However, there are no clearly defined political subjects or a "great sleeping Russian people" to awaken and mobilize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. Russian political and cultural life is characterized by a "quasi-sectarianism," where loyalty to a particular group dictates promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>.

The regime's brutal tone and repressive tactics stem from a deep-seated self-doubt and fear of change and losing control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>. They also fear the West, realizing that certain values and organizations cannot be "cut off" or controlled through corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>. This insecurity leads them to search for "real rulers of this world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.

### Potential Triggers for Change
Despite the appearance of stability, the potential for protest is significant, as shown by local incidents like Khabarovsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. A "trigger" is needed to ignite widespread protests. Possible national triggers include:
*   **Economic Collapse**: A rapid and significant devaluation of the ruble (e.g., by 30-40% in a week) followed by a denomination and exchange of banknotes could cause a very strong mass reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.
*   **Political Transit**: As the "bulldogs under the carpet" realize one of them is losing the power struggle, they may use external resources and "turn to society," making the game unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. The leadership is not prepared for war, unlike in 2014, due to Vladimir Putin's diminished engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.

The experience of Belarus, where a highly cemented system suddenly faced massive, prolonged protests, demonstrates the unpredictability of mass political dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:40">[00:37:40]</a>.

### The Role of Non-Public Organizations and Free Will
Influential non-public organizations have entered into conflict with the Kremlin elite since around 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:53">[00:44:53]</a>. They operate through individuals and institutions within Russia and exert economic pressure through sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:28">[00:45:28]</a>. However, they are ultimately supporters of the principle of free will and recognize the limitations of manipulative mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>. They are interested in maintaining a global balance or "world harmony" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:54">[00:48:54]</a>.

The existence of a "world government" is dismissed due to the inherent impossibility of organizing it and the enduring power of free will, especially the sovereignty of the people, which is "capable of destroying everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:37">[00:49:37]</a>. The main problem for the Russian authorities is their insecurity and lack of legitimate rule, which leads them to seek "real rulers" and resort to brutal tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

### Future Outlook
Russia is expected to experience a "surprisingly eventful end of this year and next year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. The fate of the country will ultimately be decided by the peoples of Russia, who, despite appearances, are experiencing extreme irritation with the authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>. Many Russian elites are transferring their assets abroad into physical forms (tons of dollars and gold) as a result of their fear of losing their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>. Areas like Africa and Latin America are serving as new safe havens for these physical assets and Russian bases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:56">[00:55:56]</a>.

In response to the fundamental question, "What to do?", the answer is to act according to one's conscience, civic feeling, and sense of responsibility to the people and homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

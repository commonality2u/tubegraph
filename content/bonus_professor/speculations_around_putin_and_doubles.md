## The Presence of Doubles
The existence of [[allegations_of_putins_double | Putin's doubles]] has been a subject of discussion, with a study, or at least a part of it, reportedly published by *The Moscow Times*, which republished information from the *Daily Mail Sun* with a link to Japanese researchers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. This study included an anthropological examination comparing different "Putins" and a phonoscopic examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:06">[06:09:06]</a>. The phonoscopic examination is considered as reliable as fingerprints and reportedly confirmed the presence of [[putins_doubles_theory | doubles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

## Types and Roles of Doubles
It is claimed that in addition to "Vasilich," identified as the double replacing the late president, there is another "technical double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. This technical double was allegedly used for public appearances where the president did not need to speak, such as "walk-throughs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. The Federal Protective Service (FSO) is said to control this double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### The Watch Anomaly
A specific observation regarding a "Putin" figure not wearing a watch on his left hand during a meeting on October 30th (initially thought to be September 30th) was raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:02">[01:06:02]</a>. However, it was suggested that the current double of [[vladimir_putin_and_information_noise | Putin]] might have a habit of removing his watch from his right hand and putting it down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. This detail was not considered to hold significant importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## Connection to Putin's Alleged Death
The claims of [[putins_doubles_theory | Putin's doubles theory]] are intertwined with [[speculation_on_putins_death_and_political_implications | speculation on Putin's death]]. It is asserted that the president died on the evening of October 26th, around midnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. The FSO conducting exercises from November 1st to 3rd, which included the deliberate mention of using armored vehicles, was associated with this alleged death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

It is also claimed that the preparation for [[speculation_on_putins_death_and_political_implications | Putin's death]] was underway, and the approximate day was known, with the prediction error being only three or four days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Political Implications of Doubles
The existence of doubles has significant [[the_role_of_doubles_and_misinformation_in_russian_politics | political implications]]. The current "supreme ruler of Russia" is stated to be Nikolai Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. The Patrushev team, now in power, is expected to tighten control, especially "on the eve of the transfer of power," as a double cannot lead Russia for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

The West, China, and Israel are allegedly aware of these events and are satisfied with the current state of affairs, interested in maintaining the current regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>. The Ukrainian side, including its leadership and intelligence, has not made statements regarding [[speculation_on_putins_death_and_political_implications | Putin's death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. This could be due to fear of making a mistake, or because Ukrainian intelligence might not be strong in strategic political intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>. Another assumption is that Ukrainian leadership might be afraid, as confirmation of [[speculation_on_putins_death_and_political_implications | Putin's death]] could alter peace negotiations, removing a stated obstacle for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.

## Information Sources
The "General SVR" Telegram channel is cited as supplying "first-class and the best of all possible information about the real state of affairs behind the scenes of the Kremlin," described as "absolutely reliable" due to its information being confirmed multiple times from other sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

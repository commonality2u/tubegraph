The 126th issue of the "What is Happening" program, hosted by Valery Solovey, which aired on Monday, June 3 at 1:00 PM Moscow time, highlighted several key topics including the construction of a new configuration of power, the return of Yevgeny Prigozhin to Russia, and the strikes on Russia, their reasons, and their strategic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Possibility of Strikes on Russian Territory

The recent allowance for strikes on "root Russian territory" (excluding new territories and Crimea, which the West does not recognize as sovereign Russian territory) marks a significant shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. The Ukrainian Armed Forces have previously struck military and infrastructure facilities in Crimea, including fuel and energy complex facilities, for a considerable time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

The ability for these strikes to occur now, on such a massive and hasty scale, is attributed to a fundamental change in the perception of Russia by Western powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. The West has "opened the box" because they understand that Russia's former leader, whom they feared due to his perceived clinical instability and willingness to initiate global conflict, is no longer present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

### The Role of Leadership Change

The departure of the "living Putin" is cited as the root cause for the change in Western strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. The current ruling group in Russia is seen by the West as more realistic and unwilling to engage in a thermonuclear war that would destroy the world, including themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. This perception has led to a more confident and "carefree" approach from American officials, who state they see no signs of Russia preparing for nuclear strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

Western allies of the United States interpret this as broader opportunities for Ukraine to use supplied weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. The risks of escalation have decreased compared to a year or even six months ago when the former leader was alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. It is asserted that he "left this mortal world" on October 26 last year at 20:42 Moscow time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>.

## Strategic Consequences of Strikes

The massive use of Western weapons to attack Russian military facilities and critical infrastructure will not lead to a strategic turning point in the conflict, nor will it result in Ukraine winning the military confrontation with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. However, these strikes are capable of:
*   Weakening the Russian offensive impulse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   Causing serious damage to the Russian armed forces and their logistics, especially if Russia is preparing for a new offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

Ultimately, the situation is expected to return to a [[military_and_strategic_implications_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | strategic impasse]] by the turn of summer and autumn, similar to the one observed in September of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. This renewed strategic impasse may incentivize a transition to direct peaceful consultations between Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

### Peace Negotiations and Internal Dynamics

Russia previously made an offer for peaceful consultations to Ukraine via Western allies, but it was rejected about a month prior due to unacceptable conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. It is hypothesized that by September, the perception of the situation might change on both the Ukrainian and Russian sides, leading to increased readiness for a "very broad compromise" from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>.

Additionally, the internal political dynamics within the Russian Federation, specifically the ongoing transition of power, could influence Ukraine's readiness for peace talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. If this transition unfolds in an unforeseen and destructive way for the system, Ukraine's strategic position could be impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Various politicians have begun discussing the concept of collective responsibility and guilt among Russians for current events, leading to a feeling of guilt emerging in public consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Rejection of Collective Guilt
Valery Solovey explicitly states he does not support the concepts of collective guilt or collective responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. He argues that if everyone is guilty, then no one is, which dilutes accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Emphasis on Individual Accountability
Solovey aligns with the viewpoint articulated by Bolshevik leaders in the mid-1930s, particularly Lazar Kaganovich, that "every mistake has a last name, first name, and patronymic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. He extends this principle to crimes and criminals, asserting that individuals must and will be held personally accountable to the full extent of the law for their mistakes and crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Public Understanding and Silence
Regarding the question of why Russians seemingly do not understand where their leadership is taking them, it is suggested that some do not understand because they do not want to, as people are afraid to imagine the consequences of certain actions and policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Others may understand but choose to remain silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This highlights [[the_psychology_and_consequences_of_consensus_and_dissent_in_russian_society|the psychology and consequences of consensus and dissent in Russian society]].

## Future Relations with Ukrainians
The speaker notes that it will be very difficult to rebuild human ties between Ukrainians and citizens of the Russian Federation once military actions cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>. Economic ties may recover relatively quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>, but human connections are unlikely to recover fast, if at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. In the eyes of Ukrainians and through Ukrainian society's socialization, Russia and Russians are likely to be perceived as a source of evil and threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. This outlook suggests that [[impact_of_the_conflict_on_russian_society|nothing good can be expected in relations between societies]] if socialization continues in this spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. However, there is still hope, as historical examples like the Germany-France relationship show that even after destructive wars, relations can be established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

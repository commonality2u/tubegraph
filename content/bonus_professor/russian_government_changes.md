The 123rd episode of "What is Happening," aired on Monday, May 13th, focuses on the recent changes within the Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The speaker asserts that their analytical predictions regarding these changes, made over several months, have proven accurate to an extent of 85-90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This accuracy is attributed to the skillful use of insider information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Debunking the "Predetermined" Narrative

Contrary to popular claims, the appointment of Mikhail Mishustin as Prime Minister of the Russian Federation was not predetermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The speaker has consistently covered the real dynamics of this process publicly and in closed speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## The Rival Coalitions

The recent changes are largely a result of an intense struggle between two main elite coalitions: the [[chemezov_coalition | Chemezov coalition]] and the [[patrushev_coalition | Patrushev coalition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This conflict, involving other elite groups, will continue to define [[russian_political_landscape_and_potential_changes | domestic Russian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### Initial Plans for Dmitry Patrushev

From late November to mid-February, it was understood that [[dmitry_patrushev | Dmitry Patrushev]] was slated to become Prime Minister, with a radical renewal of the government by 75-80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Furthermore, [[dmitry_patrushev | Dmitry Patrushev]] was expected to become the heir of the so-called "President Putin," who the speaker identifies as a double, "Yevgeny Vasilyevich, a carpenter from Mogilev" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Chemezov's Opposition and Stalemate

By mid-February, the [[patrushev_coalition | Patrushev coalition]]'s plans faced strong, seemingly insurmountable resistance from the [[chemezov_coalition | Chemezov coalition]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The [[chemezov_coalition | Chemezov coalition]] categorically opposed [[dmitry_patrushev | Dmitry Patrushev]] becoming Prime Minister and eventually President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This led to a stalemate, with [[nikolai_patrushev | Nikolai Patrushev]]'s candidate being [[dmitry_patrushev | Dmitry Patrushev]], and the [[chemezov_coalition | Chemezov coalition]]'s candidate being [[denis_manturov | Denis Manturov]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Each group blocked the other's preferred candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Compromise Candidates

Several compromise options were considered:
*   **Anton Vaina:** Head of the presidential administration, who refused the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Unnamed security official:** The second compromise candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Alexey Dyumin:** Appeared as a candidate in the "last days" before the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### China's Influence

A significant factor in Mishustin's appointment was China's advocacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Chinese officials insisted on Mishustin as Prime Minister because President Xi Jinping personally liked him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Mishustin also promised to fulfill all obligations to China assumed by the "late President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. China conditioned the visit of the "double of the late President Putin" to Beijing in mid-May on Mishustin's appointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This external influence causes "very strong irritation" among the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## The New Government Structure and Compromise

The resulting compromise involved various appointments and shifts in power:

### Vice-Premiers

As a compromise, both [[denis_manturov | Denis Manturov]] (from the [[chemezov_coalition | Chemezov coalition]]) and [[dmitry_patrushev | Dmitry Patrushev]] (from the [[patrushev_coalition | Patrushev coalition]]) became vice-premiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. [[denis_manturov | Denis Manturov]] was appointed First Vice-Premier, while [[dmitry_patrushev | Dmitry Patrushev]] became a regular Vice-Premier, indicating a slight improvement in the [[chemezov_coalition | Chemezov coalition]]'s position in the socio-economic part of the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Nikolai Patrushev's New Role

As part of the "rotten compromise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, [[nikolai_patrushev | Nikolai Patrushev]] was promised that by the end of the year, [[dmitry_patrushev | Dmitry Patrushev]] would become the new Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. The timeline for [[dmitry_patrushev | Dmitry Patrushev]]'s eventual transformation into president has been conditionally postponed to "winter spring" from the initial fall 2024 expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

[[nikolai_patrushev | Nikolai Patrushev]] has moved "into the shadows," a condition of the compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Despite leaving the post of Secretary of the Security Council, he maintains control over the security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that the person is more important than the position in the Russian political landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

### Shoigu and Belousov

The arrest of [[timur_ivanov | Timur Ivanov]], a deputy of the Ministry of Defense, was initially intended to extend to [[sergei_shoigu | Sergei Shoigu]], the Minister of Defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. While the speaker did not know who Shoigu's successor would be, the high probability of Shoigu's removal and the purge of his deputies were predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. [[sergei_shoigu | Sergei Shoigu]]'s appointment as Secretary of the Security Council is described as an "absolute void" because [[nikolai_patrushev | Nikolai Patrushev]]'s first deputy, Nurgaliev, will control affairs there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

## Ongoing Turbulence and Future Outlook

The "unstable balance" between the two coalitions has been largely preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. However, this "rotten compromise" is not considered long-term by any party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

### China's Role and Elite Irritation

Russia's critical dependence on China, militarily and economically, for its military operations and economic stability is widely understood by the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. However, the "humiliation" of China dictating terms and influencing key appointments is a source of "very strong internal tension" within the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

### Short-term Compromise and Future Conflict

The current compromise is fragile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. The internal tension between the two coalitions will "inevitably soon be discharged" in a "most direct and immediate form," leading to bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. The speaker anticipates a sharp increase in turbulence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

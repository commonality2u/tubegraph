The program, recorded on December 25th, discusses the latest developments concerning Russia's special military operation, including comparisons between the leaders, preparations for a decisive battle, planned mobilization, and the meaning of victory for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Putin's PR Strategy and Ukraine's Advantage

Ukrainian President Zelensky is perceived to "completely outplay" Russia in terms of public relations, forcing Russian leadership to respond with their own semblance of PR events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The initiative in the foreign policy arena, where reputation and image are formed, is currently with the Ukrainian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Putin, despite his disdain for Zelensky, is compelled to follow his lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The speaker suggests that a copy is always inferior to the original, leaving the audience to decide who the true leader is in this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Preparations for a Decisive Battle

Both sides are concentrating forces for what is anticipated to be a decisive battle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Ukraine's Strategic Offensive

Ukraine is expected to receive significant military aid from NATO countries and allies in the near future, including:
*   2,000 tanks and other armored vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>
*   More than 800 artillery systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   Over 2 million shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>
*   More than 20 multiple launch rocket systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>

This aid is intended to enable Ukraine to launch a strategic offensive aimed at reaching its state borders with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Russia's Response and Tactics

Russia's response includes:
*   **Strikes on Energy Infrastructure**: Attacking Ukraine's energy system to cause de-energization, disorganization of industry, demoralization of Ukrainian society, public pressure on President Zelensky, and a new wave of emigration to European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Weapon Procurement**: Russia anticipates receiving new weapon systems from Iran, primarily ballistic missiles, with the first batch potentially transferred before the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This is expected to be one of several batches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Russia and Iran are expected to deny these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
*   **[[russian_mobilization_and_military_actions | Mobilization]]**: A key response is the [[russian_mobilization_and_military_actions | mobilization]] and concentration of manpower, as Russia relies on numerical advantage due to a lack of modern advanced weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This strategy mirrors mid-20th century tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Discussions at the Ministry of Defense about changing service terms and increasing numbers are seen as propaganda preparation for a new [[russian_mobilization_and_military_actions | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The Kremlin believes that a quantitative advantage is essential for victory or honorable peace terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

## Planned Mobilization and Challenges

Following the New Year holidays, a new phase of [[russian_mobilization_and_military_actions | mobilization]] is expected, potentially accompanied by partial border closures for those within the [[russian_mobilization_and_military_actions | mobilization]] base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The mobilization base is estimated to include about 7 million people, with a target of 2 million mobilized, including 300,000 women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

Mobilized personnel are expected to be sent almost immediately to the front lines without preliminary training, as Russia lacks the organizational and technical capacity for full-fledged training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This limitation was acknowledged at the defense session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.

Sociological data available to the Kremlin suggests that while the population dislikes [[russian_mobilization_and_military_actions | mobilization]], they are resigned to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Yevgeny Prigozhin, known for recruiting from prisons, proposed using both male and female prisoners, and even patients from neuropsychiatric dispensaries, for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. These individuals are intended to help create the "Surovikin line," a defensive fortification to withstand Ukraine's strategic offensive, after which Russia plans its own counteroffensive, potentially using Belarusian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

## Redefining Victory

The definition of "victory" for Russia's special military operation has evolved.

### Previous and Current Stated Goals

Initially, goals included "demilitarization" and "denazification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Putin has since stated a new goal: "the unification of the Russian people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. This latter goal raises concerns among sovereign countries, particularly those with Russian populations (Kazakhstan, Baltic states, Ukraine), as it implies an aggressive expansionist policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. The speaker argues that Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians are distinct peoples, despite ethnic and cultural similarities, and that Russia's actions have driven away rather than unified them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

### Timeline for Victory

China has reportedly set conditions for engaging with Putin, demanding a plan for completing the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. According to a summary of Putin's message, Russia aims for a "final victory" no later than mid-summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. This victory is interpreted as acquiring or controlling new territories and entering peace negotiations, potentially leading to a truce, ceasefire, or even a peace treaty by mid-summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. The speaker finds this timeline "extremely dubious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## International Implications

China's stance towards Russia has implications for [[impact_of_international_relations_on_russias_military_strategy | Russian military strategy]]. China's largest sea transportation operator, China Cosco, has refused to transport oil from Russia since December 5th, following the introduction of an oil price cap and export restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This indicates that China is not only demanding reports on [[russian_military_operations_in_ukraine | Russia's military actions]] but also treating Russia in a subservient manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

The speaker concludes that Russia has entered a "strategic trap" regarding Ukraine, and that its current policies are counterproductive, causing wariness globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. Despite the bleak outlook, the speaker notes that being "alive and at liberty" is considered happiness by modern Russian standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>.

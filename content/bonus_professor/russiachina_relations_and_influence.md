## Current State of Relations
[[Chinas influence on Russian politics | China]] exerts a significant influence on [[Russian diplomacy and international relations | Russia]], more than some would prefer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>. [[Russian diplomacy and international relations | Russia]] currently plays the role of a junior partner in its relationship with [[Chinas influence on Russian politics | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>.

### Economic Dependence and Exploitation
Evidence of this relationship includes "horrific photographs, videos about how the Siberian taiga is being cut down... and is supplied to [[Chinas influence on Russian politics | China]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a>. Currently, there is a dependence on [[Chinas influence on Russian politics | China]], though it is not yet considered a "vassal dependence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>.

[[Chinas influence on Russian politics | China]] has been quite successful in corrupting [[influence and interests of foreign countries in Russian politics | Russian officials]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:44">[00:56:44]</a>. An anecdote suggests that in the late 2000s, when Japanese companies tried to make a large deal with [[Russian diplomacy and international relations | Russia]] and paved the way through [[influence and interests of foreign countries in Russian politics | Russian officials]], the deal fell through because the Chinese "outdid the Japanese" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>.

### Political Factions and Interests
There is a "Chinese party" within [[Russian politics]], led by Igor Ivanovich Sechin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. This faction's interests are tied to [[Russia and Chinas economic agreements | economic interests]] such as oil exports and a general orientation towards [[Chinas geopolitical stance and its impact on Russia | China's political model]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:28">[00:56:28]</a>.

## Future Outlook
To overcome this dependence on [[Chinas influence on Russian politics | China]], [[Russian diplomacy and international relations | Russia]] would need to establish "good relations with the European Union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:34">[00:53:34]</a>, which also fears "excessive strengthening of [[Chinas influence on Russian politics | China]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:38">[00:53:38]</a>.

Given [[Russian diplomacy and international relations | Russia]]'s longest land border with [[Chinas influence on Russian politics | China]], resistance or a response to [[Chinas geopolitical stance and its impact on Russia | China's challenge]] could be achieved by fostering good relations in the Far East and Pacific region with the United States, Japan, and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:05">[00:54:05]</a>. If [[Russian diplomacy and international relations | Russia]] were to focus on its internal development rather than pursuing "crazy ambitions," the "problem of [[Chinas influence on Russian politics | China]] will be solved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>.

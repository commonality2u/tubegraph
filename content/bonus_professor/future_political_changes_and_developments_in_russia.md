Valery Solovey discusses various aspects concerning [[future political changes in Russia | future political changes]] and developments, including the transition of power, potential new leadership, and societal transformations.

## Transition of Power

It is asserted that the current president's "doubles" will not ultimately rule Russia, although they might temporarily replace the current president for a short period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The doubles reportedly appeared in the second decade of the 21st century and were used more intensively after the Crimean annexation in 2014, and even more so from 2020 to replace the current president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. The current top officials carry out the operational management and make important decisions within their competence, as the president is described as "weak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes a process of "delegitimization of power" where trust in the authorities diminishes, which is considered the first step to dismantling current power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. The elite is aware of the wide use of doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. There is an expectation of "decisive movements" by the end of the current year from within the elite, who are currently paralyzed by fear of each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

## New Leadership and Governance

A group aiming for power, which the speaker identifies with, is comprised "almost exclusively" of people who prioritize the Motherland, Fatherland, and people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Such individuals are even present in the current Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

The only guarantee for adequate people to come to power and work in society's interests is "direct participation in the political crisis" and creating public guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Subsequent developments like separation of powers and parliamentary democracy are established later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

Regarding the reorganization of state administration, a new constitution will be adopted, establishing a new Russian Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. This constitution will include transitional provisions for a period estimated at 10-12 years, during which Russia will likely be a presidential republic with restrictions based on existing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. After this transitional period, a referendum will be held to determine if Russia becomes a parliamentary or presidential republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. It's noted that transforming Russia into a parliamentary republic immediately is impossible due to the lack of a full-fledged parliament and parties, which would take 10-12 years to create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.

Forces connecting the [[future political changes in Russia | future of the country]] with the development of intellectual potential, science, industry, education, and medicine exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Key Policies and Reforms

*   **Industrialization**: A primary task of the new government will be to ensure the "secondary industrialization of the country," including starting production where possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This means continued work for those in manufacturing and aviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Judicial Reform**: Russia "needs it like air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. The reform includes:
    *   Broad amnesty with rehabilitation for people wrongly convicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Up to a quarter of prisoners are estimated to be there illegally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
    *   Unconditional lustration of the judicial corps, implemented gradually but fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
    *   Changes to the judicial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The judicial reform project is already developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.
*   **Migration and Ethnic Criminal Groups**: The problem is deemed solvable, currently lacking "goal-setting" and "political will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Proposed solutions involve:
    *   Migrants only being in Russia where needed by the Russian economy and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>.
    *   Quantities not exceeding needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.
    *   Directing migrants to specific regions with job needs, like the Arctic Circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   **Status of Kadyrov's Army**: It is believed that stopping funding for Kadyrov's group will "definitely not lead to such a scenario" as Prigozhin's uprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>, implying existing solutions for disarming them.
*   **National Flag**: The speaker has no definite point of view on changing the flag, suggesting it could be kept (like Germany's) or a new one adopted, citing the flag of the Russian ship Orel as a personal preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

## External Relations and Conflicts

Regarding the armed conflict with Ukraine, some forces planning to come to power after Putin are ready to quickly end the war, while others are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Some security forces may consider escalating the conflict to improve their bargaining position for peace negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. If the Ukrainian offensive is defeated, Russian armed forces have the "technical possibility" to go on a counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

Friendship between Russia and Ukraine is not expected, but "pragmatic relations can well be built and quite quickly" within our lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

The [[future political and social changes in Russia | future]] of South Ossetia and Abkhazia will be decided after the end of the [[future political changes in Russia | political crisis in Russia]], through "difficult political negotiations" with all interested parties, which is unlikely to be resolved quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.

## Societal Impact and Advice

The speaker asserts that the revelation of the current regime's inner workings will not undermine the people's desire to participate in politics; instead, it will strengthen it by demonstrating a government capable of self-purification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. Making past mistakes and crimes public is intended to guarantee they won't be repeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

For citizens concerned about personal finances and [[future challenges in Russia | future stability]], it's advised to:
*   Keep savings in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.
*   Be prepared for inflation to reduce savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
*   Buy foreign currency if possible, as the banking system can quickly develop after the crisis, allowing for currency deposits or conversion to rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.
*   Consider real estate as a good idea for passive income through renting, but with a "very long payback horizon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. The goal is to save, not necessarily increase, money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>.

For those abroad considering returning to Russia, the speaker advises basing the decision on individual temperament and willingness to participate in "undoubtedly" occurring events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. If one wishes to participate, returning in the fall is suggested; if one prefers to save themselves for a "beautiful Russia of the future," waiting is understood and deemed a worthy position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

Valery Solovey, in the 12th episode of his program, addressed questions concerning [[the_state_of_the_russian_economy_and_financial_measures | Russia's financial system]] and its future outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Current Assessment of the Financial Block

The work of the financial block, including Nabiullina and Siluanov, is rated as "highly successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. They are credited with saving [[the_state_of_the_russian_economy_and_financial_measures | Russia]] from a [[economic_crisis_and_currency_valuation_in_russia | financial catastrophe]] in the past year and the beginning of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This success, however, only means the catastrophe has been delayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Future Economic Outlook

According to Nabiullina's assessment, which she reportedly shares with the president, a "white furry animal" (a euphemism for disaster) is stealthily approaching the [[the_state_of_the_russian_economy_and_financial_measures | Russian financial and banking system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The safety margin of this system is expected to last until summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. While nothing extraordinary usually happens in the summer, the 1998 default occurred during this season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Very serious [[economic_forecast_and_challenges_in_russia | problems]] are anticipated in the fall, based on Nabiullina's assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Despite the competence of Nabiullina and Siluanov in saving the system, a negative effect is still expected, albeit delayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

## Digital Currency

The speaker does not believe the issue of digital currency, specifically the digital ruble set to come into effect on March 20, will have a significant or dangerous impact on daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. He advises against listening to "idiotic conspiracy theories" regarding its impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

## Background and Predictions
The detention of Timur Ivanov has prompted questions regarding its timing, especially given that his alleged corruption was reportedly known for a long time [00:01:12]. The speaker had previously indicated that the detention of Ivanov, along with certain other deputy ministers of defense or internal affairs, would not be surprising [00:01:21]. This was mentioned in online meetings held before the New Year and in February of the current year [00:01:42]. Specifically, during an online meeting on February 15, titled "the burning issue under the carpet," it was stated that nearly all deputy defense ministers would be removed [00:01:51]. This prediction was made more than two months before Ivanov's actual detention [00:02:32].

## Broader Implications and Purges
The removal of deputy defense ministers, including Ivanov, is described as part of a plan to update the defense department, increase its efficiency, and punish those responsible for failures, mistakes, and abuses committed by the department before and after February 24, 2015 [00:02:06]. The arrest of Timur Ivanov is presented as a visible manifestation of a split within the elite and a political crisis within the [[russian_domestic_political_situation | Russian domestic political situation]] [00:19:36]. This aligns with discussions about a broader [[russian_military_arrests_and_conspiracies | purge]] impacting "Ministry barons" [00:03:33].

## Related Personnel Changes
Regarding the fate of Sergei Shoigu, discussions on February 15 suggested he should be removed from his post as Minister of Defense and become the head of the Russian Guard instead of General Zolotov [00:02:51]. This move was characterized as a "show resignation" [00:03:11]. The opinion of those governing Russia, particularly [[russian_military_arrests_and_conspiracies | Nikolai Patrushev]], has reportedly shifted, with Shoigu now not being opposed to leaving his current position, even amidst the ongoing [[internal_purges_in_the_fsb_and_implications_for_russian_opposition | purge]] [00:03:16].

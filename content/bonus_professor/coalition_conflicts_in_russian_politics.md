The recent changes within the Russian government, specifically the appointment of Mikhail Mishustin as Prime Minister, are identified as the outcome of an intense and sharp [[struggle_among_russian_elite_coalitions | struggle among Russian elite coalitions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. This period of heightened [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_Russia | political crisis and instability]] was predicted, with analytical descriptions and predictions proving accurate by 85-90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

## Key Players and Coalitions

The [[russian_internal_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | internal Russian political dynamics]] are primarily shaped by two main, opposing coalitions:
*   **The Chemezov Coalition** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>
*   **The Patrushev Coalition** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>

These two coalitions, along with other elite groups, determine the main content of [[internal_russian_political_dynamics_and_changes | domestic Russian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

## Evolution of the Government Formation Process

The notion that Mishustin's appointment was predetermined is strongly refuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. The process was dynamic and fraught with internal conflict:

### Initial Plans and Patrushev's Candidacy
From late November to mid-February, it was believed that an agreement had been reached among key leaders for Dmitry Patrushev to become Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This plan also involved a radical renewal of the government by 75-80% and positioned Dmitry Patrushev as the heir to the individual currently acting as "President Putin" (described as a double) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

### Resistance and Stalemate
By mid-February, the Patrushev coalition's plans encountered strong and seemingly insurmountable resistance from the Chemezov coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. The Chemezov coalition categorically opposed Dmitry Patrushev becoming Prime Minister and eventually President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. This led to a "stalemate" where each group blocked the other's preferred candidate:
*   **Patrushev Coalition's candidate:** Dmitry Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>
*   **Chemezov Coalition's candidate:** Denis Manturov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>

### Compromise Candidates
Several compromise options emerged during this period:
*   **Anton Vaina:** Head of the Presidential Administration, who refused the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
*   **A security official:** Mentioned as a second compromise candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.
*   **Alexey Dyumin:** Appeared as a third candidate in the final days of April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

## China's Decisive Influence

A crucial factor that broke the stalemate was China's advocacy for Mishustin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. China insisted on Mishustin becoming Prime Minister because he personally appealed to Xi Jinping and promised to fulfill all obligations towards China assumed by the "late President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>.

China's condition for Mishustin's appointment was its agreement to a visit by the "so-called president" (the double of the late President Putin) to Beijing in mid-May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. This external influence caused "very strong irritation" among the Russian elite, who understand Russia's critical military and economic dependence on China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

## The "Rotten Compromise" and its Implications

The current state of the Russian government is the result of a "rotten compromise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>, which is not considered long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:15:00">[21:15:00]</a>.

### Key Aspects of the Compromise:
*   **Mishustin's Appointment:** Both coalitions had to accept Mishustin's candidacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.
*   **Vice-Premiers:** Denis Manturov became First Vice-Premier, and Dmitry Patrushev became a Vice-Premier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>. While Manturov's position improved in the socio-economic part of the government, Dmitry Patrushev's worsened somewhat but not fundamentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.
*   **Nikolai Patrushev's Role:** Nikolai Patrushev was promised that Dmitry Patrushev would become the new Prime Minister by the end of this year, and then president by early next year, shifting the timeline for his transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. He also maintained control over the security forces by going "into the shadows" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. His personal influence is deemed more important than any official position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.
*   **Shoigu's Removal:** It was assumed that Sergei Shoigu, the Minister of Defense, would be detained soon after his deputy, Ivanov, was arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. While the speaker did not know who would replace Shoigu, his removal and the purge of his deputies were highly probable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>. Belousov was appointed as Minister of Defense instead of Shoigu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:15:00">[16:15:00]</a>. Sergei Shoigu's position as Secretary of the Security Council is described as an "absolute void," with real affairs handled by the first deputy, Nurgaliev, who maintains control over the Armed Forces for Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a>.

## Continued Tension and Future Outlook

The current balance between the two coalitions is unstable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. The [[struggle_among_russian_elite_coali | struggle among Russian elite coalitions]] is intensifying, and the current compromise is fragile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>. This internal tension is expected to be "discharged in the most direct and immediate form," with blood being shed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>.

The "rotten compromise" suggests a temporary truce, with expectations of further shifts in power, including the potential "exit of mercenaries from power" within 6-8 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>. The [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_consolidation | real dynamics of power]] in Russia are less about official hierarchy and institutions and more about the "real weight of the political world of certain individuals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.

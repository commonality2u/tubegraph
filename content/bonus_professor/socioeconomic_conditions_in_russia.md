The "life of the Russian people" is a key topic of discussion when examining the current [[political_and_economic_conditions_in_russia | political and economic conditions in Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Recent sociological data highlights a complex and at times contradictory public mood regarding [[economic_conditions_in_russia | economic conditions]] and the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

## Public Sentiment and Information Sources

A sociological survey indicated a high and growing level of optimism within Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. However, this is tempered by several factors:
*   **Socially Approved Answers** People may not tell sociologists the truth, providing "socially approved answers" that align with perceived expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Schizophrenia of Consciousness** There is a "torn consciousness" prevalent among the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Fresh sociology from a public opinion fund showed that the anxious mood of Russians grew from 49% to 56% in a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This rise in anxiety seems to contradict the optimistic outlook on the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   **Information Sources** Optimists and pessimists in Russia are divided by their primary sources of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. For optimists, television is a key source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Viewing television creates an impression of living in a "rich, prosperous Russia" that overcomes difficulties and moves confidently forward towards victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>. This media narrative, however, also pumps up psychosis by portraying enemies everywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

### Shifting Trust in Media

A survey commissioned by Otkritie Bank for World Television Day (an autumn survey, specifically October) revealed a shift in public trust:
*   Internet media: 48% trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>
*   Social networks and Telegram channels: 45% trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>
*   Television: 36% trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>
*   Radio/Print media: 8% trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>

This dynamic is notable compared to August data from the Levada Center, which placed television at 51% trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. The discrepancy can be attributed to:
1.  **Audience Demographics**: The bank's poll focused on cities with populations over 100,000, where the urban audience is more influenced by Internet media and social networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
2.  **Recent Events**: The period between the August and autumn polls saw the successful counteroffensive of the Ukrainian armed forces and partial mobilization, leading to an increased level of fear and anxiety within Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.

Despite this shift, the agenda for online discussions is often still shaped by television and state-controlled news aggregators like Yandex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

A concerning signal for Russian propaganda is that "publicly wigs talk shows" were named the most disliked television programs by 54% of respondents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. This suggests that people are growing "sick of this propaganda," which could lead to disgust and even hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

## Household Spending and Quality of Life

A significant indicator of the [[social_and_economic_issues_in_modern_russia | social and economic issues in modern Russia]] is household spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. According to research holding Ramir, expenses on food and everyday goods for the average Russian household reached almost 48% of their budget in October, a 6.5% increase from a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This is considered a record high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

This means that nearly half of the average Russian family's income is spent merely on existing and surviving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. Consequently, much less income remains for entertainment, paid medical treatment, or personal investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. A significant portion of the population works "only to eat" and "pay off a mortgage" to have a roof over their heads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>. This situation is likened to a "slave state," where people work only to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

Food expenses alone have recently grown by 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. This presents a stark choice for many Russians: "Live as a slave and die for the Russian president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. This guiding motive, although not explicitly stated, appears to be what society is encouraged to embrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. This "monstrous" state can be difficult for many to comprehend or admit, as it involves a "devaluation of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

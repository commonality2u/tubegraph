The discussion delves into the intertwining of occult practices and political decisions within Russia, particularly focusing on the forced psychiatric treatment of Shaman Alexander Gabyshev and the wider embrace of mystical rituals by the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## The Case of Shaman Alexander Gabyshev

Shaman Alexander Gabyshev was forcibly sent to a psychiatric hospital by court order for compulsory psychiatric care and medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This decision, seemingly beyond standard [[cultural_and_societal_repression_within_russia | political repressions]], is believed by some to be motivated by perceived magical threats posed by Gabyshev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The objective is to isolate him and control any dangers associated with his "magical properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

[[shamanic_rituals_related_to_the_kremlin | The Shamanic Rituals]] of Gabyshev are rooted in Siberian-Mongolian cultural mythology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. He announced performing a "ritual to drive out evil spirits from the Kremlin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This declaration, made public, immediately led to his forced psychiatric treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. From a traditional shamanic perspective, Gabyshev's "stolen soul" ritual requires the direct participation of the person whose soul is being retrieved, which Vladimir Putin does not provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. The ritual cannot be performed remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

[[criticism_and_societal_perceptions_of_occultism_in_russia | Criticism of his Forced Psychiatric Treatment]] stems from the lack of evidence that Gabyshev poses a danger to himself or society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. He did not storm populated areas, take hostages, or threaten violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:17:08]</a>. Furthermore, there is no indication of self-harm or suicidal tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:47]</a>. His actions are seen as those of an "ordinary person who has his own ordinary worldview life, a different position," akin to Don Quixote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:18:05]</a>. The use of psychiatry for punitive purposes is condemned as creating "even greater evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:16:05]</a>.

## [[influence_of_occultism_in_russian_politics | Occultism in Russian Politics]]

The fascination with occult matters within the Russian elite is deep-seated and has historical parallels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:09]</a>.

### Historical Context and Evolution

Historically, the Russian imperial court in the early 20th century showed interest in figures like Rasputin, who was not just a healer but also wielded significant political influence by appointing ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:59]</a>. This interest resurfaced among the Chekists (Soviet security officers) from the 1920s, who were "looking for the ring of omnipotence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:26]</a>. They conducted experiments involving parapsychologists and psychics, with some of their methods still in use today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:27:06]</a>.

While initially, the interest was in looking into the future (predictions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:05]</a>, a significant shift occurred around 2014, when intensive attempts began to *influence* and *change* the future in a desired direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:19]</a>. This marks a move from passive foresight to active manipulation.

### Modern Practices and Beliefs

The current scale of [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | occult and magical practices]] in Russia's upper echelons is considered unprecedented in the country's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:08]</a>. This phenomenon is attributed to the extreme mental instability within the ruling elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:24]</a>. Many officials, having attained power through "artificial sublimation," feel a sense of horror at their unearned positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:23:02]</a>. This leads to a psychological need for rationalization, where they seek confirmation of their "chosenness" by higher powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:32]</a>. They then seek "operators" or intermediaries to communicate with these powers and solve complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:47]</a>.

Examples of [[putins_occult_interests_and_practices | mystical beliefs among Russian elite]] include:

*   **Nooscope**: A "quasi-rational attempt to explain the existence of some magical abilities," essentially a crystal ball for looking into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **"Flights to Nibiru" and "Flights to Sirius"**: These practices involve the use of naturally occurring alkaloids (such as atropine, psilocybin, and mushrooms) grown in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:37]</a>. Participants enter a circle (for Nibiru) or a triangle (for Sirius) and experience hallucinatory "flights" led by a "conductor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:32:18]</a>. These experiences are believed to provide answers and satisfaction, but they artificially increase serotonin levels, leading to distorted thought processes and potentially schizophrenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:33:18]</a>. These practices are highly addictive, leading to degradation, and influence major political and financial decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:35:26]</a>. Public media outlets like Ren TV reportedly popularize these concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:36:02]</a>.
*   **Acquisition of Grimoires**: There is active purchasing of original antique grimoires (books of spells) from Europe, as the originals are believed to possess "special power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:38:02]</a>.

### Darker Rituals and Occult Warfare

The elite's engagement with occultism has escalated to "more gloomy, more sinister, and frightening" practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:22]</a>. There's a belief that they have entered an "occult war" against powerful external entities or "orders," perceiving unexplained events as having non-rational, mystical explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:41">[00:40:31]</a>.

These rituals often involve sacrifices, though not necessarily human ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:34]</a>. Animal sacrifices, such as black roosters or goats, are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:22]</a>. The primary goal is not prediction, but to influence the future, gain invulnerability, and preserve power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:56]</a>. These practices are conducted in secret by a very narrow circle of "initiates" or "operators" for colossal sums of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:13]</a>.

Two specific "down-to-earth" and theatrical practices are particularly relevant in Moscow:

*   **Water Cult (Voodoo)**: This practice, originating from Bantu people and transformed in the Caribbean basin and Brazil, is used for inflicting evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:48">[00:47:36]</a>. It requires a fresh corpse (preferably of a maniac killer or suicide) and a "Chicherina" doll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:54]</a>. The ritual involves:
    1.  Digging up a fresh corpse, bringing it to a room, and cutting it into pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:17]</a>.
    2.  Placing corpse parts in a barrel with grave soil, inserting copies (possibly dolls), and planting live birds that die in agony to "cleanse" the soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:17">[00:48:46]</a>.
    3.  Creating a wooden doll, carved to resemble the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:49:21]</a>.
    4.  Soaking the doll in a composition of human blood and plant juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:42]</a>.
    5.  Burying the doll in the grave soil with corpse pieces for six days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:54]</a>.
    6.  Feeding the doll with "the blood of a virgin and the sperm of men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:57">[00:50:09]</a>.
    7.  Driving iron objects into the doll during a ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:29]</a>.
    One doll remains with the adepts, while a second is sent to the intended victim, relying on the psychological impact of belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:56]</a>.
*   **Santa Muerte Cult**: Originating in Mexico, this cult gives preference to mummified, rotted corpses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:52:09]</a>. These are washed, rubbed with incense, adorned with gold crowns and jewelry, and used in rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:30]</a>. Wealthy followers often possess an ancient human skull, ideally from an influential, high-ranking individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:59]</a>.

## The Church's Role

The traditional Russian Orthodox Church faces an internal crisis and political problems, making its stance on these [[occult_practices_in_russian_politics | occult practices]] complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:44]</a>. Three strategies are observed: avoidance and condemnation, calm treatment, or direct participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:24]</a>. Some within the church reportedly participate, viewing it as a "real path to power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:39]</a>. The elite's search for a "powerful force" has increasingly moved away from Orthodoxy in the last 5-6 decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:52]</a>. The Russian Orthodox Church's historical supervision by the KGB also impacts public faith and its ability to act against these trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:55]</a>.

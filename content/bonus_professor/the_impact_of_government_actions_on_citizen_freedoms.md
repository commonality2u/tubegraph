From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

In Russia, government actions and proposed legislation are increasingly impacting various aspects of citizen freedoms, particularly in the context of ongoing [[social_and_political_implications_of_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] efforts and broader political changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>. Concerns are rising regarding financial controls, travel restrictions, and the overall [[impact_of_the_current_situation_on_russian_civil_rights | human and civil rights]] within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Mobilization-Related Restrictions

The anticipated second phase of partial [[financial_and_societal_impacts_of_mobilization | mobilization]] has led to widespread questions about potential restrictions on citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

### Financial Control and Bank Accounts
One of the most frequently asked questions concerns the potential blocking of bank accounts and cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. While [[impact_of_new_laws_in_Russia | amendments to the law]] on the unified register of military personnel do not explicitly include this restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>, it is seen as the "easiest and most effective way" to compel people to report to military enlistment offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. The banking system, including the Central Bank, has reportedly been preparing for such a scenario since September of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. This measure is considered a powerful tool not explicitly added to the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

Concerns include:
*   Blocking of salary cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.
*   Impact on families with no savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.
*   The expectation that accounts would be unblocked upon reporting to the military enlistment office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

Citizens are advised to try and stock up on cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

### Other Legal Restrictions
Existing [[impact_of_new_laws_in_Russia | amendments to the law]] already include other types of restrictions aimed at compelling compliance with military summonses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>:
*   A ban on traveling to the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
*   A ban on real estate transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   A ban on registering as an individual entrepreneur (and potentially general entrepreneurial activities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   A ban on driving a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

It is noted that for many citizens who do not possess foreign passports, cars, or individual entrepreneur status, these restrictions may not be effective in compelling them to comply with mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

### Enforcement and Lack of Criminal Punishment
During the initial "partial [[social_and_national_implications_of_mobilization | mobilization]]", no person was administratively or criminally punished for evading mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. It is currently unlikely that criminal liability for evasion will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. Instead of hunting down everyone, authorities will likely set "traps" in busy public places like train stations, metro stations, and supermarkets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

### Pressure on Conscripts and Students
There is an expectation that conscripts will be pressured to sign contracts for military service, potentially immediately upon being called up, as changes to the law allow for this sooner than the previous three-month waiting period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. Conscripts are advised not to sign anything and to contact lawyers for assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

Students, particularly graduates completing their bachelor's or master's degrees, are identified as a risk group, as their deferments may be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. They are advised to seek master's programs or enterprises that can provide a reservation to avoid conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.

### Travel Risks
Reservists are advised to be cautious when traveling by plane and train in Russia, as airports and train stations are locations where checks for those who could be called up may occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. Those who have received a summons are particularly at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.

## Broader Governmental Control Measures

Beyond mobilization, broader measures indicate an increasing trend toward state control over citizens' lives.

### Financial and Digital Surveillance
A proposed bill by State Duma deputy Anatoly Wasserman, suggesting that all cash holdings over one million rubles be declared to tax authorities with an explanation of origin, highlights the authorities' intention for tighter [[governments_influence_on_internet_platforms | digital control over individuals]] and finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>. This is seen as an attempt to limit freedoms and expressions, leading to the concept of an "Electronic Gulag" no longer seeming like a metaphor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>.

### Martial Law and Movement Restrictions
The imposition of martial law, should it occur, could include a ban on the movement of Russians between regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. While not imminent, this is a possibility within the framework of martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>.

### Propaganda's Influence
State propaganda is described as influencing people through its "massiveness" and by depriving individuals of alternative information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>. This creates an "effect of a spiral of silence," where people voluntarily or involuntarily succumb to the prevailing narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>.

## Political Climate and Rights

The overall [[the_political_climate_in_russia_and_government_policies | political climate]] indicates a tightening of control and a disregard for fundamental rights.

### Tightening Repression
Repression is expected to intensify, with changes occurring rapidly, within months rather than years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:00">[25:56:00]</a>. Citizens are advised to be afraid but to maintain common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:16:00">[26:16:00]</a>.

### Justice and Human Rights
Russian society is described as currently being based on "total injustice" and the "total trampling of [[impact_of_the_current_situation_on_russian_civil_rights | human and civil rights]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:19:00">[32:19:00]</a>. The goal is to make the country and society "incomparably more just," which will require "serious changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:36:00">[32:36:00]</a>.

### Citizen Action and Risks
Advice on political action is "contextual" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:41:00">[28:41:00]</a>. When risks are "relatively small" and a "favorable situation" exists, action is encouraged (e.g., voting in elections or against constitutional referendums, participating in early 2021 protests) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:22:00">[29:22:00]</a>. However, when risks are "colossally high" or people are unable to act, direct calls for action are deemed "very dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:26:00">[29:26:00]</a>. In such times, actions like reposts or financial support for freedom and justice initiatives are suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:50:00">[29:50:00]</a>.

### Russian Passivity
The "passivity" of the Russian people is seen as both a disadvantage and, in some contexts, an advantage, likening them to "plasticine" that can be molded for good or bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>. This passivity could potentially make it easier for a future "sensible government" to negotiate with and influence society in the public interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:21:00">[31:21:00]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Potential Reforms

Despite the current challenges, there is a belief that there is "light at the end of the tunnel" and a "favorable way out" for Russia and its society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.

### Stability of the Russian Federation
It is believed that the Russian Federation will not "fall apart" even if it experiences a defeat in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>. While "serious problems" are anticipated, particularly in the North Caucasus and Volga regions, the potential for preserving Russia's unity is considered much higher than separatist potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:51:00">[18:51:00]</a>.

### Potential Government Reforms
Should the situation in the country change for the better, [[potential_government_reforms_and_policies_in_russia | reforms]] would be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:21:00">[35:21:00]</a>.
*   **Security Forces**: Some personnel would be retired, others subject to lustration, and many would remain to serve in reformed structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>. These structures would be "most decisively reformed," though not all at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:43:00">[35:43:00]</a>.
*   **Judiciary**: The court system is singled out as needing reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:50:00">[35:50:00]</a>.
*   **Timeline**: Comprehensive reforms, particularly of structures developed over 20 years, would take "several years" but are considered solvable problems, with existing plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:04:00">[36:04:00]</a>. Political will is cited as the main factor for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:19:00">[36:19:00]</a>.

The current [[impact_of_political_changes_on_daily_life | political climate]] is described as a "decisive time," offering a chance to "decisively change the historical trajectory" of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:13:00">[38:13:00]</a>.

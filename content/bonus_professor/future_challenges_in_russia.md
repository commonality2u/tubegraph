An emergency program edition on February 16, following the news of Alexei Navalny's death, highlighted significant [[future_political_and_social_changes_in_russia | future political and social challenges]] facing Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Alexei Navalny's Death and Political Implications

The speaker expressed condolences to Alexei Navalny's family, friends, and sympathizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, noting his "amazing quality" of commitment to his goals as a politician <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The speaker is inclined to believe Navalny's death was a political murder rather than a natural one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, stating that only an international etiologic investigation would convince them otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Even if it were natural, the speaker asserts that the Kremlin had been creating "impossible conditions" for years to "freeze" Navalny, leading to a critical impact on his health and psyche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Indirect signs supporting the "political murder" theory include:
*   A "very quick, unanimous reaction" from Russian official media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   An "unusually quickly" reaction from Peskov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   At least "two or three assassination attempts" on significant opponents of the elite group vying for full power in Russia over the past month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Anticipated Disinformation and Kremlin Motives

The speaker anticipates "cynical lies and real nonsense" about the circumstances of Navalny's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, suggesting that official narratives might claim he is still alive abroad, or that the West "sacrificed him" to compromise presidential elections or obscure Putin's interview with Tucker Carlson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This strategy, termed "blurring" in PR jargon, aims to distract from the core essence of events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

The common argument that Navalny's death was "unprofitable for the Kremlin" is refuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The speaker argues that the death was, in fact, "profitable, logical, and consistent" for the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The primary motivation is to "remove any risks, remove any threats" ahead of the "so-called presidential elections" and, critically, "on the eve of the transfer of power" to an elite group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. The goal is to "get rid of the slightest risks," "squeeze out all the grass," and "cement all the fields where this grass may appear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

For the Kremlin to refute these claims, the speaker suggests they should:
*   Invite international and Western experts, specifically German ones, to conduct a public international examination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   Give Navalny's body to his family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Looming Difficulties and a Call for Resilience

The speaker emphasizes that 2024 will not just be dramatic, but "most likely will turn out to be tragic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. It is predicted to be "much harder" than the year the pandemic began or the year of the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. It could be "the hardest year in our entire life," with "extremely high" chances of this occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. These predictions contribute to the overall [[economic_and_political_challenges_in_russia | economic and political challenges in Russia]] and the broader [[future_challenges_and_hopes_for_russia_in_2023 | future challenges and hopes for Russia]].

In light of these [[future_political_changes_and_developments_in_russia | future political changes and developments in Russia]], the speaker advises:
*   Taking care of one's health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   Helping family and friends, as they are the "key to our stability and the key and conditions for our survival" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   Loving each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

Despite the "tragic day and very heavy words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, the speaker conveys "a piece... of that confidence of that hope" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, firmly believing that "everything will change for the better and will begin to change already in this 2024" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, concluding with the conviction that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

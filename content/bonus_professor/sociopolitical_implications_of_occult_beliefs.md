The influence of occult beliefs and practices within the highest echelons of Russian power has become a subject of public discussion, suggesting a shift from traditional religious adherence to a reliance on perceived magical solutions for political and personal challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This phenomenon is argued to reflect deep-seated instabilities and a search for "rings of omnipotence" by ruling elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

## The Case of Shaman Alexander Gabyshev

The forced psychiatric treatment of Alexander Gabyshev, a self-proclaimed shaman from Yakutsk, highlights the intersection of political repression and occult concerns within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Gabyshev was forcibly sent to a psychiatric hospital by court decision, where he would undergo medical treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Political analyst Valery Solovyov suggests that the root cause of Gabyshev's isolation was not merely political, but "magical" or occult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. He claims there was a direct order from the Russian President to "stab the shaman with drugs" and render him into a "state of vegetables," or force him to cease "socially significant initiatives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This action followed Gabyshev's announcement that he had conducted a ritual to "drive out evil spirits" from the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

The "stolen soul" ritual, inherent to the Siberian-Mongolian cultural group, involves a shaman journeying to the lower world to retrieve a soul stolen by a demon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. A key requirement is that the person whose soul was stolen *must* participate in the ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, making a remote ritual for someone like Putin impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. This type of shamanic activity is considered by some experts to be a "naive children's fairy tale" compared to more "sinister and bloody cults" or the activities of "13 world occult orders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

Psychiatrist Natalia Bekhtereva stated that the use of psychiatry for punitive purposes "gives rise to even greater evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Gabyshev's alleged "danger to society" or himself has no clear evidence base, as he neither stormed populated areas, took hostages, threatened people, nor destroyed infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

## Historical and Contemporary Perspectives on Occultism in Russia

[[Historical context of occultism in Russia | Interest in occult matters]] within Russian leadership began around 2000, fueled by predictions from certain individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This interest intensified around 2014, shifting from merely looking into the future to actively attempting to influence and change it in a "right direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

Russian rulers, particularly the Chekists (security services) since the 1920s, have been described as searching for a "ring of omnipotence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## [[Historical context of occultism in Russia | Historical and Contemporary Perspectives on Black Magic]]

[[Historical context of occultism in Russia | Interest in occult matters]] within Russian leadership began around 2000, fueled by predictions from certain individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This interest intensified around 2014, shifting from merely looking into the future to actively attempting to influence and change it in a "right direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### The Search for Power and the Ring of Omnipotence
Russian rulers, particularly the Chekists (security services) since the 1920s, have been described as searching for a "ring of omnipotence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This search initially traversed the paths of Orthodoxy, but this was seen as insufficient for the needs of the elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Consequently, by the early 2010s, they increasingly turned to other practices, including Eastern esotericism and eventually more sinister forms of [[occultism and magical practices in Russia | occultism and magical practices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Current Context
> The current situation among the Russian ruling elite suggests extreme mental instability and a search for rationalization, leading them to believe they are "chosen by higher powers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:07">[00:23:07]</a>. They seek intermediaries to guide them and solve complex problems, and these beliefs seriously influence decision-making processes in political, financial, and managerial spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

### Occult Practices and Rituals
The "ring of omnipotence" was also sought by Soviet security officers, who utilized parapsychologists and psychics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. The interest extended to "time management" problems and a broad spectrum of esoteric and occult subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. This indicates a fundamental disbelief in their own inherent power, leading them to seek external forces through blood rituals and other practices to secure their power and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

Among the current practices, two "so-called practices" are highly relevant in Moscow:
*   **"Water" (Voodoo)**: This practice, particularly its "toughest, bloodiest" direction, involves the use of a fresh corpse (preferably a maniac killer or suicide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>. Rituals involve cutting the corpse, mixing its parts with grave soil, and placing live birds on copies, which must die in "terrible agony" to cleanse the soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>. A key element is a wooden doll, carved to resemble the "victim," soaked in a composition of human blood and plant juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:49">[00:48:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>. This doll is then buried in the grave soil and later fed with the blood of a virgin and the sperm of men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. Finally, iron objects are "killed" into the doll <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>. One doll remains with the adepts, while another is sent to the intended person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>. The psychological impact on a person who believes in this is considered the primary effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

*   **Santa Muerte**: This cult, originating in Mexico, utilizes mummified remains, preferably those that have "completely rotted in the ground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. Rituals involve washing, anointing with incense, and adorning the mummy with a golden crown and precious jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:16">[00:52:16]</a>. Followers consider it "simply necessary to have a human skull at home," specifically from an influential person of high rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>.

Other practices include "flights to Nibiru" and "flights to Sirius," which involve the use of naturally growing alkaloids (such as atropine, psilocybin, and mushrooms) within specific ritualistic shapes (circles for Nibiru, triangles for Sirius) to induce hallucinations and a sense of "flight" and "communication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:30">[00:31:30]</a>. These practices can lead to addiction and "rapid personal transformation of degradation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>. The public is exposed to similar concepts through channels like Ren TV, which popularizes flat earth theories, reptilians, and Nibiru <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.

There is also a strong interest in collecting antique grimoires from Europe, specifically the original texts, as they are believed to possess a "special property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>. These practices are part of a "colossal business," involving "solid operators for solid gentlemen" who perform rituals for "colossal money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>. Sacrifices, often involving black roosters or goats, are common requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:22">[00:39:22]</a>.

### [[Occult rites and political synchronization in Russia | Occult War and Elites]]
Those deeply involved in these practices have a feeling that they have "entered into an occult war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:43">[00:39:43]</a>, specifically a conflict with "two or three very powerful" organizations or "13 world occult orders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. Unexplained events are interpreted through an occult lens, rather than as mere coincidences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. This belief is apparently shared by "that side" as well, with rumors from Europe suggesting a similar perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. As a result, the elites resort to increasingly potent means and rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>. The nature and depth of these practices far exceed anything seen in Imperial Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:55">[00:42:55]</a>.

The [[influence of occultism on political figures | influence of occultism on political figures]] and business elites is profound. They often interact within a "very closed," "definitely tested" environment of practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. Their "level of culture" and "level of formation" are cited as indicators for susceptibility to these beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

## [[Interplay of religion and occult practices | Interplay of Religion and Occult Practices]]

The traditional church, particularly Russian Orthodoxy, faces challenges in responding to this surge in occult practices among the elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.

There are three main strategies observed in the church's response to non-traditional occult practices:
1.  **Avoidance/Condemnation**: Denying and condemning these practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:08]</a>.
2.  **Calm Treatment**: Approaching them with equanimity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>.
3.  **Participation**: Some individuals within the church even participate, believing it to be a "real path to power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>.

The Russian elite is perceived to be seeking a "more powerful master" or a "force capable of helping her," and they are increasingly finding this force outside of Orthodoxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:16">[00:56:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:29">[00:56:29]</a>. While a decade ago, there was an attempt to return to Orthodox roots, the past five to six years have shown a clear departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>.

Skepticism towards traditional religious rites is widespread, particularly due to the historical oversight of the Russian Orthodox Church by the State Security Committee (KGB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:31">[00:58:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>. This has led to a situation where [[occult practices in Russian politics | occultism and magical practices]] are gaining more prominence, influencing the behavior of the highest elite circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:57">[00:59:57]</a>.

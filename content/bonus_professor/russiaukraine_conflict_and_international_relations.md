## Overview of the Conflict and Peace Prospects

Russian authorities are reportedly receiving signals from various sources indicating that it is time to end the war with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The "Kremlin towers" (referring to different factions within the Kremlin) desire to conclude military actions against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. However, the "power" or "Chekist" tower seeks to end the [[ukraine_russia_conflict | conflict]] on more aggressive terms than those proposed by the "pragmatist and realist" tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

Plans for a truce or peace agreement with Ukraine remain in effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The timelines for implementing these plans are subject to change due to unforeseen circumstances, such as the escalation of [[russian_military_operations_and_international_relations | military actions]] that began in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. A group with "carte blanche" until December 15 is expected to request an extension until at least January 20, coinciding with the potential inauguration of President Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

The American side, including a potential new administration, is sending both private and public signals to Russia, indicating that delays in reaching a truce will not be tolerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The US is prepared to use blackmail if necessary to compel Russia to conclude a truce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Historical Context of Military Action

It was reported with "absolute certainty" that a decision on [[russian_military_operations_and_international_relations | military action]] by Russia against Ukraine was made at the end of 2021 and would be implemented around February-March 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### Prevention of Escalation and Nuclear Weapons Use

The Chemezov group has been instrumental in preventing a new wave of mobilization and the use of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. While the possibility of discussing nuclear weapons as a realistic and acceptable option arose, this group did not allow many "extremely dangerous things" to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

At the turn of March-April 2022, the issue of using tactical nuclear weapons began to move into the practical sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Several individuals, at the cost of their careers, blocked this possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

## International Relations and Diplomacy

### US-Kremlin Deal Allegations

A version suggesting a deal between the USA and the Kremlin, where Putin metastasizes in Syria in exchange for receiving all conquests in Ukraine, is described as "100% wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.

### Russia-Ukraine Relations: A Missed Opportunity

There was a significant chance for Russia and Ukraine to foster more friendly and good-neighborly relations, which would have benefited both countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>. This opportunity largely depended on Russia, or more precisely, a part of the Russian leadership (the Kremlin), which chose not to utilize this chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>.

### Mariupol's Fate

The future of Mariupol is now primarily dependent on the plans of the elected President Trump, as the Russian elite and the Kremlin will have to adhere to these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

### Cryptocurrency and Sanctions

The Russian authorities are not preparing to arrest or confiscate cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:48:07]</a>. This is because the Russian authorities themselves extensively use cryptocurrency as one of the few remaining tools to circumvent sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>. All crypto exchanges are reportedly under the auspices and control of the FSB, with all transactions recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>. Transactions exceeding $20 attract interest, but smaller individual amounts (tens of thousands of dollars) are not of particular interest compared to larger transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:43">[00:48:43]</a>.

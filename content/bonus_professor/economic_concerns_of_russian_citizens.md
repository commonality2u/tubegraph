The primary concerns of Russian society in March 2023 were significantly economic, according to a poll from the Levada Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This data highlights the [[russian_societal_concerns_and_priorities | priorities]] of citizens, focusing on domestic [[economic_challenges_in_russia | economic challenges]] over external conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

## Key Concerns

The most significant worry for Russians was rising prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Rising Prices:** 58% of respondents reported being concerned about rising prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Military Confrontation:** The armed confrontation in Ukraine, the conflict with the West, and sanctions were a concern for 33% of respondents, placing it second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. The gap between economic concerns and military-political concerns was described as "colossal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Human Rights:** Concerns regarding the restriction of civil rights, democratic freedoms, freedom of speech, and freedom of the press were only reported by 4% of Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>, putting it in last place on the list of worries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This 4% figure is noted to approximate the audience of some pro-liberal media broadcasting to a Russian audience from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

## Financial Hardship

Further demonstrating the [[economic_and_social_consequences_in_russia | social and economic challenges]], a separate poll on the [[social_and_economic_challenges_faced_by_russian_society | economic and social situation]] of citizens revealed significant financial hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>:
*   **Food and Clothing:** One in six Russian citizens (approximately 16.7%) reported not having enough money for food and clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Food Alone:** 4% of people stated they did not even have enough money for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   **Clothing Only:** 13% had enough money for food but not for clothes or shoes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

## Demographic Impact

The demographic group experiencing the worst [[economic_challenges_faced_by_russian_households | financial situation]] also showed the highest support for the Russian president and his policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
*   **Pensioners:** 27% of respondents over the age of 60, predominantly pensioners, complained they did not have enough money for food or clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. Despite "glaring reality" and "empty refrigerators," this group forms a key base of support for the president's policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. This support is attributed to the fact that they are not threatened by mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

## Anticipated Mobilization Impact

In anticipation of potential general mobilization, citizens were advised to prepare for immediate financial consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   **Bank Account Blocking:** It is expected that once a digital summons is sent, bank cards and accounts of those subject to mobilization will be blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Financial Preparation:** Citizens were urged to save money in advance, ideally before May 1, as this date is indicated by instructions for defense enterprises to prepare for employee reservations within two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This preparation suggests a practical phase for mobilization may begin after the May holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

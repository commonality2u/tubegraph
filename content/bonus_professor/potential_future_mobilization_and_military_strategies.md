Valery Solovey addressed questions regarding potential future military actions, mobilization, and related strategies. The discussions covered various aspects, including the current state of military affairs, future policies, and the challenges faced by the Russian system.

## Military Mobilization Discussions
The question of [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] is currently being debated, with military personnel insisting on its necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This discussion tends to ebb and flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. A decision regarding [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] is not expected before August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

### Hybrid Operations and Mobilization
A "hybrid operation" does not require a large military contingent, particularly in its initial phases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Therefore, [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] and a hybrid operation can be carried out simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The hybrid operation also serves as a form of psychological and moral pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. The current hybrid war seeks to divert Western influence and keep Western nations preoccupied with their own issues, rather than assisting Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.

## Issues with Military Service
There has been an increase in cases where young people unfit for [[military_service_and_mobilization_strategies | military service]], such as those with asthma or schizophrenia, are being illegally conscripted into the army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. This is likely due to a general, possibly oral, instruction to conscript anyone who does not resist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>.

### Police Departures and Risk
People are leaving the police force en masse due to the demanding and unsafe nature of the work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. A significant risk for police officers is being deployed to newly acquired territories, though not necessarily to active combat roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

## Military Leadership and Control
Military counterintelligence is considered a very effective department within the FSB of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This service prevents resistance from generals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

Sergei Viktorovich Chemezov and his coalition possess influence and power comparable to Patrushev's, potentially even stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. This coalition can influence the course of hostilities because it controls the growth of technology and is the main supplier of defense products for the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. They can also block some or many of Patrushev's decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Nuclear Weapons
The current leadership responsible for Russia's military policy is described as less "bloodthirsty" than the late Vladimir Putin, who reportedly wished to take the entire world with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. These individuals are more realistic and comprehend the risks associated with using tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. Although they may issue rhetorical threats, the calm reaction from Americans indicates a pre-existing oral agreement that nuclear weapons will not be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.

## Intelligence Operations
Russia possesses an extensive spy network, primarily managed by Russian military intelligence, which often operates under false flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. A part of the current hybrid operation involves destabilizing the situation in European countries, particularly those actively supporting Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.

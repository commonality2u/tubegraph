From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

This article summarizes answers to questions posed by viewers, featured in the sixth episode of the "Answers to Hot Questions" program, broadcast on Thursday, June 27, at 1 PM Moscow time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The program addresses popular, relevant, interesting, and sometimes curious questions left under the host's Monday video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Current Political and Social Issues

### Putin's Role and Status
There is a belief that Evgeny Vasilyevich, who plays the role of the President of Russia, is directed through micro-earphones and lacks his own will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. He is considered to be under house arrest, both factually and legally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It is expected that it will be publicly announced that a double has long been performing the president's duties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This revelation would become a world shock, though many [[western_and_ukrainian_responses | Western governments]] are already aware but find it suits their interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The individuals controlling the double instruct him on how to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>. Most politicians are either afraid to speak about this, or it serves their interest to maintain the myth that Putin is alive to preserve the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.

### Withdrawal of Troops from Ukraine
Russian troops will be withdrawn from Ukraine once a peace agreement is signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. It is hoped that the withdrawal might begin earlier as a gesture of goodwill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

### Shamans and Predictions
Shamans who reportedly predicted Putin poorly were mistaken in their predictions, leading to severe punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This information was not reported even in opposition Telegram channels because they prefer not to believe such accounts, despite reality confirming forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Declassification of KGB/FSB Documents
If the opposition comes to power, KGB and FSB documents will be declassified, with the exception of top-secret units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The statute of limitations will be applied automatically, and archives will be opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Names of all informers who worked against Russian society will be revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This aims to ensure that such events never happen again and that evil is recognized and punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Trolling Vasilyevich (Putin)
The host is not sure if the incident where Kim gave Vasilyevich a memorial plaque was trolling, as he lacks sufficient knowledge of Korean politeness and culture to definitively judge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Political Group "Cheese"
If the "Cheese" group, including Patrushev and Manturov, comes to power, it would mean they seize power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This coalition taking power would be "much better" compared to the current situation, though it is not the ultimate goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The method by which "our team" will seize power cannot be publicly discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Changes in Law Enforcement Agencies
Serious changes are expected in all law enforcement agencies, including the Investigative Committee, in the fall of this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. These changes may involve leadership shifts, not necessarily of the main leader, but possibly his deputies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

### Legitimacy of Laws and Decrees
The establishment of a new Russian Republic, which is seen as inevitable, will sweep away the legitimacy of current laws, decrees, and agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. The old Russian Republic established in 1991-1993 was irrevocably destroyed, necessitating a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

### Monuments to "Heroes"
The team has a "very definite point of view" on what will happen to monuments to "heroes" erected around the country when they come to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### FSB and "Moles"
The FSB may attempt to look for moles, but the main challenge in investigations is not to expose oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

### Allegations of Russian Special Services Recruiting Critics
The host does not spend time speculating on whether Russian special services recruited figures like Aristovich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. He suggests that if someone already acts in a way that benefits you, there's no need to recruit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

### Participation in Mark Zakharovich's Programs
The host has been invited by Mark Zakharovich but explained why he cannot participate in programs with him, and they reached "complete mutual understanding" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

### Baimak Events Participants
Participants of the Baimak events in Bashkortostan on January 1 will be unconditionally released and rehabilitated, along with all political prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

### Environmental Control
The team plans to implement stricter pollution control, raising it to an absolute level, to ensure an ecologically clean environment and quality food for the people of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Putin's Family Assets
The host does not know the current location of the late President Putin's family assets, including tens of tons of convertible currencies, precious metals, and stones, which were reportedly taken to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. He advises asking the SVR general about this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Russian Guard
The host does not understand the purpose of the Russian Guard, created by Putin for personal use, and plans to liquidate it upon coming to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. He cannot find any practical meaning or logic in its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

### Retirement Age
The host supports equalizing the retirement age for men and women after first returning to original retirement age values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. A detailed economic and social development plan exists for Russia, including a specific scheme for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. The SVR general has more information on this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

### [[recommendations_for_financial_and_personal_preparedness_amidst_crisis | Recommendations for Crimea Residents]]
Residents of Crimea are advised to be vigilant and prepare for possible problems such as power and water outages, and potential food shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The host plans to discuss preparedness in more detail in an upcoming speech on July 18 or 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### Moral Responsibility for Conflict
It is considered unfair to allow society to move away from the topic of moral responsibility for the armed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. The true history of what happened to Russia over the last quarter-century needs to be covered and reported as part of school socialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. However, moral responsibility is an individual, not collective, category, and cannot be imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. The goal is to provide truthful historical education and open people's eyes to enable self-reflection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

### Dima Yakovlev's Law
The host has a strictly negative attitude towards Dima Yakovlev's law, stating it will certainly be repealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. Those who initiated it and harmed children in orphanages will face fair punishment according to the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.

### Second Wave of Mobilization
The chances of a second wave of mobilization are currently lower, but the possibility is not absolutely excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Progressive forces are trying to prevent it from returning to the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. The issue will likely be discussed in late summer or early autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. Key operational information regarding this is reported by General SVR's Telegram and YouTube channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

### Hybrid Operation in Baltic Countries
Specific options for implementing a hybrid operation in relation to the Baltic countries at the turn of September-October are being discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. This is considered highly important information, especially for residents of Belarus, Kaliningrad region, Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, who should prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

### Negligent Developers
Negligent developers who use low-quality materials and build faulty houses will be punished, and legislative changes will be implemented to prevent such practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. Punishment will include financial compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

### Definition of "Our Victory"
"Our victory" refers to the victory for people of goodwill, those who desire freedom and justice for Russia, and wish for their country to live in peace and prosperity without threatening anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. The main problems for Russia are internal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

### Ukraine and Unnamed Warheads
Publications on the Internet about Ukraine preparing to use unnamed warheads are "absolute nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

### "Reptilian" Officials
The reference to some Russian officials resembling "reptilians" is a joke with a grain of truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>. It refers to officials whose instincts and behavior (such as lack of compassion, focus on territory, and sexual instinct) align with those of reptiles, despite outwardly resembling humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

### Regional Development
The team plans to develop regions by creating new development centers and implementing budgetary federalism, allowing regions a larger share of regional income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>. The ultimate goal is to transform Russia into a true federation, requiring people to bear responsibility for their land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.

### Migration Policy
A new comprehensive migration policy will be introduced, beginning with the reduction of the visa regime to control migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>. Migrants will be directed to areas where they are needed, such as for enterprise construction or port modernization, rather than where it is perceived as easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>.

### Burial of Lenin and Mausoleum's Future
Lenin will be buried sooner rather than later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. The Mausoleum, considered a monument of architecture, history, and culture, will not be torn down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. It can be transformed into a museum of Russian banners, showcasing flags from imperial Russia, the Soviet era, and modern Russia, representing the quintessence of Russian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.

### Currency Denomination
Despite new banknotes, a denomination is an inevitable stage for exiting the financial and economic crisis and will definitely occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. Following previous recommendations on financial preparedness can protect against losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. Banning currency circulation is almost unbelievable, as a black market would persist and cannot be curbed, making such a ban counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.

### Public Transport and Income
While public transport and taxi costs can be regulated (e.g., through subsidies for air travel in a country as large as Russia), the primary policy focus is on significantly and constantly increasing Russian citizens' incomes to make tickets more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:03">[00:29:03]</a>.

### Accountability for War Crimes
Individuals who committed crimes during military actions will be held accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. Those who did not commit crimes will bear moral responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:09">[00:30:09]</a>. A new system of socialization will help people understand the terrible events and their personal share of responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>. Personal responsibility cannot be denied, even if collective responsibility is not imposed (to avoid totalitarianism) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.

### Cup Holder with Double-Headed Eagle
The cup holder with a double-headed eagle seen in videos is an antique gift from close family friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:41">[00:31:41]</a>. It is used because the host enjoys drinking tea from objects with history, not to send political messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:52">[00:31:52]</a>.

### Network Interruptions in Latvia
Network interruptions when leaving Riga, Latvia, are not yet a full-fledged [[western_and_ukrainian_responses | hybrid operation]], but rather a testing of the tools for such operations, including in relation to Europe as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>.

### Colonel Shendakov's Arrest
Colonel Shendakov is described as a worthy, direct, and frank person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. His directness and frankness about ongoing events in Russia led to his arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>.

### Personal Pressure and Duty
The host acknowledges being under strong pressure, with his family also experiencing constant pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. He continues because it is his duty as a human and a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.

### Downing of MH17
The downing of Boeing MH17 was a mistake, and Strelkov was not involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. Other people are responsible for this "very dark truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>.

### Unpopular Questions
The host wonders if the public would listen to answers to unpopular questions (those that don't get likes) and suggests the public should express whether he should answer them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>.

### Breaking Russia's Historical Cycle
The team believes it is possible to break Russia out of its cyclical repetition of negative historical patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. Success depends on the ruling group having an action plan and receiving public support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>. The team currently possesses the necessary components to change Russia's historical trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>.

### Rural Resettlement and Village Revival
A program for the "de-urbanization" of Russia will be launched and financed, allowing people of age to resettle in rural areas and revive villages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:49">[00:37:49]</a>. This is possible if military actions are not financed and widespread theft is curbed, freeing up significant funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>.

### Vietnam's Participation in Double-Meeting
Vietnam participated in a meeting with a Russian double due to material interest, as Russia offered beneficial projects to Vietnam (though not necessarily to Russia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. Additionally, Vietnam remembers the historical aid provided by the Soviet Union that helped them achieve national independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>.

### Future of the FSB
The FSB will undergo the "most serious transformations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>. Special services, including counterintelligence and foreign intelligence, are necessary for any state, especially one like Russia with significant interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. However, radical and profound reform is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:47">[00:39:47]</a>.

### Addressing Veterans with Mental Health Issues
The current Russian government (Politburo 2.0) is not actively addressing the problem of returning veterans with mental health issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>. The host's team has a plan to deal with this, involving registration for psychiatric care, special medications to help them reintegrate into society, and drawing on the experiences of countries that have faced similar challenges, including Russia's own past wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>.

## Program Information

### Upcoming Meeting
A new online meeting is planned for July 18 or 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:42">[00:41:42]</a>. A link for this meeting will be posted soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:03">[00:42:03]</a>.

### Supporting the Program
Viewers can support the program morally and psychologically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:19">[00:42:19]</a>. Specific help includes subscribing to recommended Telegram resources (found in the video description or pinned comment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. Financial assistance can be provided through bank details or a fast payment system via phone number (Alfa Bank) listed in the same locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:45">[00:43:45]</a>. This support is described as a form of civic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>.

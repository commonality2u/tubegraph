## Overview
As of May 1st, 2023, the [[reputation_and_international_relations_of_russia | international situation]] of the [[russian_government_changes | Russian Federation]] and its leadership is characterized by significant challenges and [[geopolitical_tensions_and_russias_international_relationships | international isolation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[13:42]</a>. While traditionally Russia reports on successes and achievements around May 1st to May 9th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[01:58]</a>, current events suggest a starkly different reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[02:10]</a>.

## Diplomatic and Political Isolation
The Russian President has found himself in [[international_isolation_of_russia | international isolation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[13:42]</a>.
*   **South Africa's Stance**: South Africa requested the Russian President not to attend a planned conference in August, instead suggesting participation via video link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[13:54]</a>.
*   **Limited Travel**: The President has reportedly decided against most international trips, with Minsk being a potential exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[14:04]</a>.
*   **China's Position**: The conversation between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky signaled a deterioration in Russia's [[geopolitical_tensions_and_russias_international_relationships | international relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[15:49]</a>. Zelensky stated that China agreed not to supply weapons to the [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[16:21]</a>. This indicates China is "comparing watches" with both Moscow and Kyiv ahead of the anticipated Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[16:26]</a>.

## Perceptions of Leadership
The discussion surrounding the Russian President's health and the use of doubles has intensified, not only in [[western_countries_stance_towards_russias_leadership | Western media]] but also within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[11:10]</a>. This public discourse contributes to the perception of instability and a lack of reliable leadership, further exacerbating [[international_isolation_of_russia | international isolation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[12:34]</a>. The belief in doubles has become a "media reality" and a "reality of public opinion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[13:06]</a>.

## Military Setbacks and Their International Impact
The [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | special military operation]] has yielded few successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[02:10]</a>.
*   **Lack of Progress**: The Russian Armed Forces have not captured key objectives like Bakhmut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[02:22]</a>, and progress in other areas is absent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[02:51]</a>.
*   **Anticipation of Ukrainian Offensive**: Russian military leaders anticipate a Ukrainian offensive, considering the prospect of fighting on Crimean territory as a serious possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[06:11]</a>. The Kerch Bridge could be targeted, potentially turning Crimea into an island, which is seen as a realistic scenario by the Russian military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[07:04]</a>.
*   **Cancellation of Public Events**: Due to security concerns related to Ukrainian drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[04:24]</a>, mass events for May 1st and May 9th have been cancelled in front-line regions and even in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[03:33]</a>. Red Square was closed, and the air part of the May 9th parade was cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[04:05]</a>.
*   **Personnel Shortages**: There is a significant shortage of personnel, leading to intensive recruitment campaigns for contract soldiers and prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[07:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[07:29]</a>. These efforts aim to recruit up to half a million contract soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[07:39]</a>.

## Internal Repression as a Response
Faced with external pressures and military challenges, the authorities' primary response has been to tighten internal repressions against those perceived as a "fifth column" or "traitors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[18:58]</a>. This policy is expected to be painful for those within Russia who express dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[19:39]</a>.

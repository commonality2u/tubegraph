From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The [[Political situation in Russia | political situation in Russia]] is currently characterized by a theoretical "transit scheme" on which a preliminary agreement was reached at the end of November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This scheme is a result of a broad compromise and agreement among a wide coalition of elite groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Key Players and Power Dynamics

Currently, Nikolai Patrushev is described as the "supreme ruler of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. However, this arrangement is temporary and a compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Elite groups are observing how Patrushev and his son, Dmitry Patrushev (potentially the next prime minister), will conduct affairs before rushing to change supreme power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. These groups know more about Nikolai Patrushev and are in no hurry to solidify his position, even planning to "replay this game" or agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Prime Minister Mishustin, despite the president's death, is described as having "practically no significant power" to initiate political systemic decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## The "Double" Phenomenon

A significant aspect of the current [[Internal political dynamics and power transition in Russia | internal political dynamics and power transition in Russia]] is the assertion that the actual president of Russia is deceased and has been replaced by a "double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This double is said to be under "complete absolute control" and will not be allowed to make independent decisions, including dismissing Nikolai Patrushev or appointing Dmitry Patrushev as Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Evidence cited for the double's existence includes:
*   A sudden, diametrically opposite change in the president's behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   Changes in appearance, including becoming younger, livelier, more cheerful, and stopping hand shaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   The double being taller and younger than the deceased president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   A change in voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   The double uses a special earpiece, a "spy VK," to avoid major mistakes, although he still makes small ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>.

The deceased president's body is reportedly still in a "Valdai refrigerator" until it can be transferred to better storage conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

### Public Perception and Evidence
The speaker acknowledges that much of the public is not satisfied with the evidence provided regarding the double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, demanding "one hundred percent evidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. However, the speaker argues that demanding such proof is a "justification for one's own inaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Information about the double has been published in major Western and non-Western countries, including respectable publications and news sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

## International Relations and Outlook

The international situation, particularly relations between Russia and Ukraine, is unlikely to improve before autumn of the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Even when [[Future political changes and developments in Russia | internal political changes]] begin in Russia, it will take time for the crisis to fully manifest and influence international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

Western and Eastern countries, such as Arab nations, Saudi Arabia, and China, prioritize their own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>. Their primary interest is maintaining stability in Russia, regardless of the regime that ensures it, even if it is "cruel and cannibalistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. They do not view it as their role to implement [[Sociopolitical changes in Russia | changes]] or fight for freedom and democracy in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. International leaders, including Xi Jinping, have met with the double, extracting their own benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

## Domestic Challenges and Future Prospects

### Economic Situation
Inflation is highly likely to get out of control next year, indicating a crisis that is "stretched out in time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:29">[00:26:29]</a>.

### Political Transition and Crisis
The speaker has repeatedly warned that Putin's death will not be a liberation, and the situation will likely worsen, becoming "much more difficult" than the COVID-19 pandemic or the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. However, his death presents a "chance" that must be seized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Clear signs of a [[Potential political changes in Russia after Putin | political crisis]] are expected within two to three months from early December, before or around the presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

### Opposition and Future Governance
The suggested slogan for the opposition is "Putin is dead" and "all this is illegitimate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. Any new ruler would be better than a "dead person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.

Regarding future governance, the speaker believes that [[Future political changes in Russia | Western-style democracy]] is both possible and necessary for the population, as no one wants to live in poverty, lawlessness, or be suppressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>. Building a "new Socialism" is deemed impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. The speaker's team aims to implement mechanisms of checks and balances—both institutional and extra-institutional—to prevent a return to a dictatorial form of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>.

### Military and Societal Outlook
A second wave of mobilization is currently uncertain, depending on the dynamics of the general and domestic [[Political situation in Russia | political situation]] and the Russian-Ukrainian confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. Russian troops' counterattacks are noted as having political goals: to demonstrate offensive potential, create a favorable background before elections, and pressure the West to cease aid to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. The possibility of martial law being introduced is also discussed, especially if the country is perceived as turning into a military camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.

### Accountability and Prisoners
The speaker believes that those who fought in Ukraine will likely face a similar outcome to the Soviet soldiers returning from Afghanistan: a feeling of being disowned ("we did not send you there") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. Military leadership, including Shoigu and Gerasimov, who are accused of violating the law and betraying the country, will be held responsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>.

[[Change in the political landscape in Russia | Changes in Russia]] are expected to free political prisoners, including Alexei Navalny, who is currently in transit to a maximum-security penal colony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. Navalny is reportedly alive and in a "more or less acceptable physical condition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Igor Strelkov (Girkin) is also considered a political prisoner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>.

Prigozhin is expected to reappear during a time of "high turbulence" after Putin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>.

### Legal Reforms
In the "new Russia," many cases, including those related to foreign currency mortgages, will likely need to be reviewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:39">[00:30:39]</a>.

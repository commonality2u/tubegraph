This article summarizes discussions on potential [[military_events_and_geopolitical_forecasts | military events and geopolitical forecasts]] and their broader [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | geopolitical implications]], including internal [[potential_political_and_military_developments_in_russia_and_ukraine | Russian political dynamics]] and their impact on regional stability.

## Program Introduction and Correction
This program is the first episode of "Answers to Hot Questions," aired on Thursday, May 9, at 1 PM Moscow time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The speaker issued a correction regarding a previous statement from May 6, clarifying that Tartu airport was not closed for a month, as initially reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The idea of closing the airport was discussed but not implemented, as threats to flight safety were "leveled in the normal mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Dynamics of Political Crisis
It is impossible to predict the full development, content, and results of a political crisis using existing theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. However, predicting the *entry* into a political crisis is possible, with an accuracy exceeding 75% and approaching that of a short-term weather forecast (85%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Active participation in a crisis from its beginning offers tangible chances to influence its desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The most acute phase, or "peak," of a crisis is expected to last only a few days, while the crisis itself will span several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Internal Power Struggles and Coalitions
Those who oppose Nikolai Platonovich Patrushev and his allies are equally influential, making opposition to them difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Power in Russia "blinds the eyes" and "breaks any rational sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The strength of Patrushev's and Chemezov's coalitions is equal, with Chemezov's coalition possibly even stronger currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### Role of State Institutions in Crisis
*   **Prosecutor General's Office and Investigative Committee:** Expected to align with the winning side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. In the acute phase, they may play no role due to a lack of armed resources, but can serve as "important instruments" for one of the coalitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA):** Expected to be subordinate to the winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. The most preferable position for them is neutrality, likened to the "fortress plan" where police stations close and do nothing, similar to the KGB's behavior in August 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Defense and General Staff:** The Ministry of Defense will likely take a position of neutrality and play no role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. However, the main department within the General Staff could play an important role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## [[military_events_and_geopolitical_forecasts | Military and Geopolitical Forecasts]]

### Situation in Ukraine
*   **Kharkov:** The Russian Federation desires to take Kharkov, but currently lacks the strength for such an operation, and it is unlikely to acquire the necessary forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. The speaker suggests that possessing Kharkov would incentivize Ukraine to negotiate on Russia's terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. The possibility of the Ukrainian front collapsing due to the "fog of war" and military action developments cannot be discounted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.
*   **Peaceful Negotiations:** Possible both before and after a coup in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
*   **War Crimes:** The speaker's political force takes a "definitely positive" stance on investigating and punishing all those guilty of crimes against humanity and war crimes after the war's conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

### Nuclear War
The possibility of a nuclear war starting is theoretically not excluded, but practically, despite rhetoric, the real possibility is "very, very small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

### Regional Outlook

#### Kaliningrad Region
The future of the Kaliningrad region depends on whether the [[potential_political_and_military_actions_involving_russia | Russian Federation starts a hybrid operation]] against the Baltic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. If an operation begins, its dynamics and NATO's reaction will determine the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

#### Crimea
"Crimea does not expect anything good" regardless of how the situation develops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

#### Siberia and the Far East
There is a hypothetical possibility of these territories falling under a Chinese protectorate, but the speaker believes this possibility will "tend to zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. The outcome will depend on the future leadership of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

#### Kremlin's Plans for Georgia and Armenia
*   **Georgia:** The Kremlin has already implemented its plans; the Georgian leadership is under "very strong influence" of the Kremlin, evident in the adoption of the law on Foreign Agents, copied from Russian law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. The Kremlin is unable to influence Georgian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.
*   **Armenia:** The Kremlin wishes to punish Armenia because Nikol Pashinyan is its head, but it is unable to do so as "all the resources are diverted to other directions, to other fronts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

## Internal Russian Affairs and Societal Impact

### Terrorist Acts
Security officers are doing everything possible to prevent future terrorist acts like the one committed by Islamic terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

### Post-Crisis Economic and Social Measures
If the speaker's team comes to power:
*   **Pensions:** Preferential pensions for police, courts, prosecutors, and the Russian Guard will be canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Those who committed crimes (beating protesters, criminal sentences) will be prosecuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. All court employees will undergo lustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Service housing may not be taken away, as lustration is considered sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. The old retirement age will be returned within 1 to 1.5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. Compensation will be provided to those who retired later under the new age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.
*   **Minimum Wage:** Plans are to increase the minimum wage at least two to three times by redistributing budget resources and reducing theft and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Housing Prices:** Housing prices and mortgage costs will decrease significantly due to rationalization, increased efficiency, and establishing order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Currency:** It is always advisable to stock up on dollars or euros, as the ruble faces a "far from favorable prospect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency:** No ban on cryptocurrency or crypto exchanges is planned, as Russia "is in dire need to use the country itself and cryptocurrency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Cash Withdrawal Limits/Deposit Freezing:** In case of an "avalanche-like development of the financial crisis," the possibility of freezing deposits is not excluded, meaning limited access to funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Limits on card withdrawals, which already exist, would be tightened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Navalny's Gelendzhik Palace:** The ongoing reconstruction and demolition of the palace are seen as a "gigantic theft of budgets," with who will live in it being irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Access to Medicine:** People who are retired and in difficult social circumstances will receive vital drugs for free or with a significant discount (70-90%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.
*   **Weapons Legislation:** The tightening of weapons legislation reflects the authorities' fear of the people, especially armed individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. The speaker believes that the right to bear arms should be introduced in Russia after military actions conclude and society stabilizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.

### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
A significant number of people (from a third to a half) experience PTSD after military actions, leading to inadequate and socially dangerous behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. The current Russian authorities "do not care about this"; it is considered a societal problem, not theirs, as they believe they are protected from these "angry, disoriented people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.

### Data Leaks
Massive leaks of personal data from government agencies, often protected by interested parties within the agencies, can be stopped and those involved punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. Experts estimate it would take 3-6 months to stop such "Homeric fraud" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>.

### Risk of Civil War and Collapse
The "elite war" is not expected to escalate into a large-scale civil war or the collapse of the [[potential_political_and_military_actions_involving_russia | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. While armed excesses are probable, they will be localized, likely in the center of the Russian capital, and may even occur without the actual use of weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. There is a risk of a split or withdrawal of some territories, with the North Caucasus being the "most acute" crisis zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.

### Other Notable Points
*   **Prigozhin:** Evgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin is expected to "get in touch" and appear in the Russian Federation at a time he deems most favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.
*   **Team's Confidence:** The speaker's confidence in their team coming to power is based on knowledge of the specific societal situation and balance of power, as well as "some other things" that cannot be disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>.
*   **Stalin's Death:** Stalin was "not prevented from dying" and was not given timely medical care, a scenario depicted in "The Death of Stalin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.
*   **Monarchy:** The speaker personally believes that a monarchy, a different dynasty than Romanov, could make sense in the "very distant future" (15-20 years), serving as a symbol of unity and guardians of law and order, with extremely limited powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.
*   **Chemezov as President:** Theoretically possible, but Chemezov has no desire to be president; he prefers to govern or influence Russia from behind the scenes, similar to Patrushev Sr. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>.
*   **Blocking Social Networks:** Exercises to close social media and video hosting were unsuccessful, so the idea of closing YouTube, Telegram, or WhatsApp has been put on hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.

## Societal and Cultural Repression in Russia

The Russian government has escalated its control over various aspects of society, leading to a climate of [[repression_and_political_arrests_in_russia | increased repression]] and a shift towards a mobilization economy [00:07:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### Economic Mobilization and Labor Control
The government has appealed to the State Duma to amend federal law, introducing "special measures" in the economy [00:07:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This allows authorities to:
*   Prohibit firms, organizations, and enterprises, regardless of ownership, from refusing government orders and contracts related to military actions outside Russia [00:08:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   Change contract terms during their implementation [00:09:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   Interfere with labor relations within organizations, forcing employees to work at night, on weekends, and holidays, and even canceling vacations [00:09:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

This system is compared to the Soviet era on the eve of June 1941, where the economy was heavily connected to the military-industrial complex [00:09:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Such measures are seen as drawing Russia into a strategic trap, depleting its material, human, and moral resources, and leading to social, technological, and economic degradation [00:10:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, [00:11:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

### Suppression of Dissent
The Kremlin's primary concern has shifted from liberal critics (who mainly broadcast from outside Russia) to "turbo patriots" or "hurrah patriots" who criticize the government for not being harsh enough in its "special military operation" [00:11:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, [00:12:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The FSB has been instructed to "thin out the ranks" of these zealous critics from the right [00:12:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>, reinforcing that only the Kremlin has the right to determine what is "fair and unfair" or "needed and not" [00:12:39](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Citizens are expected to "keep their mouth shut and enthusiastically approve" all actions of the authorities [00:12:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

### Political Arrests and Cultural Closures
Recent events underscore the ongoing [[repression_and_political_arrests_in_russia | repression]] within Russia [00:17:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>:
*   **Vladimir Mau's Arrest**: Vladimir Mau, a highly influential rector and head of the Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, was placed under house arrest [00:17:37](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Despite having signed a letter in support of the "special military operation," his arrest sends a signal to "systemic liberals" that their loyalty is deemed worthless by the authorities [00:18:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
*   **Gogol Center Closure**: The Gogol Center, a highly useful and fascinating cultural venue, is being reverted to the Gogol Theater [00:19:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This closure reflects the government's imposition of a "mobilization regime" that leads to simplification and a rejection of "cultural complexities," demanding uniformity and loyalty [00:19:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

### Investor Rights Disregard
Gazprom's refusal to pay dividends for the first time since 1998, reportedly on direct state orders, illustrates the state's view of private investors as "freeloaders" [00:20:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. This signals that nothing truly belongs to them, especially as the regime enters a state of mobilization economy, which brings with it increased restrictions, harshness, simplification, and pressure [00:20:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.

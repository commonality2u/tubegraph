The eighteenth episode of Valery Solovyov's program, "What is Happening," aired on Monday, June 27, at about 1 PM, touched upon the question of whether [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] will "rein" [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] and the possibility of another "Second Front" involving Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Belarus's Role in Kaliningrad Transit Dispute

A new [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | conflict field]] has emerged following Lithuania's ban on a significant portion of transit to the Kaliningrad region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Russia is preparing to demonstrate force capabilities, currently engaging in "force blackmail" rather than direct actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. To exert pressure on Lithuania, Russia's strategy would ideally involve Belarus in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. Discussions may include provocations launched from Belarusian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Pressure for a Union State

Intensive negotiations between [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin and Lukashenko]] took place in the days leading up to the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]]'s "id√©e fixe" is to restore the unity of the Soviet Union, at least in the form of a union of East Slavic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

### Coercion and Lukashenko's Concessions
Pressure on [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] has reportedly escalated to "foul language" to compel him into a real union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. A key tactic for [[belarus_russia_relations_and_potential_union_treaty | involving Belarus in this union]] is to simultaneously draw it into the "network of force blackmail" that Russia might use against Lithuania <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, as well as involving the Belarusian military in confrontation with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

The situation during a special meeting between [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin and Lukashenko]] (likely on a Friday) was so "difficult and dramatic" that [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] reportedly gave his "consent" to the "Supreme Court," conveying a message of "only Leave me free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Despite this, it is considered unlikely that [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]], whom [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] allegedly nicknamed "the potato Elk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, will not try to "slip out of the embrace of the Moscow judoka" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, a skill he has demonstrated for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Even after giving consent "to go to all lengths," [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] is expected to attempt to avoid full compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

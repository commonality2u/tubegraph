This article, based on episode 37 of Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel "What's Happening," recorded on November 13, 2022, discusses the [[change_in_the_political_landscape_in_russia | changing political landscape]] and [[public_opinion_and_sociology_in_russia | public opinion]] in Russia following significant military developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The episode frames the situation as a "strategic turning point" and a "moral and political catastrophe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## The Withdrawal from Kherson and its Impact

The main event of the week leading up to the broadcast was the withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This withdrawal is viewed as a consolidation of a strategic turning point in favor of Ukraine, which began in late August/early September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The strategic initiative in the armed conflict has "finally passed to Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Moral and Political Catastrophe for Russia

While the loss of Kherson is not considered a military catastrophe, it represents a "moral and psychological and political catastrophe" for the Russian leadership and establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This event has led to a final loss of faith in victory within the Russian establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Previously, the establishment believed that while they could no longer win, defeat was unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Now, they must "get used to the idea of ​​the inevitability of military defeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Consequently, Vladimir Putin is increasingly seen by the establishment as a "toxic loser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The consequences of this moral and political catastrophe include:
*   **Confusion**: The propaganda machine and political headquarters are "at a loss" on how to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. This confusion is expected to be overcome by tightened censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Search for a way out**: There's an intensification in the search for a solution to the impasse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Blame for Putin**: Putin is recognized as the "main cause of the catastrophe," which is seen as not only moral and political but also partly global <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Elite Discontent**: There's a noticeable increase in discontent among the elite, posing a fundamental threat to Putin's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Peace Proposals

A peace proposal was received by the Russian leadership immediately after the withdrawal from Kherson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The general outline of these proposals, agreed upon with Ukraine, includes:
*   **Territorial Withdrawal**: Russia to completely leave Ukrainian territory, including the DPR and LPR, but excluding Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Crimea Status**: Crimea would receive an indefinite status for seven years, during which negotiations would be held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Crimea must be demilitarized, and the Black Sea Fleet must leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Demilitarized Zone**: A 100-kilometer deep demilitarized zone along the borders of Russia with Ukraine and Belarus with Ukraine, with heavy weapons removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Ukraine's Commitments**: Ukraine promises not to join NATO and not to raise questions about joining NATO for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Transnistria**: The Russian military base in Transnistria to be moved back to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Russia will not interfere with Transnistria's integration into Moldova in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Immunity for Russian Personnel**: Russian military, political, and civilian personnel are guaranteed freedom and security and preservation of at least some assets, meaning they would not be subject to punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. However, "scapegoats will be punished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

Indirect signs that the Russian leadership is taking these proposals seriously include:
*   **Suspension of Nuclear Plans**: Consideration of plans for tactical nuclear weapons use was "collapsed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, though these plans could easily be reactivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Erdogan's Mediation Efforts**: Turkish President Erdogan announced his intention to meet with Putin to discuss peace prospects, followed by a visit or call to Zelensky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Reduced Attacks on Infrastructure**: A potential sign would be Russia abandoning the idea of another massive strike on Ukraine's energy infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

While these proposals are taken seriously, it doesn't mean the Kremlin is ready to accept them; they may seek to gain time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Financial compensation for Ukraine's damage was not mentioned in the received materials but should be discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Political Shifts

The speaker acknowledges that [[public_opinion_and_sociology_in_russia | public opinion]] in Russia does not currently pose a significant force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. The Kremlin traditionally ignores it, only considering force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. A chance for [[public_perception_and_potential_triggers_for_sociopolitical_change_in_russia | public opinion]] to become a force exists "if this public opinion unites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

### Responsibility and Accountability

The speaker emphasizes that "good and justice do not necessarily win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>, and that life is unfair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. Both individuals and the nation are responsible for their actions, inaction, connivance, and silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

### Blaming the "Turbo Patriots"

The search for those to blame for Russia's defeat will begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. The military will likely be blamed later, after a peace treaty is signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. Initially, the blame will fall on "Turbo Patriots" – those who have been most vocal and are now criticizing the authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Figures like Igor Strelkov and Alexander Dugin, known for their ultra-nationalist views, are mentioned as potential targets for repression and intimidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

Along with this, censorship will be tightened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. There is a possibility that a new "false political target" party of "turbopatriots" will be created, possibly fronted by Strelkov and Dugin, to channel and control their discontent, perhaps in anticipation of early parliamentary elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>. This is described as a "well-known method of divorce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>.

### Ukraine's Role in Russian [[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | Sociopolitical Changes]]

Ukraine's military successes have influenced the situation, but it cannot directly influence the process of [[social_and_political_changes_in_russia | changing the political system]] or punishing the guilty in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Any [[sociopolitical_changes_and_reforms_in_russia | sociopolitical changes and reforms in Russia]] will need to be carried out by Russian citizens themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. The speaker believes Russians will be able to achieve change, but at a significant cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

### US Position

The US position is described as pragmatic: to inflict military defeat on Russia on the battlefield using "someone else's hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. However, there is no intention to directly change Russia's political system. Instead, the aim is to create conditions for this to happen naturally, as direct US interference could have negative consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. This position likely influences the overall [[internal_political_issues_and_public_perception_in_russia | internal political issues and public perception in Russia]] regarding the conflict.

The speaker advises viewers to "take things realistically" and avoid hysteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>. They emphasize the importance of productive action rather than mere online rage, especially considering the influence of bots and the need for purity of discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

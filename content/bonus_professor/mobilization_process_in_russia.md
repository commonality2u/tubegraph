## Forewarning for 2023
Valery Solovey, in the 46th episode of "What Happens," conveyed a grim outlook for 2023, suggesting that the phrase "Today we are alive, and this is our happiness" might become the motto for Russians throughout the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This pessimistic view is linked to Russian President Vladimir Putin's New Year's address, which Solovey described as a "clot of negative emotions," predicting 2023 to be a year of severe trials and military action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Legal Changes to Mobilization Summons
A significant development concerning the [[mobilization_and_military_policies_in_russia|mobilization]] process was noted just before the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. According to historian Alexei, a bill in the State Duma was in its third reading, which would legally allow [[legal_grounds_for_mobilization_in_russia|mobilization]] summons to be served via registered mail with notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### How the New Summons System Works
The new system is designed to streamline the notification process:
*   **Mailbox Delivery**: Individuals could find a notice in their mailbox around January 9-11, indicating a registered letter is waiting for them at the post office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Deemed Notification**: Upon receiving the registered letter concerning [[mobilization_and_military_policies_in_russia|mobilization]], the individual is considered legally notified as soon as they sign for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Refusal is Futile**: Even if a person refuses to take the letter from the military registration and enlistment office, or takes it but does not open it and returns it, the postman will note the refusal, and the summons will still be considered handed over and legally binding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Practical Advice for Citizens
Citizens are advised that if they receive a notice for a registered letter at the beginning of the year, it is likely a [[legal_grounds_for_mobilization_in_russia|summons]] for [[mobilization_and_military_policies_in_russia|military duty]], rather than a "letter of happiness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Individuals are urged to make decisions based on their own motives, core values, and life circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

> [!DANGER] Warning on Summons Letters
> "If you receive a notice that a registered letter awaits you, then this is not a letter of happiness, this is a letter calling on you to fulfill your patriotic duty." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>

## Societal State and Readiness
Russian society is described as very flexible and highly adaptive, allowing it to survive even under degrading conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. However, this adaptability also means society quickly gets used to hardship, enduring the unbearable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. There is a prevalent "moralism" where a significant portion of the population struggles to distinguish between good and evil, making them capable of "literally everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

The mental state of Russian society is characterized by deep depression and apathy, alongside agitation and a high readiness for aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. There's also a deep need to return to normalcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. Once emotions and aggression are "splashed out," it is believed society could move in a direction opposite to the current one, especially if led <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. This is likened to the Chinese phrase: "people grass, rulers wind â€“ wherever the wind blows, there our people will go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

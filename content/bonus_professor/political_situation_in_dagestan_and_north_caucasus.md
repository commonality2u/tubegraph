The [[the_political_climate_in_russia_and_government_policies | political climate in Russia]] and its governance deeply affect regions like Dagestan and the broader North Caucasus. The current administration's approach to these areas has implications for regional stability and internal power dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Governance in Dagestan

Dagestan is described as an "ethnically complex multi-component" region where there is a "constant, incessant struggle for resources" and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. To manage this internal complexity and competition, the Federal Center feels "forced to appoint a Varangian" (an outsider) as its ruler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This is because an appointed outsider can remain "conditionally equally distant from these ethnic groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

While this approach is acknowledged as "not a very good decision" and "difficult to call democratic," it is presented as the "only one so far possible" given the prevailing situation in Dagestan and the [[political_situation_in_russia | Russian Federation]] as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Influence of Regional Leaders

The influence of Ramzan Akhmatovich (Kadyrov) in the North Caucasus is considered unlikely to be "significantly inferior" to that of the federal center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This situation causes "very strong irritation" within the federal structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Federal Policy and Potential Conflicts

The "severity of the policy of the new government," specifically referring to the authorities under Nikolai Patrushev and his supporting group, is noted regarding the North Caucasus and its elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This tightening of relations is particularly evident with Chechnya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Observers suggest this approach could lead to "the creation of a conflict situation" and the "possibility of transition to an open conflict with the leadership of the Chechen Republic," which would carry "unpleasant consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

The idea of Kadyrov potentially marching on Moscow, leading to a civil war and the collapse of Russia, is considered to have an "insignificant" probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. However, the overall sentiment is that "almost everything is possible" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

## Russia's Influence in the South Caucasus

Despite imperial statements from figures like Lavrov about Russia's firm intention to prevent South Caucasus states from freely choosing their own development, Russia's actual ability to influence these regions is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>.

*   Russia "cannot prevent even Armenia from leaving the CSTO now," despite strong disapproval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.
*   Russia "cannot particularly influence" Georgia, and this will not change due to a lack of "soft levers of influence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.
*   Georgia serves as a "very important channel for re-export to Russia," making it counterproductive for Russia to apply pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.

The future relations between [[political_situation_in_russia | Russia]] and the South Caucasus region are expected to evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

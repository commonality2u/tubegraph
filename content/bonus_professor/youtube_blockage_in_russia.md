## Planned Nationwide Blocking
The Russian government has initiated steps towards a nationwide blocking of YouTube. Following successful exercises to slow down and disrupt YouTube's functionality, a decision was made to implement a full block on a national scale in August-September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This blocking is planned to be immediate, rather than a gradual slowdown, mirroring the approach taken with [[media_censorship_and_vpn_usage_in_russia | Facebook]] and Instagram, which are already banned in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. WhatsApp is also slated for blocking alongside YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### Reasons for Blocking
The primary motivation for blocking YouTube and WhatsApp stems from the authorities' desire to prevent protest mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **YouTube's Role:** It is seen as a significant source of information about current events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   **WhatsApp's Role:** It functions as a tool for coordinating actions and discussions, facilitating potential dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

The government believes that by blocking these platforms, they can preempt "much more serious problems" expected to arise in the fall and early winter, including [[cultural_and_societal_repression_within_russia | political]] and [[challenges_faced_by_businesses_and_workers_in_russia | economic crises]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

### Anticipated Public Reaction
The authorities' assessment, based on sociological data and previous experiences, suggests that while the blocking will cause a negative emotional reaction, it is not expected to escalate into widespread public protest or active opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. It is viewed as a calculated risk to mitigate more significant future issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## Impact and User Preparedness
The speaker predicts that YouTube will lose a substantial portion of its audience, potentially 30-40%, similar to the decline experienced by Instagram and Facebook after their bans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This loss is attributed to public fear of using prohibited platforms and a lack of technical expertise among many citizens to circumvent blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### Recommendations for Users
To navigate the impending blocks, several recommendations are offered:
*   **Acquire VPNs:** Users are strongly advised to obtain one or more reliable [[media_censorship_and_vpn_usage_in_russia | VPNs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. It is acknowledged that this will lead to an ongoing "battle" between authorities blocking VPNs and providers finding new ways to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Information on VPNs:** The Russian authorities have also moved to block any public information, advertising, or technical instructions regarding VPN usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Users are encouraged to seek help from friends or acquaintances who already use VPNs for guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Register on Telegram:** Users are urged to create accounts on Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. The authorities have assessed Telegram as virtually impossible to block, based on previous unsuccessful attempts, and therefore do not plan to ban it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Telegram is presented as a crucial platform for receiving operational information during potential critical situations in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Support for Alternative Media:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of supporting independent information sources, noting that financial contributions are vital for their continued operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. This assistance is framed as an action for [[future_of_russian_media_and_freedom_of_speech | Russia's freedom]] and the well-being of future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>.

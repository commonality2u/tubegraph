The public discourse surrounding the [[potential_use_of_nuclear_weapons | possibility of using nuclear weapons]] has shifted dramatically, with Russian officials now openly hinting at such actions against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This development is described as "strange" and "phantasmagoric," especially when considering that six months prior, such discussions would have seemed inappropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Current Stance and Rhetoric

Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated that Russia is currently considering only conventional weapons in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. However, the phrase "at this stage" suggests that other stages of conflict development between Russia and Ukraine are possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. While this is often perceived as blackmail, the speaker warns against underestimating President Putin's readiness for decisive action, citing the troop concentration on Ukraine's border that was initially called blackmail but led to armed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Crucially, within President Putin's immediate circle, no one is dissuading him from [[potential_use_of_nuclear_weapons | using tactical nuclear weapons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. His inner circle is reportedly confident that he will make this decision sooner or later, resigning themselves to its inevitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Reasons for Changing Perceptions of Nuclear Use

Several factors contribute to the normalization of discussions around [[potential_use_of_weapons_of_mass_destruction | nuclear weapons]] use:

1.  **Lack of Personal War Experience Among Politicians**
    In the modern world, there are no politicians with personal experience of surviving war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This detachment may contribute to a decreased understanding of the true consequences of conflict.

2.  **War as an Acceptable Political Tool**
    War is increasingly viewed as an acceptable means of conducting politics, especially when economic power or intelligence are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Russia is cited as having "opened Pandora's box" in this regard, specifically in 2014, with misfortunes that could "return by law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

3.  **Shift in Russia's View on Nuclear Admissibility**
    Russia's perspective on the admissibility of [[potential_use_of_nuclear_weapons | nuclear weapons]] use has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This is partly attributed to the lack of personal war experience among current world leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Russia's strategic concept includes "escalation through escalation," where the threat of [[nuclear_threats_and_economic_sanctions | nuclear weapons]] is seen as a lever to bring a hypothetical enemy to their senses and force them to agree to Russian conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

4.  **President Putin's Personal Profile**
    The speaker believes the decisive factor in the admissibility of [[potential_use_of_nuclear_weapons | nuclear weapons]] use is the "personal profile of President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The speaker suggests that judging by his actions, what might be in his head "does not inspire any optimism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

The ongoing "special military operation" has led to significant discussions and changes within Russian society, particularly concerning the possibility of mobilization and its potential [[public_opinion_and_its_impact_on_russian_political_dynamics | societal impacts]].

## Shifting Military Goals and Societal Impact

The military operation, recorded on May 6th, has entered a positional phase, characterized by skirmishes rather than major breakthroughs or envelopments reminiscent of 1943 operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Battles are described as "long and stubborn" for populated areas, many previously unknown to the Russian public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>.

Initially, Russian military policy aimed to "knock out" Ukraine's resources and demoralize Ukrainian society to force a peace treaty on Russia's terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. However, Ukraine continues to receive resources faster than Russia can neutralize them, and the goal of demoralizing Ukrainian society has not been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Russia, unlike Ukraine, faces limitations in military resources, as no external assistance is provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Questions have arisen regarding the moral, political, and psychological state of the Russian Armed Forces and Russian society itself, particularly concerning the actual goal of the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The goals have been rewritten multiple times:
*   Initially: "denazification" and "demilitarization" of Ukraine, implying complete political control and regime change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   More modest current task: complete control of Donbass and the Azov coast, with the Black Sea coast as a maximum task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

High-ranking Russian military leaders, including General Staff generals, reportedly doubt whether even the limited goals of the second stage of the special operation can be achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Discussion of Mass Mobilization

The topic of mobilization has become central, not just discussed, but actively prepared for since the first day of the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The Security Council, which reports to President Putin via Nikolai Patrushev, claims that from an organizational and technical standpoint, everything is ready for mobilization, and it will not lead to negative political consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

However, historical context suggests skepticism, as similar reports about the impossibility of conflict with Ukraine were made before February 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The logic guiding Putin is stated to be fundamentally different from that of experts, as demonstrated by the events of February 24th and subsequent developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Decision and Implementation of Mobilization

A decision for mobilization has been made by the President of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. However, its implementation is not 100% certain, and the exact timing remains unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. May 9th was discussed as a possibility but was just one option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

Plans are to mobilize approximately half a million people in multiple stages (3-4 stages), with the possibility of ending after the first, depending on public and political reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

Tools for mobilization currently discussed include:
*   Military registration and enlistment office employees visiting homes, accompanied by police officers and mobilization specialists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   Blocking bank cards of those subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   Closing borders for those subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### Justification and Escalation

Mass mobilization would need to be preceded by events that, from a propaganda standpoint, justify the need for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. These events would need to portray Ukraine as posing an "existential threat" to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Examples include:
*   Chemical attacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   Terrorist attacks in large Russian cities, including Moscow and St. Petersburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

Such actions would serve as a public pretext to declare the homeland in danger, shifting the conflict's status from a "special military operation" to a "full-fledged and large-scale war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. This shift would also legitimize the possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons, under the premise that an existential threat must be destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

## Societal Response and Individual Strategies

The speaker suggests that public discussion and critical opposition to mobilization could influence Putin through Federal Security Service reports on [[public_opinion_and_its_impact_on_russian_political_dynamics | public sentiment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. However, the chances of preventing mobilization are considered slim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>.

The speaker highlights the need for individual strategies for "salvation" for those who do not wish to be mobilized, promising hints and tips in a future program episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. The public is encouraged to take responsibility for their own decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

The use of mass destruction weapons, though seemingly implausible to many, is compared to the unexpected start of the conflict on February 24th, suggesting that "other forms of thinking" with "colossal power" are at play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

## Psychological Impact on Russian Leadership and Society

There are signs of psychological distress within the Russian elite, indicated by "hysterical statements" from public figures (e.g., TV presenters, mass media figures, a minister), displaying cynicism, baseness, or questionable logic, such as a statement regarding Adolf Hitler's ethnic origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This reflects an atmosphere of "despair and anger" at both the bottom and top levels of Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. This points to the broader [[impact_of_military_crisis_on_russian_internal_politics_and_society | impact of the military crisis on Russian internal politics and society]].

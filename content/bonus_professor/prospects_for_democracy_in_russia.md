Russia is expected to become a free and democratic state within the current lifetime, though this transformation is anticipated to be a long-term process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Path to Freedom and Democracy

While the shift to a free state may not take a significant amount of time, the establishment of a truly democratic system, with functioning institutions and procedures, is projected to require at least 10 to 15 years, possibly more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Anticipated Turmoil and Recovery

The country is predicted to face [[future_political_and_social_changes_in_russia | approaching turmoil]] which is seen as inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. This period of upheaval is expected to be a major crisis, potentially more dangerous and acute than the crisis of 1993 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Despite the severity, it is believed that Russia will not collapse or cease to exist in its current form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. The country and its society are expected to cope with these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Driving Forces of Change
The main driving force for political change in Russia is not expected to be the [[current_and_future_prospects_for_russian_opposition | Russian opposition]] or general society, but rather the elites, with change developing as an elite conflict where factions may seek societal support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Outlook for the Future
Despite the current gloomy prospects, there is an optimistic view that a "new Russia" awaits at the end of the challenging period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>. It is asserted that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>.

### Political Change and Stability
Regarding the [[potential_political_changes_in_russia_after_putin | change of power]], the chances for such a shift within the current year are considered small, though not zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. It is more likely to occur in the [[future_political_changes_and_developments_in_russia | next year]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Initially, a [[future_political_changes_in_russia | change of power]] may lead to a worse situation, though not for a prolonged period (possibly a few months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Internal events, not always visible to the public, are capable of influencing and stimulating a [[potential_political_changes_and_future_leadership_in_russia | change of power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. While there is no 100% guarantee these events will occur, the term of the current leadership's "legal capacity" is described as extremely limited, a fact known to both the leader and his entourage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. The entourage may accelerate this process, especially as military action escalates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

## External Relations Post-Transition
Should there be a transition away from the current [[political_situation_in_russia | political situation]], external threats, particularly in the western direction, are expected to be significantly minimized or disappear entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The primary challenge and danger is then identified as being in the East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

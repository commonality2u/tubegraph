The Bon religion is considered one of the world's most complex and mysterious religions, with origins tracing back to a prehistoric period devoid of written monuments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Its origins are impossible to fully study due to the lack of historical documentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Historical and New Bon

There are two main versions of Bon:
*   **Historical Bon**: Described as an "indivisible and eternal fight" practiced in Nepal, Tanya, and Western Mongolia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **New Bon**: This version is adapted to Buddhism and shares nothing in common with the eternal or historical Bon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

Modern practices in Nepal, presented as ancient Bon, are often "picturesque eclectic performance[s]" featuring elements of Gallic and Tibetan dance, and animal and bird sacrifices, conducted by Buddhist monks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. These performances are not representative of authentic Bon practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Interpretations and Misconceptions

Researchers hold various, often contradictory, views on Bon:
*   Some characterize it as [[influence_of_shamanism_in_political_contexts | shamanism]] with animistic elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   Others see it as a current within the cult of Kolya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   A third perspective claims it is "Tibetan Satanism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   These are dismissed as "not very smart judgments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Historically, Bon was subjected to "very serious and aggressive persecution" by peace-loving (in quotation marks) Buddhists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Pseudo-Studies and Falsification
In the 20th century, numerous "custom-made pseudo-studies" emerged, aiming to portray Bon as "bloody and cruel" to the "progressive West" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. These studies lacked any "superficial contact with the priests of Bon" or access to authentic texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. All descriptions of Bon practices in these studies are based on Buddhist sources, which in turn refer to texts that either never existed or were fictional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. An example of such fictionalized accounts is Nikolai Roerich's *Altai Himalaya*, which compared Bon to Christianity and concluded it was an "evil and extremely negative phenomenon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

These conclusions were often based on descriptions by Buddhist monks, including one associated with Baron Ungern, a "wandering monk" named Ja Lama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. However, the rituals conducted by Ja Lama were of the "new Bon," which has nothing in common with the eternal Bon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. The tragic consequences for Baron Ungern after these pseudo-rituals are noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### True Nature of Bon
The true nature of the Bon religion is "covered by a multi-stage veil" of secrets and exists "beyond the rational" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. Its temple complexes are found in hard-to-reach, non-man-made labyrinthine caves in the Nepalese Himalayas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.

### Authentic Bon Rituals
The speaker confirms having personally witnessed authentic Bon rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:16">[01:11:16]</a>. These practices are described as capable of changing the algorithm of fate and teaching individuals to control events in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. The fundamental practice of Bon is the achievement of a state of non-duality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>. This state, which Lao Tzu spoke of as the discrepancy between feeling and reason, allows a person to comprehend "very many secrets of being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:29">[01:13:29]</a>. Bon is a "closed" religion because modern people are "not able to understand these truly harmonious practices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:49">[01:13:49]</a>. Warrior priests believe that those who accidentally comprehend this knowledge will use it not for their own or society's benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:01">[01:14:01]</a>.

The practices aim to achieve harmony and balance, overcome oneself, and pass through "distorted centuries of nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:22">[01:14:22]</a>. The dominant warrior cults are described as "very difficult" and "no less bloody" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>.

## Egregor Ritual
An "egregor" is defined as a non-material, complex energy substance that can change the trajectory of a person's fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:39">[01:15:39]</a>. The idea embedded within the egregor determines its outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>. Two crucial periods in its formation are the creation of its central part and its culmination (on the 50th day) when it gains maximum strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:25">[01:16:25]</a>. Events during these periods determine the future vector and radically transform what seemed unshakable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>.

### Ritual Against Putin
A specific Bon ritual targeting Vladimir Putin was performed on June 21, 2020, during a solar eclipse (137 Saros period) in Corrigan Taxcom, Nepal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:15">[01:15:15]</a>. This ritual aimed to create an egregor to alter the fate of an individual whose destiny is linked to the entire post-Soviet space, referring to the President of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>.

*   **Central part formation**: Coincided with a "famous event" and "peace process" in Khabarovsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:03">[01:17:03]</a>.
*   **Maximum strength (50th day)**: On August 9, 2020, elections in Belarus escalated into a large-scale protest, effectively canceling the Kremlin's desired unification project between Russia and Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.
*   **Consequence**: From August 9, 2020, it can be stated that the "luck factor" abandoned the leader, and "fortune turned its back on him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>.

Metaphysical practices can create "serious fluctuations in the vector of movement," leading to the awakening of the masses from a state of "pseudo wakefulness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. However, real change requires the free will and action of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:23">[01:18:23]</a>.

### Russian Confirmation of the Ritual
The Federal Security Service (FSB) was instructed to verify the information about this ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:06">[01:19:06]</a>. Specialists sent by the Kremlin traveled to the "Celestial Empire" and Balkhash, where they met with lamas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:23">[01:19:23]</a>. The lamas confirmed that if such a ritual was performed, it was indeed about the leader, and it is "absolutely impossible to change" the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:37">[01:19:37]</a>. Tibetan Buddhism, or Buddhism in general, is unable to cancel the final effect of these Bon rituals, because they lack knowledge of key details of Bon practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:02">[01:20:02]</a>.

Valery Solovey addresses various aspects of the upcoming second round, or continuation, of the [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | partial mobilization]] in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Many questions from the audience pertain to the potential blocking of bank accounts and cards as a means to enforce conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Enforcing Mobilization: Restrictions and Incentives

### Restrictions on Citizens
Current amendments to the law on the creation of a single register of military personnel include several restrictions, but notably, they **do not** explicitly mention the blocking of bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Other types of restrictions in place are:
*   A ban on traveling to the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   A ban on real estate transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   A ban on registering as an individual entrepreneur, which may also extend to general activities within an individual entrepreneur framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   A ban on driving a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

However, these existing restrictions are deemed largely ineffective for a significant portion of the population. For instance, only about 20% of the population possesses foreign passports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, and not everyone owns a car or is an individual entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. There is currently no criminal punishment for evading [[mobilization and military efforts | mobilization]] in the Criminal Code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. During the initial [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | partial mobilization]], not a single person was punished administratively or criminally for evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Potential Blocking of Bank Accounts and Cards
The blocking of bank accounts and cards is considered the "easiest and most effective way" to compel people to report to military registration and enlistment offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. While not in the current law, this measure is seen as a very effective tool that was deliberately excluded from the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The banking system, under Nabiullina, has been preparing for such a scenario since September of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Such blocking would likely target individuals who receive electronic summonses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

When accounts are unblocked, individuals would be expected to fulfill their "sacred patriotic duty" and potentially be sent to training camps or directly to the front line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Promises of initial payments (e.g., 40,000 rubles and then 160,000 rubles at the front) would be made, though the speaker notes the uncertainty of receiving this money or returning alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Hunting for Conscripts and Setting Traps
The authorities are not expected to "hunt for everyone" but rather to "set traps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. These traps would be placed in busy areas with high pedestrian traffic, such as:
*   Train stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>
*   Large city metro stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>
*   Supermarkets in small to medium-sized cities, where police patrols and military registration staff could be stationed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>

The expectation is that many will come voluntarily due to difficult circumstances, such as blocked cards, or the allure of potential earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Conscripts and Contracts
There is an expectation that conscripts may be pressured to sign contracts for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. New amendments allow individuals to be taken for contract service almost immediately upon entering military service, whereas previously it required three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

## Preparing for Mobilization

### Personal Financial Preparedness
To protect oneself from potential financial restrictions, individuals are advised to:
*   Save personal money in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   Be ready to "spin" and adapt to adverse circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, preparing for the worst based on decades of experience in the Soviet Union and Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Travel and Movement Restrictions
During martial law, there could be a ban on the movement of Russians between regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. Those potentially subject to [[mobilization_strategies_and_preparations | mobilization]] (a database estimated at 15 million people, rapidly expanding) would likely face travel restrictions, but other categories like women, pensioners, and children would probably still be able to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

Reservists should be wary of traveling around Russia by plane and train, as these are places with busy traffic where those who could be called up might be monitored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Those who receive a summons are at particular risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>, and changing trains might be a strategy to avoid detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

### Advice for Specific Groups

#### Students
Students, including those in correspondence, full-time, and part-time courses, generally have the right to a deferment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. However, graduates (bachelor's and master's degree completers) are in a risk group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. While their deferment formally extends until September 1st, it is sometimes ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. It is advisable for them to seek a master's degree or an enterprise that provides a reservation to avoid conscription and [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

#### Russians Abroad
The advisability of men currently outside the Russian Federation returning to their families at the end of summer or beginning of September depends solely on the dynamics of politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. If Russia faces further military defeats, the scale of [[potential_future_mobilization_and_military_strategies | mobilization]] and the risk of martial law will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

#### Family Members and Legal Advice
Regarding removing someone from military registration by proxy if they live abroad, it is advised not to communicate with Russian authorities or provide information about a son, suggesting authorities contact them directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. If forced to sign a contract, individuals should refuse to sign anything and contact lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Outlook on Mobilization and Public Opinion

While there is accumulating latent discontent regarding [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_Russia | military operations and mobilization in Russia]] and the current government, this potential for public action is not yet sufficient on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. It will require other circumstances and their combination to transform into public action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

The speaker believes that if the current political crisis is moderate in duration (around a year and a half), Russia's unity will be preserved, and the risks of collapse are negligible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>. However, if the crisis is prolonged, these risks would increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>.

### Role of Propaganda
Propaganda is effective due to its massiveness and by depriving individuals of alternative viewpoints, leading to a "spiral of silence" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>. Ukrainian propaganda is currently considered more effective than Russian propaganda, especially for an external audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

### Political Action and Risks
The speaker's stance on political action is contextual:
*   When risks are relatively small, such as during elections or referendums (e.g., on the Constitution), participation is encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>.
*   When risks for people are "colossally high" and individuals are unable to act, the speaker advises against direct action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.
*   Support can take forms such as reposts or financial assistance to those fighting for freedom and justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>.

Calling for direct action in the current dangerous context is seen as irresponsible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>.

### Future of Security Forces
If the situation in the country changes for the better, the security forces, numbering over 1.5 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>, would undergo significant reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. Some would be retired, others subject to lustration, and some would remain to serve in reformed structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. The judicial system is highlighted as needing reform first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:50">[00:35:50]</a>. Full reform, while not immediate, is considered solvable within several years given sufficient political will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:08">[00:36:08]</a>.

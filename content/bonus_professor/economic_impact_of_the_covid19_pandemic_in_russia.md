The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent government measures have led to significant [[economic_impacts_of_sanctions_on_russia | economic challenges]] in Russia, particularly for businesses and citizens.

## Government Response and Public Perception

Initially, President Vladimir Putin declared the need to issue citizens mortgages at 6.5% per annum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. However, experts questioned the feasibility of such proposals given the national currency's collapse by 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The Central Bank stated it was not responsible for the national currency's rate, attributing fluctuations to non-residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

There's an impression that the government is struggling to devise solutions without using budget money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Promises of cheap loans from the president are expected to come with difficult, almost impossible, conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Banks have reportedly refused to provide interest-free loans even to government ministers, indicating that the president's will does not always translate into action when it comes to supporting the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The state is seen as capable only of humiliating people and taking from them, not of building or giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

In contrast to the US, which provided citizens with $1200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, Russia promised businesses only one minimum wage per registered employee per month as assistance, and only if they emerge from quarantine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. This approach is described as cynical, suggesting citizens should "learn time to cut sin and live yourselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

The government also plans to spend 25 million rubles on billboards near metro stations to publicize business support measures, which are largely ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. For instance, Sberbank was not accepting applications for 0% loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. Such propaganda is expected to cause "the strongest irritation" among the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.

## Impact on Businesses and Employment

The Moscow mayor's decision to close construction sites drew sharp criticism from figures like Aras Agalarov, owner of Crocus City Hall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. Construction is recognized as a vital sector for the economy with a huge multiplier effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a>. Agalarov highlighted that migrant workers on these sites live in "prison conditions," warning of epidemic and criminal consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>. It was suggested that wealthy business owners, who have extracted "super profit," should send migrants home at their own expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

The initial quarantine for a month was considered a "fatal shot to the economy," and extending self-isolation is seen as a "control shot in the head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. Small and medium businesses, which are comprised of ordinary citizens, are severely affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>.

The number of unemployed people in Moscow alone is estimated to be half a million, not including migrants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. Many businesses, such as cafes, restaurants, and fitness centers, are expected to close permanently, turning into "a cemetery" of illuminated signs but empty premises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>.

## Public Financial Distress and Outlook

The general consensus is that the [[state_of_the_russian_economy | economic situation in Russia]] will worsen significantly in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. A survey indicated that 60-65% of Russian families did not have enough money to last even one month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:49">[00:41:49]</a>.

The consequences of the crisis are expected to be very serious, leading to widespread unemployment and significant issues within the financial and banking sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>.

Despite increasing aggression and irritation within society, mass protests are not expected in May, but rather in the fall, when the [[economic_challenges_in_russia | economic impacts]] become undeniable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:51">[00:40:51]</a>. The suggested agenda for any future protests includes the "unconditional" resignation of the president and government, and the formation of a "government of national salvation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. This is seen as a matter of the nation's physical survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. The article concludes that Russia's fate will depend solely on the actions of its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>.

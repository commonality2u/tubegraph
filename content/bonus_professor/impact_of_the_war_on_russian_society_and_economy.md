The ongoing conflict has led to significant shifts within Russia, impacting both its society and economy. These changes are evident in political behavior, societal attitudes, economic conditions, and the implementation of new laws and restrictions.

## Political and Societal Adjustments

The President of the Russian Federation has refused to hold several large-scale public events traditionally held at the end of the year, including a New Year's reception and a major press conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The annual message to the Federal Assembly also remained in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Three primary reasons are cited for these changes:
*   **Lack of Public Statements**: The President has nothing to say in response to potential pressing questions, and any truthful question is considered unwanted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Health Concerns**: The President is reportedly unable to withstand the long hours and intense stress of such events, with doctors advising against exposing him to such risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Security Precautions**: There is a concern that Ukrainian aircraft are capable of deep penetration into Russian territory, and the Russian air defense system may not be able to identify or detain them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The risk of unidentified aircraft appearing over the Kremlin during public addresses is a significant deterrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

For security, the President reportedly intends to celebrate the New Year deep underground, far from Moscow and potentially beyond the Urals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Discussions suggest the possibility of delivering the message to the Federal Assembly virtually from this protected location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Military Strategy and its Internal [[impact_of_military_crisis_on_russian_internal_politics_and_society | Impact]]

A core element of Russia's military strategy is the transformation of the country into a "military camp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This includes:
*   **Resumption of Mobilization**: Signs indicate that a second stage of mobilization is underway, starting with document verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Many citizens have reported receiving invitations to military registration and enlistment offices for document checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This second stage is expected to be more massive than the initial "partial mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.
*   **Increase in Military Service Term**: A Moscow region military commissar, Lieutenant Colonel Fotin, indicated that military service would be increased to one and a half years from spring 2023, and potentially two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Despite official denials, the speaker suggests this information is widely known within military circles as preparation for future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
*   **Martial Law Elements**: There are clear signs of the introduction of elements of martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. This includes restrictions on travel abroad and even movement between regions for employees of major corporations like Rostec and Rosneft, and their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Top management of Rosneft is advised not to leave Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. This is compared to a "secondary vision of serfdom" where everyone serves the state, including the nobility, by being attached to their workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

## [[Hidden mobilization and economic impact in Russia | Economic and Social Impact]]

The implementation of martial law implies a shift towards a mobilization economy with attachment to the workplace, meaning people may not be able to quit their jobs or move freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

Other expected economic changes include:
*   **Redistribution of Assets**: Assets from "wrong oligarchs" (those critical of the state or unwilling to contribute their capital to the war effort) are expected to be transferred to the state or "patriotic oligarchs" who have suffered [[impact_of_sanctions_on_the_russian_economy | losses from sanctions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.
*   **Threat to Small and Medium-sized Businesses**: While there are no current plans for nationalization, regional security agencies may target profitable small and medium-sized businesses if they deem owners unpatriotic, potentially leading to criminal cases and asset seizures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

The **[[Impact of propaganda on Russian society | impact of propaganda on Russian society]]** has also been observed. The concept of a "people's war" proposed by the presidential administration may become the core of agitation and propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. However, recent sociology suggests that this propaganda is not working as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. TV viewers have largely stopped watching propaganda talk shows, opting for entertainment content instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. People are tired of the hysteria from official propagandists and want to forget the conflict and its associated risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. A study by Mediascope showed only one propaganda show in the top 100 most popular TV programs recently, a significant drop from previous months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>.

Societal economic well-being is declining:
*   **Declining Incomes**: The incomes of Russians are becoming lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>.
*   **Reduced Spending**: Sociology indicates that 70% of citizens reduced their expenses in the third quarter of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. People are saving on clothes, eating out, replacing household items, refusing vacations, and delaying new electronics purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.
*   **New Year Spending**: On the eve of New Year, people plan to buy fewer and cheaper gifts for themselves, relatives, and friends compared to the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. Even those with money are saving, anticipating a "real black day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

The authorities anticipate potential resistance to mobilization, particularly from women's protests. Preliminary orders have been given to security forces to "suppress mercilessly" any women's protests, reflecting a "do not spare the bullets" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

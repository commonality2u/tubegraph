## Military Arrests and Alleged "Underground" Activities in Russia

The program's main topic, titled "The Defeat of the Tracks of the Military Underground," draws its phrasing as a parody of 1930s Soviet Union vocabulary. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> This refers to a series of arrests of high-ranking military personnel in Russia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>

### Recent Arrests of High-Ranking Military Personnel
Over the past month, five high-ranking military personnel have been arrested, with four of them being generals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   **Economic Background Allegations:**
    *   Early arrests of Timur Ivanov and Kuznetsov were initially discussed with an economic background. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
    *   Formally, later arrests of Army Commander Popov and Vadim Shamarin (Gerasimov's deputy) were also accused of economic crimes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> For instance, Ivan Popov was accused of stealing 12 tons of metal products. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
*   **Underlying Political Motives:** Despite formal economic charges, the arrests of Popov and Shamarin are suggested to have a different, political background. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> The fifth arrest involved a colonel or lieutenant colonel engaged in purchasing military products. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> The speaker notes that these arrests are no longer just rumors, but openly discussed as a "military mutiny" exposed by military counterintelligence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> This alleged "hydra" or "Trotsky military conspiracy" was even linked to Khodorkovsky. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>

### Possibility of Military Rebellion
While the speaker uses sarcasm to describe the official narrative of a "military mutiny," they assert that a rebellion in Russia is certainly possible. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>
*   **Prigozhin's Rebellion:** The speaker cites Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin's rebellion on June 24 last year as a clear demonstration of this possibility, when he "almost reached the Russian capital." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a> (The speaker also debunks recent photos/videos of Prigozhin, stating he was not in Chad or Africa, but is now in "tempting proximity to Russian borders." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>)
*   **Historical Precedent:** An attempt at a military rebellion also occurred in 1998, organized by General Lev Rokhlin, which reportedly had "good chances for implementation." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>

### Implications for the Russian Regime
The speaker emphasizes that whether a rebellion was genuinely being prepared or if the case was falsified by military counterintelligence is less important than the fact that the discussion of a military mutiny has become "part of the political reality in Russia." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>
The fact that a military mutiny is being discussed is seen as "a completely clear, obvious, an ominous sign of the weakness of the political system and the weakness of the regime." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> The speaker suggests that while the "Putin regime" may be preserved, its "fabric is beginning to creep," and the regime is "beginning to weaken." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>

### Other Key Topics
The program also addresses other significant issues:
*   **Putin's Alleged Double in Belarus:** The speaker discusses a recent visit by the "so-called Putin," identified as "Yevgeny Vasilyevich, Putin's double," to Belarus for a meeting with Alexander Grigorievich Lukashenko. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a> The speaker points to Lukashenko's greeting, "I am glad to welcome you to your native Belarusian land," as evidence, implying the double is from Mogilev, Belarus. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a> This meeting, according to the speaker, suggests Lukashenko's dominance and mockery of the double, reinforcing the idea that the original Putin died. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>
*   **Ukraine's Legitimacy and Yanukovych:** A key outcome of the Belarus meeting was a statement about "illegitimate Zelensky." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> The speaker argues that Lukashenko (who "lost the elections" in Belarus) and the "Putin double" (from a "profanation" of an election in Russia) are in no position to declare Zelensky illegitimate, especially during a war for survival. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a> The speaker suggests this was an attempt to discredit Zelensky and the upcoming Switzerland conference. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a> Former Ukrainian President Yanukovych was allegedly "forced to fly to Minsk" to support claims of an illegitimate Ukrainian government and present a "legitimate candidate" to lead "liberated lands of Ukraine." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a> Yanukovych, who was "urgently left Ukraine in the train of Russian troops," is described as seriously ill. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a> The Russian officer who extracted Yanukovych later became a "Hero of Russia" and was involved in the Salisbury case. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>
*   **NATO and Hybrid War with Russia:** The speaker discusses Russia's intent to change the "strategic context" of the conflict with Ukraine by distracting the West and NATO. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a> This involves creating a "new field of tension in Europe," particularly in the Baltic countries (Latvia and Estonia), due to their large "Russian-speaking population." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a> This is envisioned as a "hybrid operation" where the military component is only used at the final stage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a> Initial stages involve generating chaos through cyberattacks on banking, state, and municipal institutions, as well as damaging navigation systems in the Baltic Sea area. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a> NATO, in response, has stated that it could apply Article 5 on collective defense in the event of a serious cyberattack, with Stoltenberg explicitly warning Moscow that a response could be not only in cyberspace but "also in other areas." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a> The speaker questions if NATO will follow through, noting past hesitation to give a tough response, fearing that Russia might declare such actions as threatening enough to [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_russia | use nuclear weapons]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a> However, the speaker believes the current Russian leadership does not intend to use nuclear weapons, but rather employs "nuclear vocabulary, nuclear rhetoric, and nuclear blackmail." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>

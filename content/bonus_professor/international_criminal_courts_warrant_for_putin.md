The International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued a warrant for Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, on suspicion of committing war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, specifically concerning crimes on the territory of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This development, which "crept up unnoticed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, occurred at the end of the week, coloring the weekend for some in "rainbow colors" and for others in "gloomy mourning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Recognition and Expectations

While Russia does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC, nor do countries like China, India, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, no one seriously expects Putin to voluntarily or forcibly end up in The Hague for interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Nevertheless, the issuance of this warrant has already "greatly influenced the situation in Russia and in the world" and is expected to influence it "even more noticeably, even more strongly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## Impact of the Warrant

### Legal and Symbolic Aspect
The warrant serves as a "very important precedent and the first step" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. The persecution of senior officials of the Russian Federation has been transferred from the political and propaganda spheres to the legal plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This has caused high-ranking Russian officials to cringe, despite public declarations of solidarity with their leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. The United States, despite skepticism towards the ICC, is prepared to actively participate in organizing the court for crimes in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

### Domestic Political Aspect
Before February 24, Putin was seen as a "guarantor of wealth and privileges" for the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. However, after February 24, he became a "toxic asset" that the elite wishes to discard and cleanse themselves of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. While the Russian elite may react passively with internal grumbling and external solidarity, there are groups within the elite capable of "extremely decisive actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. There is a growing sense that their desire and capabilities for such actions could significantly increase and materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. The visit of Xi Jinping to Moscow is noted as a potential "trigger for certain actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

### International Political Aspect
Putin is now considered a "leper" and a "toxic asset" in the international arena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Many are unwilling to communicate with him, and a "Black Mark" has been sent to the Russian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. The German Minister of Justice has stated that Putin would be arrested if he appeared on German territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This signifies a "cardinal change" in the atmosphere around the Russian president, the Kremlin, and within the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

### Psychological Impact on Putin
The warrant has driven Putin into a "deep depression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Although he might have anticipated such an event, its reality has significantly affected his already less-than-optimal mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. This upset mental state carries an increased risk of "unforeseen actions" and "dangerous decisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. His closest circle, described as having "cold heads" and "cold hearts," also understands this risk and is now seriously considering the implications for the future, which appears "extremely unpleasant" and much closer than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

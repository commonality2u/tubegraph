The outcome of US presidential elections is considered a significant factor influencing global peace and international relations, particularly concerning the [[Russia Ukraine conflict | Russia-Ukraine conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The Russian leadership, including the Kremlin, adjusts its domestic and international policies based on these election results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Initial Contact and Perceptions of Peace
Following the US elections, on November 6, two Russian elite coalitions, led by Chemezov and Patrushev, extended "enthusiastic congratulations" to Donald Trump through informal channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. These messages indicated a belief that with Trump, "the knot of contradictions around Ukraine" would be untied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Trump responded on the same day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. His response to both messages referred to the situation between [[Russia Ukraine conflict | Russia and Ukraine]] as an "incident" that it was "time to end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This phrasing reflects Trump's broader foreign policy views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

Messages from the Russian side also proposed a "truce" as a necessary preliminary stage for peace negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Direct Consultation and Kremlin's Peace Terms
On November 7, a conversation reportedly took place between Trump and Russia's acting president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Trump inquired about who holds decision-making power on the Russian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. During this discussion, the Kremlin outlined its desired "contours of the world" for peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, which included:
*   **Crimea** remaining on the Russian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Donetsk and Luhansk regions** (in their administrative borders) remaining on the Russian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Exchange of territories:** Ukraine would cede the Kursk region in exchange for Russia giving up fragments of territories it controls in the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
*   **Land corridor to Crimea:** The Kremlin previously insisted on retaining a land corridor to Crimea, but during this conversation, it stepped back from this demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. It proposed abandoning the idea of maintaining a land corridor, provided that Ukraine guarantees unimpeded transit of goods and people from mainland Russia to the Crimean peninsula through Ukrainian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

Trump's response to these proposals was a pause, stating he could not comment offhand and would consider them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. A leak about this conversation, likely authorized, suggests that some individuals in Trump's circle view these proposals as "unrealistic and undesirable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Trump's Motivations and Constraints
Trump views the [[Russia Ukraine conflict | Ukraine-Russia conflict]] as a "subordinate position" within his worldview, which is heavily influenced by commercial logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. He holds a strong motivation to act as a peacemaker, aiming for an "epochal achievement" in the international arena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. He has stated, "I am the president of peace and not the president of war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This desire could potentially stem from a hope for recognition, such as the Nobel Peace Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

Despite his significant powers as US president, Trump's authority is not absolute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. He is not a dictator and must contend with:
*   **Congressional officials:** Even within his own Republican party, officials may have different views on the [[Military and strategic implications in Russia Ukraine conflict | confrontation between Russia and Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Key positions like Secretary of State and Assistant to the President for National Security are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **The "Deep State":** The Washington bureaucracy, as seen in his first term, can block initiatives deemed detrimental to US interests or its international role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This "Deep State" continues to exist and can influence decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

Trump possesses the potential as president of the most powerful country to influence and exert pressure on both sides of the [[russia_and_ukraine_conflict_dynamics | conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. However, the details of how to negotiate peace are complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Summary of Trump's Approach
> Trump's economic-centric foreign policy creates a strong incentive for him to pursue peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. He aims to be a "peacemaker" who ends prolonged bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, marking his presidency with a significant international achievement. However, the implementation of his peace initiatives will face challenges from domestic political structures and differing views within his own administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

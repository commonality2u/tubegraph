The revision of pension amounts is considered "impossible and embarrassing" to observe, particularly given how pensioners contributed to the "Great Power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This issue is expected to be addressed by a [[internal_reforms_and_future_of_russian_governance | new government]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## Necessary Actions for Reform

According to one perspective, a new government would need to undertake several key steps to address the pension system:
*   **Cancel Retirement Age Increase** The increase in the retirement age should be cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Provide Compensation** Those who suffered losses due to the increased retirement age should receive compensation for the benefits they did not receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Increase Pensions** Pensions should be increased by reducing "non-productive expenses," the nature of which is generally known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Challenges to Radical Pension Increases

Despite the need for increases, a radical surge in pension sizes (e.g., 2-3 times) is deemed unlikely in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. While pensions can be made more "decent" and less "offensive," a substantial increase requires a fundamental [[political_and_social_reforms_in_russia | reform of the pension system]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

It is noted that what was previously termed "pension reform" in Russia was merely an increase in the retirement age, rather than a genuine reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. A true reform must still be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

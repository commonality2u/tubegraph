Valery Soloviev, Doctor of Historical Sciences, political analyst, and public figure, extended congratulations to Orthodox Christians on the holiday of bright Easter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This greeting marked the beginning of the eighth episode of his program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Hypothetical Visit of Jesus to Modern Moscow

Soloviev engaged in a thought experiment, inviting Christians and all viewers to imagine the Son of God visiting modern-day Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. He pondered how long Jesus would be able to preach the truth and the Gospel in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

Soloviev concluded that such a visit would be "very, very short" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Jesus would be arrested instantly, without needing to wait for a Sanhedrin meeting or complaints from priests or Pharisees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The immediate arrest would be due to violating two fundamental laws of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>:

1.  **Ban on unauthorized public events**: Any event in Russia can be deemed unauthorized by a court decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
2.  **Law on "fakes" against the Russian Armed Forces**: If Jesus were in Moscow, he would likely repeat the Sixth Commandment, "Do not kill" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. In Russia, this commandment is currently "banned" in a literal sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Displaying a poster with "Do not kill" in any Russian city would lead to immediate detention and accusation of spreading "fakes" against the armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Soloviev sarcastically suggested the State Duma might soon demand changes to the text of Holy Scripture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. He added that Christ, while not crucified today, would "definitely be given a ten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### The "Medical Accurate Description" of Russian Reality

Soloviev describes the current situation as a "medical accurate description of Russian reality," emphasizing "clinical madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. He asserts that medical language is the most appropriate for describing what is happening in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

#### Law on Foreign Agents

The new version of the law on "foreign agents" exemplifies this "madness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Old version**: Accused those who received financial aid from abroad for "agent activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Even a small transfer could lead to being declared an agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **New version**: Anyone "under foreign influence" can be deemed a "foreign agent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This includes using foreign languages for education, professional purposes, entertainment, or travel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Potentially, almost every citizen of the [[Russian National Identity and Patriotism | Russian Federation]] could become a "foreign agent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

A new category, "family members and agents," is expected to appear in the bill, reminiscent of the Stalinist formulation "families of traitors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Soloviev notes that history repeats itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Roots of the "Madness"

The increasing "clinical madness" is rooted in the current military-political reality, specifically the "special military operation" in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The military-political goals of this operation are becoming increasingly difficult to achieve, with the dynamics trending downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. The "Victory" sought by the Kremlin, particularly by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, is described as a "ghost in some blue distance," dissolving like a Fata Morgana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

#### Blaming "Enemies of the People"

Since the Supreme Commander-in-Chief (Putin) cannot be blamed—akin to "comrade Stalin is never wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>—the blame is shifted to others or circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This is an "anthropological pattern" more strongly expressed in the [[Russian National Identity and Patriotism | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

From the perspective of those who initiate laws, the "enemies of the people" are to blame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. President Putin stated that the West's primary task is to "split Russian society [and] destroy the country from within" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Fakes and calls for illegal actions are often organized from abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

This leads to understanding "enemies of the people" in the modern context as those associated with the West, who undermine stability and moral-political unity of Russian society with foreign support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

Two categories of "enemies" have emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>:
1.  **Foreign agents**: Cause information damage by spreading fakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
2.  **Outright terrorists and saboteurs**: The second category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Historical Analogies and Repeating Tragedies

The current situation combines experiences from two historical eras:

#### 1. Weimar Germany (1920s-1930s)

The first experience is borrowed from Germany before Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. In Weimar Germany, there was a popular argument that Germany lost World War I due to a "stab in the back" by "moral decay and national traitors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This phrase originated from Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

In modern Russia, "foreign agents" are seen as these "moral decay traitors" trying to "stick a knife in the back of society" and the armed forces through "fakes and decomposition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. The definition of who can be considered a "traitor" or "foreign agent" is becoming incredibly broad, potentially including anyone with an "insufficiently enthusiastic" or "overly critical facial expression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. An example is given of a person fined in Siberia for expressing "approval" of a peace action with their "facial expression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

#### 2. Stalin's Russia (1930s)

The second experience refers to the Stalin era, specifically the idea of opposition leading to direct terrorist activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. This concept shaped the infamous Moscow trials of 1936-1938 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Defendants allegedly admitted to killing Soviet figures and planning Stalin's assassination on instructions from foreign intelligence agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

A parallel is drawn between these historical trials and a recent report by President Putin in 2022, claiming a group of "neo-Nazis" preparing to murder TV presenter Vladimir Solovyov was captured and neutralized on instructions from Ukrainian security services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. Soloviev notes this as a "roll call of eras," albeit with a "lower pipe" and "thinner smoke" compared to the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

### Future Outlook

Based on this logic, the next step is expected to be the organization of public trials in Russia for "foreign agents" who have transitioned to "terrorist activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. The Prosecutor General reported millions of fakes disseminated with the support of foreign non-governmental organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>, and this number is expected to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.

Soloviev believes Russia is a country where "one historical tragedy repeats itself as a second tragedy," rather than a farce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. He concludes that Russia is only at the beginning of this process, with the "peak of the fight against very moral Chechen terrorists" and the "peak of exposing national traitors to agents" still ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

Despite the difficulties for those who remain in Russia, especially those with moral sense, common sense, and dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, Soloviev offers a "ray of light": this period "will not last long" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. He urges mutual support, helping both neighbors and those further away, and supporting voices that defend human dignity, common sense, and ordinary moral values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. He ends with an affirmation of ultimate victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

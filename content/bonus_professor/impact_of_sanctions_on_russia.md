The European Union continues to introduce new sanctions against the Russian Federation, with the sixth package of sanctions focusing on Russian oil and oil products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Economic Impacts of Sanctions

In 2021, EU countries imported nearly 71 billion euros worth of oil and oil products from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. It is projected that almost 65 billion euros from this volume will be lost due to the new sanctions by the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

Despite these seemingly ominous figures for the [[economic_impacts_of_sanctions_on_russia|Russian economy]], social sphere, and defense complex, it is believed that the impact may not be as severe as it appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Russia might be able to compensate for losses in exports to Europe by redirecting at least 40% of its intended exports to China and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

Methods to bypass sanctions are already being considered, such as mixing Russian oil with other oil to change its formal origin (if a tanker contains only 49% Russian oil, it is no longer formally considered Russian) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. The refusal to insure tankers can also be circumvented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Given the high global oil prices, Russian exports are not expected to suffer significantly, at least initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

### Personal Sanctions and Elite Reaction

While the overall [[impact_of_economic_sanctions_on_russia|economic sanctions]] might be mitigated, [[sanctions_against_russian_oligarchs|personal sanctions]] are a significant source of irritation for the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. These sanctions target not only oligarchs but also their spouses and children, with the West demonstrating that bypassing them will be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Children of the elite complain about their inability to travel the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This irritation, however, is not expected to lead to a conspiracy or riot against Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

### Future Economic Outlook

Experts suggest that sanctions will certainly have an effect, but they may not be "deadly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. However, officials and businessmen integrated into the real [[economic_impacts_of_sanctions_on_russia|economy]] anticipate serious problems, identifying August as a "fatal month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. They cannot verbalize the exact nature of these problems but feel that the end of summer could be "extremely alarming and even unpleasant" in financial and economic terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. They suspect a problem primarily in the financial sphere, possibly a powerful cyber attack on the banking system or an international economic crisis affecting Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

## Broader Systemic Impacts

Beyond direct [[economic_impacts_of_sanctions_on_russia|economic impacts]], the belief among high-echelon Moscow officials that Putin will eventually have to leave is now commonplace, extending even to the middle layer of federal bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. This uncertainty regarding leadership and the future of the "Putin's system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> is causing disorganization within the administrative apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Officials are questioning whether it is worth taking risks when the leadership structure is expected to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the administrative decline seen in Soviet offices during 1990-1991 due to uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

There is a sense of an approaching transitional moment and a turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. Officials are focused on their personal and group tasks, and some may be preparing for a "last grab" given the uncertainty of their positions and access to resources after changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.

The speaker believes that the "Putin system" is impossible without Putin himself and that its core will weaken and begin to fall apart without him, not taking decades or even years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

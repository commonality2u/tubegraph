The COVID-19 pandemic and the associated government responses have had significant and multifaceted impacts on Russian society and its economy.

## Economic Challenges and Government Response

The Russian economy has faced substantial challenges, with criticism directed at the government's handling of the crisis. There is a prevailing sentiment that authorities are struggling to implement effective policies, partly due to a lack of a clear power vertical within the country, where everything is executed "neither shaky nor shaky" and people look away [00:01:49].

One proposed measure to stimulate the economy was President Vladimir Putin's declaration of the need to issue citizens mortgages at 6.5% per annum [00:08:36]. However, experts raised concerns about the feasibility of such lending given the instability of the national currency, which has collapsed by 30% [00:09:28]. Major banks, including Sberbank, have not yet begun accepting applications for these loans, indicating a disconnect between presidential directives and practical implementation [00:30:18]. The will of the president does not seem to translate into action, as banks are unwilling to undertake unprofitable ventures [00:11:13].

Business owners have also voiced concerns about the lack of government support. Comparisons are drawn to other countries, like the US, where citizens received direct financial aid, while Russian businesses were only promised assistance after quarantine [00:12:34]. The government is perceived as trying to find ways to avoid paying budget money for support measures [00:09:59].

A significant concern is the financial stability of the population. An estimated 60-65% of Russian families reportedly did not have enough money to last even one month [00:36:03]. This suggests that extending self-isolation beyond April would be economically devastating for many [00:35:53].

## Societal Impacts and Public Perception

The pandemic has created a climate of uncertainty and distrust among the population. A significant portion of respondents (30%) believe that authorities are concealing the true picture of the epidemic in Russia by underestimating infection and death data [00:17:09]. Another 28% believe the threat is being exaggerated and used by authorities to cover up their own "sins and affairs" [00:17:59]. Conversely, about 30% believe the official data is correct and reliable [00:17:23].

Measures implemented, such as the pass system in Moscow, have been widely criticized for their chaotic and ineffective implementation. The widely announced system led to long queues at metro entrances and traffic jams, only for independent bloggers to find no traffic police present the next day [00:13:22]. This demonstrates a lack of understanding of basic logistics from management [00:13:56].

The implementation of isolation measures has led to increased instances of police violence, which, while always present in Russia, has become "particularly cynical" in this context [00:21:25]. Citizens have been fined for simply being outside, such as a grandmother in Mordovia fined 500 rubles [00:12:07].

There is growing irritation due to poorly executed policies and perceived government indifference. Propaganda efforts, such as billboards detailing business support measures that aren't actually working, are expected to cause further public irritation [00:31:40]. Displays in the Moscow metro encouraging people to stay home and devote time to family are met with the unspoken question: "With what money are you sitting?" [00:32:05].

## Impact on Business and Unemployment

The economic lockdown has severely affected businesses, especially small and medium enterprises. The closure of cafes, restaurants, fitness centers, and shops has turned city centers into a "cemetery" of illuminated signs with no people inside, as businesses become immobilized and face non-payment for loans and taxes [00:35:05].

Construction sites were initially closed, drawing sharp criticism from major developers like Aras Agalarov of Crocus City Hall. He warned of consequences for both the epidemic situation among workers and potential criminal issues if migrant workers, housed in poor conditions, were effectively imprisoned [00:23:55]. Agalarov was advised to show humanism by sending migrants home at his own expense, highlighting that their numbers are "not only excessive but extremely dangerous" [00:25:46]. The return of migrant workers would create job opportunities for Russian citizens [00:25:33].

Unemployment is a major concern. The number of unemployed in Moscow is estimated to be around half a million, and these estimates do not even include migrants [00:38:00]. This situation is leading to potentially grave consequences for the financial and banking sector [00:37:50].

## Political Landscape and Future Prospects

Sociological data indicating negative public moods are alarming for the authorities [00:18:54]. There are concerns that holding elections or a plebiscite on the constitution this fall would be "suicidal" given the prevailing mass sentiment [00:19:15]. This mood, coupled with an expected worsening of the [[the_economic_situation_in_russia_and_its_future_prospects | economic situation]] in the autumn, makes mass behavior unpredictable [00:19:19].

Rumors suggest that the Kremlin is preparing a block of political reforms, including the potential cancellation of gubernatorial elections starting this fall and the removal of about 20 governors, some of whom may face prison [00:26:42]. This information, while partly fabricated for manipulation, does reflect real discussions within the government about the risks of holding elections in September [00:27:46].

While society shows sharp increases in aggressiveness and irritation, it is not yet ready for mass demonstrations [00:39:06]. Local conflicts and deviant behavior are expected [00:39:16]. The authorities may be forced to partially unblock economic activity, especially in the provinces, to mitigate this [00:39:26]. The expectation is that major problems will arise in the fall, not in May, as society is not yet ready to challenge the state [00:39:36].

The long-term impact on society is expected to be severe, with significant unemployment and instability in the financial and banking sectors [00:37:43]. The current situation is seen as a matter of "physical existence" for the nation [00:33:43]. There is a call for the resignation of the president and government and the formation of a government of national salvation, to be achieved through protests on streets and squares, rather than elections [00:43:36].

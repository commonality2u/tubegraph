The presence and influence of [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | occultism and magical practices]] in Russian politics have seen a significant increase, particularly among the elite, and are often connected to President Vladimir Putin's personal [[role_of_mysticism_and_esotericism_in_the_kremlin | mystical and esoteric interests]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This trend is driven by a desire to overcome fear, prolong life, and gain political advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Elite Engagement with Occultism

There is a growing trend among the Russian elite and establishment to engage in various [[occult_rites_and_political_synchronization_in_russia | occult rites and political synchronization]] practices. This is perceived as a "fashionable" direction, with individuals seeking out exotic cults, beliefs, or fashionable shamans and fortune tellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. This demand for esotericism and occultism has been growing steadily since 2014-2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

### Pyramid Construction

Reports indicate that pyramids are being constructed in various locations across Russia, notably near Tomsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. These structures are built by groups of businessmen, some potentially linked to Yevgeny Prigozhin, with the architect Valery Uvarov, known for designing a spa salon owned by Prigozhin's spouse, involved in their creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The construction near Tomsk is symptomatic of the Egyptian motif that has "engulfed" the [[influence_of_occultism_on_political_figures | occult hobbies of the Russian elite]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

The choice of Tomsk for pyramid construction is linked to an archaeological expedition in the late 1980s that discovered Bronze Age graves with Egyptian cultural artifacts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Pyramids are often associated with tombs, suggesting a desire for someone to be "buried" there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Alternatively, in the context of Russian "black ideas" about pyramids, they are endowed with mystical power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. A conceptual "pyramid of power" would place a political subject at the top, former party workers as "shamans" in the middle, and folk doctors at the bottom to prolong life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### Putin's Personal Mystical Pursuits

Putin's engagement with occult practices includes:
*   **Non-Christian Rites:** In April of a recent year, Putin reportedly performed "very strange non-Christian rites" with an elder known as "Nikifor" (a pseudonym) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. These rituals were for Putin's health, salvation, and protection, as well as for "inducing damage" and "evil" upon his enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Such practices are not accepted within Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Fortune Tellers and Predictions:** Early in his management, Putin consulted three fortune tellers, two of whom were outside Russia, to learn about his future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. All three gave almost identical predictions: he would rule for 20 years as a "king," but the end of his reign would be "terrible if he cannot change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. These predictions, though allegorical, were easily readable as references to Russian politics, including events in Georgia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Crucially, the endings of these predictions were withheld <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>, but contained phrases like "all twelve turn away from you" and "be afraid of part of the southern ruler of poisons husband of the state southern ruler head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

### Relics and the Santa Muerte Cult

The desire for "miracles" among the elite has led to the exploitation of human remains, similar to ancient religious cults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. Officials are willing to pay significant sums, up to 250-300 thousand American dollars, for remains believed to possess attributes of a miracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>.

A prominent example is the acquisition of a skeleton, designated as the remains of a "Byzantine king," which was intended to be used to arrange an altar for Santa Muerte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>. The Santa Muerte cult is a Mexican syncretic belief system combining elements of Christianity and traditional Mexican beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>. The altar's base requires a skeleton or skull, ideally belonging to a "powerful person" like a general, as the power of the relic reflects the status of the deceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. The cult has three varieties:
*   **Black Death:** For career growth and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>.
*   **Golden Death:** For becoming very rich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>.
*   **White Death:** For worldly goods like love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

This [[interplay_of_religion_and_occult_practices | cult is widespread]] in Mexico and northern South America, and its followers often participate in both Catholic practices and Santa Muerte rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. This dual practice, where religious adherence coexists with occult rituals, is noted to be similar among some of the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.

### Shamans and Other Practices

The elite's pursuit of mystical solutions extends to shamans. After exhausting options like shamans from Khakassia, Tuva, and the Altai Mountains, they began to turn to shamans from the Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>. These are often "magicians" supplied through intermediaries, who might even brief the shamans on what the client wants to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:35">[00:41:35]</a>. Some are also known to use psychotropic drugs, referred to as "amplifiers of mental processes," for rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:43">[00:41:43]</a>.

A notable example is Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the former head of Kalmykia, who publicly recounted an experience of being abducted by aliens in a "translucent pipe" and touring their spaceship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>. This story, confirmed by "three witnesses" (his driver, minister, and assistant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>, illustrates the extreme nature of some beliefs. This belief in the "cult of Sirius" is reportedly shared by many beyond Ilyumzhinov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.

## Reasons for the Occult Surge

The surge in [[role_of_mysticism_and_esotericism_in_the_kremlin | mysticism and esotericism in the Kremlin]] and among the elite is attributed to several factors:
*   **Fear of Putin's Mortality:** The discussion around Putin's upcoming 68th birthday and "fear of his death" drives the search for ways to "domesticate this fear" and prolong life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Loss of Luck:** There's a widespread feeling among the elite that Putin has lost his "luck" or "mystical belief" in his fortune, especially since August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. This perceived loss of luck, coupled with his increasing isolation, creates nervousness and even "semi-panic" among those who traditionally had access to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
*   **Inability to Change Reality:** The elite finds that traditional political and economic instruments are no longer effective in changing reality, leading them to turn to "magical instruments" they believe can achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.
*   **The "New Middle Ages":** The current situation in Russia is characterized as a "new Middle Ages," where people are poisoned, and the government engages in "dense black magic rituals" and "worships the remains of the dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. This belief in a world governed by hidden forces or a "world government" drives the search for influential "secret chancery" or "competing chanceries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.
*   **Imitation of the Leader:** The leader's personal interests in the occult influence others to adopt similar practices, creating a "fashion" where people seek to "stylize" themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. This creates a form of "team building" and group identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>.

## Relationship with World Occult Orders

The Kremlin is believed to have no current contacts with "13 great world occult orders" due to "insurmountable contradictions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a>. This conflict reportedly stems from an "unsuccessful joke" or insult perceived by the grand master of these orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a>.

These organizations operate as non-public entities, influencing politics through their adherents and supporters, including those within the Russian government and Western governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>. They are described as "political subjects" who pursue goals through non-public means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:34">[00:58:34]</a>.

The core tenets of these 13 world occult orders are based on freedom, enlightenment, and uncensored knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. These principles are "completely rejected" by the Russian establishment, which prioritizes "spiritual bonds" and hierarchical control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:05">[01:02:05]</a>.

## Historical Context and Implications

The current prevalence of mystical and pseudo-occult moods in Russia is described as "much worse" than during the end of the Russian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>. Almost every group within the establishment exhibits strong mystical moods, though each may have its own "fashion" or "passion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.

This pervasive fear and demand for miracles stem from the profound turbulence within Russia, leading to a sense of hopelessness and lack of prospects for society, and "deep nothingness" for the establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. The elite is described as "thirsty for a miracle," desiring Putin to leave while everything remains unchanged, an impossibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>. This period is seen as a "new Middle Ages" where irrational beliefs and practices are rampant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

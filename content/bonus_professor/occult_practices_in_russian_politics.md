This article explores the growing role of [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | occult]] and magical practices within the [[russian_political_climate | Russian political climate]] and among its elite, drawing insights from a broadcast titled "Occult Warriors of the Kremlin." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

## The Case of Shaman Alexander Gabyshev

The discussion begins with the case of Alexander Gabyshev, a self-proclaimed shaman who was forcibly sent to a psychiatric hospital by court order for compulsory psychiatric care and medication. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> This action is seen as more than just political repression; it has a significant [[influence_of_occultism_in_russian_politics | magical]] or [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | occult]] dimension. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>

Valery Solovey states that there was a direct order from the President of the Russian Federation to "stab the shaman with drugs" and render him a "state of vegetables" or force him to cease all socially significant initiatives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> This order came just days after Gabyshev announced he had performed a ritual to "drive out evil spirits from the Kremlin." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a> Although no one witnessed the ritual, the announcement itself triggered this reaction from the authorities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>

### The "Stolen Soul" Ritual Explained

Andrey Soloviev, a philosopher, explains that Gabyshev belongs to a cultural type of shamans whose worldview is based on mythology and folklore. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a> The "rite of the stolen soul" is specific to the Siberian-Mongolian cultural group. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a> In this ritual, a demon steals a person's soul, and the shaman journeys to fight the demon and return the soul. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a> A critical detail is that the person whose soul was stolen *must* participate in the ritual; it cannot be performed remotely. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a> Therefore, according to traditional understanding, the ritual Gabyshev described could not have affected Putin as he did not participate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>

Andrey asserts that Gabyshev's activities are benign when compared to "sinister and bloody cults" like Vodou or the practices of "13 world [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | occult]] orders." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>

### Criticism of Psychiatric Repression

Natalia Petrovna Bekhtereva, a renowned neurophysiologist, stated that "the use of psychiatry for punitive purposes is an evil which gives rise to even greater evil with destructive consequences both for a person and for society as a whole." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a> Andrey questions the basis for declaring Gabyshev dangerous to society or himself, noting he has not committed violence or self-harm. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a> He concludes that Gabyshev is an "ordinary person" with a different worldview, likening him to Don Quixote. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>

## Historical and Contemporary [[influence_of_occult_practices_in_russian_politics | Occult Interests in Russian Politics]]

The fascination with [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | occult]] matters among the Russian elite is deeply rooted. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>

### From Predictions to Influence

Interest in the [[occult]] began around the early 2000s, fueled by the abilities of certain individuals who made predictions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a> A significant "hit" for the Russian President was linked to such a person; while this person was alive, "everything was going great." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a> After this person's natural death, things began to decline. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>

There remained an "imprinting" and a "thirst for wisdom," a search for a "miracle," and a "ring of omnipotence." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> This search is particularly characteristic of the Chekists (security services) since the 1920s. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a> Initially, this search explored Orthodoxy, partly due to fashion and partly as an attempt to find identity and an instrument of power. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a> However, it was quickly realized that Orthodoxy could not provide what these people needed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>

By the early 2010s, they increasingly turned to other practices, including Eastern esotericism. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a> This evolved from merely looking into the future to actively influencing it, especially from 2014 onwards, as the future began to unfold unexpectedly.<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>

Valery Solovey states with certainty that these practices seriously affect the decision-making process within the Russian government. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a> He mentions the "nooscope" idea, a quasi-rational attempt to explain magical abilities or look into the future, essentially a "crystal ball." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>

### Reasons for Elite's [[mystical_beliefs_among_russian_elite | Mystical Beliefs]]

The current [[russian_political_climate | Russian political climate]] shows an extreme mental instability among the elite. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>
> "You occupy the positions of the ruling elite, before that you were boyars, Malbork about outside the Komi colonels, translators from different languages, these are average template KGB USSR even the average, you have horror before what happened to you, you are not for unknown reasons, for unknown to you yourself, suddenly found yourself at the top." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>

This sudden, unexplained rise to power leads to a search for rationalization, a need to believe they are "chosen by higher powers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a> This belief is further fueled by the constant flattery and praise they receive. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a> They then seek guidance from these "higher powers" through intermediaries or "operators" to solve complex problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a> While 99% of these intermediaries may be charlatans, a tiny fraction, like Rasputin, may possess genuine abilities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>

> [!INFO] Historical Context: Rasputin
> Rasputin, at the court of Tsar Nicholas II, was not only seen as the savior of the Tsarevich but also played a role in appointing ministers, signifying the [[influence_of_occultism_in_russian_politics | authority's reliance on magical help]] when feeling helpless against "evil fate." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>

Valery Solovey argues that the current situation in Russia, concerning the elite's [[influence_of_occult_practices_in_russian_politics | occult]] involvement, is incomparable to anything in Russian history, even surpassing the "rationality and Voltairean skepticism" of the early 20th century or the Nazi Ahnenerbe. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a> He dismisses the idea of Hitler being a skeptic in this context, mentioning that Himmler, who was obsessed with the [[occult]], was tolerated by Hitler due to his loyalty. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>

The Soviet security officers also sought the "ring of omnipotence" and experimented with parapsychology and psychics, with Americans later borrowing this experience from the KGB. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>

## Contemporary [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | Occult Practices]] Among the Elite

The [[mystical_beliefs_among_russian_elite | Russian elite]] are drawn to [[occult]] services, often paying "colossal money" for them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a> These practices are facilitated by "conductors" or experienced "operators" who claim to enable experiences. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>

### Drug-Induced "Flights"

One prevalent form involves drug-induced "flights" or hallucinations, using naturally growing alkaloids from Russian territory like atropine, psilocybin, and mushrooms. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>
*   **"Flights to Nibiru":** Based on a mix of intercontinental myths (Mesopotamia, Central America, India, China) with a "Reptiloid" as the main character, requiring a circle for the ritual. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>
*   **"Flights to Sirius":** Based on recycled Dogon mythology with "two heads and shoulders" as the main characters, requiring a triangle for the ritual. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>

These rituals induce vivid hallucinations, providing "gorgeous satisfaction" and perceived answers to questions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a> However, the use of these alkaloids artificially increases serotonin levels, leading to a "failure of certain thought processes" and "schizophrenia." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a> Participants develop an addiction, leading to a "rapid personal transformation of degradation" and living in a "shifted reality." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a> This is particularly concerning as these individuals make significant political and financial decisions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>

### Blood Rituals and Sacrifices

The role of "gloomy" and "ominous" rituals is growing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a> The elite are actively buying ancient grimoires (books of magic) from Europe, specifically seeking originals, believing they possess special power. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:36">[00:37:36]</a> These rituals, often conducted by "operators," are a "colossal business." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a> The aim is not prediction but to influence the future, gain invulnerability, and engage in an "occult war." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:28">[00:39:28]</a> Some within the elite believe they have entered into an "occult conflict" with "two or three very powerful orders." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>

Two specific practices popular in Moscow are mentioned:

#### Palo (Vodou)
This cult, originating from the Bantu people and transformed in the Caribbean basin and Brazil, involves dark rituals for evil purposes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>
*   **Components:** A fresh corpse (preferably a maniac killer or suicide) and a wooden doll. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>
*   **Process:** The corpse is exhumed, cut into pieces, mixed with grave soil in a barrel, and live birds are placed on it to die in agony, cleansing the soil. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a> A doll, carved to resemble the intended victim, is soaked in a composition of human blood and plant juice. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a> The doll is buried in the grave soil with corpse parts, later exhumed, and then fed with the blood of a virgin and the sperm of men. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a> Iron objects are then driven into the doll during a ritual. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:24">[00:50:24]</a> One doll remains with the adepts, and the second is sent to the target. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a> The psychological impact on the recipient, if they believe, is key. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>

#### Santa Muerte (Holy Death)
This cult, created in Mexico, is also popular in Russia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>
*   **Components:** An ancient, decomposed human corpse (mummy) and a human skull. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:55">[00:51:55]</a>
*   **Process:** The mummy is exhumed, washed, rubbed with incense, adorned with a golden crown and jewels, and used in rituals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a> Followers of this cult consider it essential to have a human skull at home, specifically from an influential, high-ranking person. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a> The belief is that if you have a fool's skull, you will become a fool. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>

## The Traditional Church's Stance

The traditional Russian Orthodox Church has three strategies in relation to these non-traditional [[occult]] practices: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>
1.  Avoid, condemn, and deny them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:11">[00:55:11]</a>
2.  Treat them calmly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>
3.  Participate in them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>
Some members of the church participate, believing it is a "real path to power." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>

The [[mystical_beliefs_among_russian_elite | Russian elite]] is searching for a powerful force to help them, but they are finding it "not in Orthodoxy and in communication in Christianity." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a> While a decade ago, they tried to return to their Orthodox roots, in the last 5-6 years, they have been moving away from it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>

Andrey notes that the traditional church and occult practices now "get along quite well and peacefully." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a> He suggests that skepticism towards religious rites exists because of the historical influence of the State Security Committee (KGB) on the Russian Orthodox Church. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>

## [[moral_and_political_implications_for_russian_leadership | Implications for Russian Leadership]]

The authors contend that the [[putins_occult_interests_and_practices | Russian leadership]] and elite are living in a "shifted reality" due to their involvement in these practices, having "lost all their bearings." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a> This phenomenon is not limited to isolated individuals but occurs at a "group level," influencing even those who avoid it, forcing them to adapt to this "intra-corporate wall." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>

> "For us, it looks very strange, incomprehensible, monstrous, well, just incomprehensible and we express this in very strong categories, from the inside it is all very logical, it is all very consistent, it is all integral, but it is all based on completely strange, very softly I say parcels." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>

The [[criticism_and_societal_perceptions_of_occultism_in_russia | public exposure]] of these practices is seen as unacceptable by those involved. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:19">[00:59:19]</a> However, signs of these [[influence_of_occult_practices_in_russian_politics | occult]] activities can be detected in public life and the behavior of the highest elite, indicating a serious underlying basis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a>

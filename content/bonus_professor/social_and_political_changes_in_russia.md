On May 15, political analyst Valery Solovey reviewed the military-political week, noting a concerning trend in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Military and Diplomatic Stalemate

The Kremlin has been unable to achieve a turning point in its "special military operation" in Ukraine in its favor, a fact evident to all uncommitted observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The chances of achieving a strategic turning point without the use of "extremely potent means" are diminishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This presents the Kremlin with a dilemma: either continue operations with little chance of success or attempt to negotiate with Ukraine through Western influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Russia is reportedly sending overt and covert signals to the West regarding conditions for negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. From the Kremlin's perspective, these initial goals for the operation have become "almost minimal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Kremlin's Proposed Conditions

The Kremlin's conditions for a peace treaty include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>:
*   Complete control of Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   Ukraine's recognition of Crimea as Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   Donbass being independent or, in the future, part of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   A land corridor to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Western Reaction to Negotiations

The West's reaction to Russia's overtures has been largely negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. A notable instance was a conversation between Russian Defense Minister Shoigu and US Defense Secretary Austin, the first since February 18, which was initiated at Russia's request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

There are differences in Western positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>:
*   France and possibly Germany would not object to Russia and Ukraine agreeing on such conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. French President Macron even suggested to Ukrainian President Zelensky that he make territorial concessions to Russia for a peace treaty, which Zelensky refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Germany's position is less clear, but it has delayed weapons supplies to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   The "Saxon bloc," including Great Britain, the United States, Poland, and the Baltic countries, supports Ukraine fighting "to a victorious end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Ukraine believes it can achieve decisive success and regain all its territory, not just restoring the pre-February 24 status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

The collective West desires a swift peace treaty, but Russia's leadership cannot appear to leave "empty-handed," as this would be an admission of defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The term "capitulation" has even appeared in the lexicon of Russian officials, which was previously unheard of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

The West also does not want an escalation of the conflict and has consistently communicated to Putin that it is not interested in its territorial expansion or qualitative escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Internal [[Sociopolitical changes in Russia | Russian Dynamics]]

In response to Ukraine's potential mobilization of up to a million people and anticipated counteroffensives, Russia has two remaining instruments: mobilization and the use of "qualitatively new weapons," specifically weapons of mass destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. A "hidden mobilization" is already underway in the Russian Federation, drawing from the reserve created in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. A public announcement of mass mobilization is anticipated only after Putin recovers from an upcoming operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Propaganda and Distraction

In the absence of successes on the Ukrainian fronts, Russia's Ministry of Defense issues "sensational news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This includes:
*   An announcement of an attempt to infect residents of the LPR with tuberculosis through fake bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This was likened to Soviet-era rumors about Americans poisoning chewing gum and cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   A report on Pentagon experiments in a psychiatric hospital in the Kharkov region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   Previous news about Ukrainian secret laboratories developing dangerous disease strains and studying migratory bird routes to spread them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

These types of news stories are launched loudly to grab attention but then die a "natural death," serving to "occupy the information public space" in the absence of other positive news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Economic Reality Versus Official Optimism

The official narrative, espoused by the president, claims Russia is "successfully overcoming sanctions" and that sanctions are "to our advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. The ruble is presented as demonstrating the "best dynamics among all currencies in the world," while the West faces problems like unemployment, inflation, and falling GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This optimistic economic analysis is compared to Soviet-era jokes about capitalism being on the edge of an abyss while socialism is "at the bottom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

However, behind this optimism, the reality is stark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>:
*   Bloomberg reports a forecast by the Ministry of Finance predicting a GDP fall of 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
*   Under a pessimistic scenario, Russia's isolation from world markets, especially oil sales, could lead to a decline of up to 25% over two years, an "unprecedented" decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   Even the predicted decline would be the largest in 94 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   All economic achievements and growth of the past 10 years are being nullified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.
*   Incomes are shrinking, and prices have increased significantly, despite some recent decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   Car sales in Russia in April collapsed by almost 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. AvtoVAZ is preparing to offer models from the early 90s due to the loss of imported automotive electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   Unemployment is a growing threat, with every fifth company initiating mass layoffs and another third considering it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

### [[Public opinion and political shifts in Russia | Societal and Political Implications]]

The speaker suggests that the current reality in Russia is "absolutely unbearable" if perceived as it is, leading to an increase in unbalanced behavior among people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

A key aspect of [[Political change and dictatorship in Russia | sociopolitical changes in Russia]] is the attempt to compensate for deteriorating social situations, declining incomes, and lack of economic prospects with "injections of optimism" and "patriotism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This includes:
*   Introducing history lessons from the first grade, which is described as transforming history into memorizing dates and facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.
*   Restoring the All-Union Pioneer Organization on May 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

The government is described as trying to move forward with its head "turned back 180 degrees," looking for future examples in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. An increase in rhetoric about patriotism and calls for patience directly correlates with worsening real conditions in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. This "state-owned" patriotism, which tells people to "live worse because such is our fate," evokes "rejection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

On the political front, five governors were removed last week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. They were "ordered" to leave, as high-ranking officials in Russia resign only by order of the supreme leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. These removed governors are considered "lucky" because they will not be held accountable for the deteriorating situation, a position that has become "frankly shot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>. Further removals, and possibly criminal cases, are anticipated for other officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

The speaker concludes that the past week looked "phantasmagoric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>, describing it as a "great regret for all of us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. He encourages viewers to help each other and those in Russia who protect human dignity, common sense, and moral values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:29">[00:19:29]</a>. Despite the difficulties, he affirms that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.

This article discusses recent developments in Russian politics and military actions, distinguishing between "information reasons" (or noise) and "events" that genuinely impact the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Information Noise and Presidential Appearances

The past week has been characterized by significant "information noise" or "information garbage," primarily produced by the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Examples include speeches in Ulan-Ude, before the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and alleged trips to Crimea and Mariupol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Use of Doubles

It is stated that in most of these "information events," a double of Vladimir Putin was the key figure, specifically for appearances in Ulan-Ude, at the helicopter plant, in Crimea, and during a night trip to Mariupol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The use of Putin's doubles is widely acknowledged abroad and no longer doubted in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

Vladimir Putin himself only appeared in person before businessmen, industrialists, and entrepreneurs at the House of Music, as many attendees know him personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. His appearance was described as being "on speed" or "very strong stimulants," which "revived" his mental activity but "not in the right direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. These "information reasons" did not affect the real situation in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Putin as a "Toxic Asset"

After Putin's speech to industrialists and entrepreneurs, many left "extremely disappointed" due to a lack of answers to their concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Furthermore, some very wealthy Russian individuals, described as "admirals of Russian business," did not attend the meeting to avoid falling under sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Previously, being close to Putin brought "material dividends," but now, the Russian elite avoids him, viewing him as a "toxic asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Significant Events

### Xi Jinping's Visit to Moscow

A major upcoming "event" is the visit of Xi Jinping to Moscow, which is expected to genuinely affect Russian domestic and potentially foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. China's goal in relation to Russia is to transform Russia into a weakened state, tied to China, rather than a strong one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. However, China does not desire an "absolute, complete defeat of Russia on the Ukrainian fronts," as it would be a "bad sign" for China, suggesting autocracies lose when confronting the consolidated West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. China's peace initiative is unlikely to succeed, as the US has stated its proposals are unacceptable, a position shared by Ukrainian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### International Criminal Court Warrant for Putin

A significant event that occurred recently is the issuance of a warrant by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for Vladimir Putin on suspicion of committing war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. While Russia, China, India, and the United States do not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction, the warrant itself has significantly influenced the situation in Russia and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

#### Impact of the ICC Warrant

The warrant's influence is seen in several aspects:
*   **Legally Symbolic**: It sets an important precedent, moving the persecution of high-ranking Russian officials from the political and propaganda spheres to the legal plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. Other Russian officials may follow Putin in facing such legal action, leading to increased apprehension among them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. The US is reportedly prepared to actively participate in organizing a trial for crimes in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
*   **Domestic Political**: Putin's status has shifted from a "guarantor of wealth and privileges" before February 24 to a "toxic asset" after, which the Russian elite desires to shed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. While the elite may show public solidarity, there are groups within it capable of "extremely decisive actions," whose desire and capability for such actions could "grow significantly" and "move into some practical plane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow could serve as a "trigger for certain actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   **International Political**: Putin is now perceived as a "leper" on the international stage, making many unwilling to communicate with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. The German Minister of Justice has stated that Putin would be arrested if he appeared on German territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. This marks a "cardinal change" in the atmosphere around the Russian president and the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.
*   **Putin's Mental State**: The warrant has driven Putin into a "deep depression," affecting his already suboptimal mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This increased risk of "unforeseen actions" or "dangerous decisions" is understood by his closest circle, who are now seriously considering an "extremely unpleasant" future that is "much closer than before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

## [[Mobilization process in Russia | Parallel Mobilization]]

A new stage of [[Mobilization process in Russia | mobilization]] has begun, described as "hidden, parallel, quiet, veiled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. Although the term "[[Mobilization process in Russia | mobilization]]" is not officially used, the process is ongoing in different forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

Individuals are being invited for document verification, which is happening in over 45 regions of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Summons for military training are also being issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. The military commissariat of Buryatia openly stated that "immobilization" did not stop because there was a decree for its beginning but no decree for its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. There are unconfirmed reports that graduates of Penza University will receive a military summons along with their diploma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

This [[Mobilization process in Russia | mobilization]] relies on a "system of influence" involving "blackmail, threats of violence, and promises" to compel people to go to the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>. People are enticed with offers of high salaries (e.g., 200,000 rubles a month) and promises of financial benefits, while also facing accusations of being unpatriotic if they refuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This combination of measures is expected to force a "considerable number of people" into the active army, as many are needed ahead of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, with targets of increasing numbers by 400,000 or more in the next one and a half to two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. The Kremlin reportedly believes there will be no protests on this basis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

## Economic Impact of the "Special Military Operation"

The "special military operation" has nullified 10 years of labor and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. Real incomes of Russians are 6.5% lower than in 2013, and the actual volume of goods consumption is 9.1% less than in 2013, which was the last measured peaceful year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. This represents "10 years down the drain" for the Russian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

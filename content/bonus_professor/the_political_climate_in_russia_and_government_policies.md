Valery Solovey, a Russian political scientist and Doctor of Historical Sciences, offers insights into the current [[political_situation_in_Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, detailing the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the [[economic_and_political_situation_in_Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, and shifts in public opinion.

## Putin's Leadership and Responsibility
Contrary to some Telegram channel rumors, Valery Solovey states that Vladimir Putin has not been removed from power and continues to control the levers of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. However, Putin avoids public appearances with bad news and defers responsibility for difficult decisions to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Moscow Mayor Sobyanin and regional governors have been tasked with implementing measures without sufficient resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

Solovey notes a significant shift in Putin's perception:
> He has always been considered a factor in stability... but now, for the first time in 20 years, I think, by and large, he has become a factor in destabilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Economic Challenges
Russia's economy is critically dependent on oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The budget is not as strong as official figures suggest, and government estimates indicate that current reserves may only last until October or November if the status quo is maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. There is an idea to lower the ruble exchange rate to 100 per dollar to make up for lost budget revenues, but Putin is currently holding it back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Oil Price Dispute (OPEC+)
The decision to withdraw from the OPEC+ deal was made by Putin, not Sechin, and its exact reasoning is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The refusal was offensive to Saudi Arabia, creating a strong personal conflict between Putin and the Saudi Crown Prince, who reportedly refused to speak with Putin on the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

[!NOTE] The Saudis allegedly received information that the Kremlin was involved in the scandal surrounding Jamal Khashoggi, disclosing and replicating information through agents and media in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The Kremlin's perceived logic was to create sanctions against Saudi Arabia and hostile attitudes from Europe, forcing the Saudis into Russia's arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. This information, possibly conveyed via Turkey, led to a "snake cublog" of a situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

Trump influenced the Crown Prince to resume talks, with Russia offering to leave Venezuela as a concession to the Americans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. Russia promised to stop supporting Maduro and evacuate him, potentially accepting him in Rostov or Saransk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. The Saudis demanded Russia reduce oil production twice as much as they do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. Solovey believes Russia is ready to agree to everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.

Even at $25 per barrel, Russia could make ends meet if it stopped "stealing on Homeric scales" and cut non-core expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. However, global economic growth is needed for high oil prices, which is unlikely; prices will likely remain in a low range through a significant part of next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

## Government Response to the Epidemic
The current legal status in Russia is undefined, termed "my charge," not a state of emergency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The Kremlin avoids declaring a state of emergency to evade financial and legal responsibility to society, unlike Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

The authorities are hiding the true scale of the epidemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Reported figures do not correspond to reality, and testing is insufficient, with only 6,000 tests daily in Moscow and none in some regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>. Doctors often use "pneumonia" as a cause of death to conceal COVID-19 fatalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

Import substitution is a "propaganda myth"; Russia's dependence on imports is very large, unable to produce even enough masks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>. The system is inefficient and falling apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Political Shifts
Putin's traditional electorate, who previously showed sympathy and believed he had no alternative, are now expressing "hatred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The government's failure to announce a broad assistance program for businesses and citizens has led to "unprecedented" despair and hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This will lead to a [[public_opinion_and_political_shifts_in_Russia]] in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Internal Political Dynamics
Moscow police officers, who were on vacation due to high morbidity, were urgently recalled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, with some expecting orders to "beat Muscovites" for being on the street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. However, Moscow is deserted, with people showing common sense or fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

The system is getting out of hand, with mass resignations among mid-level bureaucrats in several regions, particularly in the south of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>. They fear arrests and being punished as "innocent" or "uninvolved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:23">[00:42:23]</a>.

Moscow Mayor Sobyanin, promised the head of the State Council post for successful self-isolation implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>, faces opposition and has many ill-wishers among security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>. The proposed QR code surveillance system for Muscovites was technically unrealistic and unlikely to be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>.

One month of quarantine is predicted to cause a million unemployed in Moscow alone, and 9-10 million across Russia, roughly a tenth of the working population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:58">[00:37:58]</a>.

## Constitutional Changes
Putin initiated constitutional changes that did not make much sense and could not have been done in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>. The idea of renewing presidential terms caused strong irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. The entire procedure makes the constitution "completely illegitimate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>; any new government will likely ignore it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.

## Foreign Policy and International Relations
The planned May meeting of Western leaders in Moscow for Victory Day will naturally not happen, and the Victory Parade itself may be postponed to June 24 or September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

### Sanctions
While some in the State Duma suggest lifting sanctions due to the global crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:45">[00:30:45]</a>, it's unlikely they will be fully lifted. Trump promised not to tighten sanctions and might try to soften them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:23">[00:31:23]</a>. The EU, requiring consensus, is too preoccupied to discuss the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. Long-term, if global mutual assistance emerges and the [[political_and_economic_climate_in_Russia]] changes, sanctions might be lifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>.

### Ukraine
Russian intentions regarding Ukraine remain "absolutely unchanged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>. The Kremlin expects Ukraine to turn to it for help, potentially involving "military virologists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. Moscow was pleased with Yermak's behavior during the Oman meeting and hoped to use him as a "Sherpa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. However, the scandal involving Yermak's brother has caused dissatisfaction in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.

The Donbass is considered an important electoral resource, with a goal to issue one million Russian passports there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>.
> If Russia considers it necessary by force of one reason or another to put pressure on the Ukrainian leadership or to distract the attention of society from the problem in Russia, this moment when the crisis will unfold there will be a very great threat of the outbreak of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>.

Putin desires Trump to win the US elections and will try to help him, possibly by providing information on the Biden family's interest in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:42">[00:52:42]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Valery Solovey believes the [[political_and_economic_climate_in_Russia]] will undergo significant [[change_in_the_political_landscape_in_Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>. The [[russian_political_situation and governance issues]] as known for the last 20 years are beginning to collapse rapidly, potentially taking on an "avalanche-like character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>. The authorities will then be concerned with "survival and confrontation with domestic political image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:05">[00:34:05]</a>.

The current crisis is characterized by unpredictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. Solovey has a strong feeling that "no one will be in the final configuration" from among the current top officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>. He expects new people to appear in the political landscape, and parts of the ruling elite are already discussing agreeing on future positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.

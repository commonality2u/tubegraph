## Illegitimacy of Leadership

The President of Russia refers to the President of Ukraine as "illegitimate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Conversely, Mr. Zelensky has frequently asserted the "illegitimacy" of the Russian presidency based on an analysis of Russian presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. According to the speaker, the presidential elections in Russia were "initially illegal" because a double of the president won, making the elections illegitimate by definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. It is claimed that the actual vote count did not exceed 50%, and reported numbers were "lies and falsification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Propaganda and Public Perception

Russian propaganda is described as "imbued with... hatred of Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. To counter this, it would be necessary to switch off the "state propaganda machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. If this occurred, a significant portion of society would "come to its senses" within six months, aiming to change the country's climate from "malignant to benign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Status of Russian Leadership and the Conflict

The speaker asserts that the real Putin has been dead since at least October 26 of last year and is replaced by a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The head of [[international_military_assistance_to_ukraine | Ukrainian intelligence]], Budanov, also spoke of Putin's doubles a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

Despite the alleged death of the real Putin, [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | military actions]] do not stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. The current ruling elite is interested in continuing the [[russianukrainian_relations_and_military_tensions | military actions]] not for war itself, but for "peace on favorable terms" that would allow them to prolong and strengthen their power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:15">[00:30:15]</a>. This is seen as a matter of negotiating "deals" and "positions for concluding peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.

## Peace Negotiations and Sanctions

If a broad compromise with [[ukraine_conflict_and_nato_relations | Ukraine]] is not reached, with which [[ukraine_conflict_and_nato_relations | Ukraine]] itself agrees, a significant portion of sanctions will not be lifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. Existence under sanctions is considered possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

## Annexed Territories

Regarding the [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | Donbass]] and other "new territories" controlled by Russia, the speaker states that the attitude of the local population towards Russia is obvious if one trusts "common sense" and "universal human experience" instead of propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. If the Russian Federation retains these territories, sanctions will not be lifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.

## Public Opinion in Occupied Territories

The speaker believes that the attitude of people in the "so-called new territories" controlled by Russia towards Russia and Russians is negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. This assessment is based on "common sense" and "universal human experience," rather than propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>.

## Hybrid Warfare

An incident at the Belarusian border was not the "beginning of a hybrid operation" but rather a "test of the instruments of hybrid warfare" to "break the strength" of the West, specifically the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.

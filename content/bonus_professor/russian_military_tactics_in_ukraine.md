The Russian military has adopted new tactics during its special military operation in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Current Offensive Strategy
The offensive of Russian troops continues at a non-high pace, but they cannot be stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Fierce battles are ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation have switched to a strategy described as the "salami tactic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This involves gnawing off pieces of Ukrainian territory by achieving superiority in specific directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The key direction is currently not just Donbas, but specifically the Luhansk region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. As superiority is achieved and local tactical goals are met, superiority will then be established in other directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Effectiveness of Tactics
The "salami tactic" has been described as "quite successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

As of the program's recording, 20% of Ukrainian territory (one-fifth) is under the control of Russian armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This is a significant increase from February 23rd, when only 7% of Ukrainian territory, including Crimea, was under control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This represents an enormous distance of territory gained and is considered an operational and tactical success, though not a strategic one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Russian Definition of Peace
The Kremlin's understanding of a "peace agreement" differs significantly from European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. While European nations like France and Germany expect Russia to return its troops to their positions from February 24th, cease fire, and then make peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, the Kremlin interprets this differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

For Russia, "peace" means a break or a truce, specifically a ceasefire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Such a pause is extremely beneficial for the Kremlin as it provides time to regroup forces, bring in new contingents, and acquire military equipment, which is becoming increasingly scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The Kremlin is "categorically not interested" in returning troops to the pre-invasion status quo positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Therefore, any step by [[Ukraines military strategy and international support|Ukraine]] towards the Kremlin for a pause would exclusively benefit the Kremlin by providing a respite for redeployment and strengthening positions in currently controlled territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Resource Depletion and Integration of New Territories
The issue of resource exhaustion is becoming evident for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Signs of this include:
*   The abolition of the age limit for signing the first military contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   The un-mothballing of outdated T-62 tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   Allegations of forced round-ups of young people (18-27 years old) for military registration in places like Makhachkala, Dagestan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

Russia is preparing to integrate the "new territories" it controls into its composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The plan is to repeat what happened with the self-proclaimed republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>, with the intention to incorporate the Kherson and Zaporizhia regions directly into the Russian Federation, potentially through a referendum or without one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. This would legitimize a new territorial status beneficial to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

In these new territories, Russian mobile operators and large TV panels are appearing in places like Mariupol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. The focus is on "spiritual food" (brainwashing) rather than restoring housing or other material goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

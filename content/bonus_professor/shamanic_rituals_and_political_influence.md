## Introduction to the Discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>
The topic of "Occult Warriors of the Kremlin" was discussed on the Feigin Live channel, featuring political scientist Valery Solovey and philosopher Andrey. The conversation delved into the perceived influence of [[occult practices in Russian politics | occult practices]] on decision-making at the highest levels of Russian power, drawing parallels with historical instances and examining contemporary rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The Case of Alexander Gabyshev: The Yakut Shaman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>
The discussion began by revisiting the case of Alexander Gabyshev, a self-proclaimed [[shamanic_traditions_and_initiation_rituals | shaman]] from Yakutia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Following his march toward Moscow, Gabyshev was forcibly sent to a psychiatric hospital by court decision for compulsory psychiatric care and medication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This isolation is not seen merely as political repression, but as an attempt to control perceived "magical properties" and dangers associated with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Valery Solovey stated that the root cause of Gabyshev's detention was not primarily political but "magical" or "occult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. He claimed there was a direct order from the Russian President to "stab the shaman with drugs" to render him a "vegetable" or force him into private life, preventing any further "socially significant initiatives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This directive came just days after Gabyshev announced he had conducted a ritual to "drive out evil spirits from the Kremlin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The Russian leadership reportedly takes such events seriously, perceiving them through an occult-magical lens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Andrey, however, clarified the nature of the [[shamanic_traditions_and_initiation_rituals | shamanic rite]] Gabyshev claimed to perform. He explained that Gabyshev belongs to a "cultural type of shamans" whose worldview is based on mythology and folklore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The specific ritual, the "stolen soul," involves a shaman battling a demon to retrieve a person's soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Crucially, the person whose soul is stolen *must* participate in the ritual, which lasts no more than nine hours and cannot be performed remotely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. Since Putin did not participate, Gabyshev's ritual, from a genuine [[shamanic_traditions_and_initiation_rituals | shamanic]] perspective, would have had no effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Andrey dismissed Gabyshev's activities as naive compared to more sinister occult practices like voodoo or the [[role_of_mysticism_and_esotericism_in_the_kremlin | practices of world occult orders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

Andrey also criticized Gabyshev's psychiatric commitment, citing Natalia Bekhtereva's statement that punitive psychiatry creates "even greater evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. He argued that Gabyshev poses no real danger to society or himself, comparing him to Don Quixote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>.

## Historical Precedents and the "Ring of Omnipotence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>
The fascination with the occult in Russian power is portrayed as traditional. Rasputin's influence at the Romanov court is cited as a precursor, where he held political sway beyond just healing the Tsarevich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. This phenomenon suggests that authorities turn to "magical help" when feeling helpless against challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

Valery Solovey claims that modern Russia's engagement with the occult is far more pervasive and intense than anything seen at the turn of the 20th century or even in Nazi Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. The current elite's mental instability and uncertainty, especially their perceived lack of legitimacy in their positions, drives them to seek "rationalization" and validation from "higher powers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. They seek an "instrument of power" and the "ring of omnipotence," which they initially sought through Orthodoxy but quickly turned to other esoteric and occult practices by the early 2010s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

> "The search for the ring all the authorities first on the paths Orthodoxy well it was partly a tribute to fashion and partly an attempt to find a certain I would say identity and to feel for an instrument of power then in his carried that Orthodoxy Christianity is not capable despite the presence of elders there which supposedly cuts we got lost it is not capable of giving what these people need and very quickly already somewhere in well at the beginning of this decade they did not increasingly resort to other practices to turn their gaze to the other side the search was very wide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>

This search expanded to Eastern esotericism, with some individuals involved in these circles even informing figures like Pelevin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. Since around 2014, the focus shifted from merely predicting the future to actively influencing and changing it in a desired direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This involves "colossal business" and access to "operators" for rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.

The search for the "ring of omnipotence" dates back to Soviet security officers (Chekists) who engaged in experiments with parapsychologists and psychics. The US even reportedly borrowed experience from the KGB in studying parapsychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.

## Modern Occult Practices and Their Impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:29">[00:28:29]</a>
The current elite, including financial and political figures, are deeply involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:17">[00:42:17]</a>. The mental state of those who resort to these practices is described as one of "chaos in your head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.

### "Flights" and Alkaloids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>
Some practices involve hallucinogenic "flights" to other realms:
*   **Flights to Nibiru**: Based on intercontinental myths, involving a mix of Mesopotamian, Central American, Indian, and Chinese mythologies, with Reptiloids as main characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>. Requires a circle for the ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>.
*   **Flights to Sirius**: Based on recycled Dogon mythology, featuring "two heads and shoulders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>. Requires a triangle for the ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.

Both "flights" use local alkaloids such as atropine, hyoscyamine, and psilocybin mushrooms, with an experienced "conductor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:14">[00:31:14]</a>. The goal is to create "thought forms" and experience vivid, colourful hallucinations, leading to a sense of satisfaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. Repeated use of these natural alkaloids can lead to increased serotonin levels, causing thought process failures and potentially schizophrenia and "degradation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. Users will never admit the hallucinogenic nature of their experiences, claiming to have communicated with entities and received answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:41">[00:33:41]</a>. This is likened to the inebriated state in the Soviet film *The Irony of Fate* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.

These concepts are openly popularized on channels like Ren TV, which is reportedly financed by Kovalchuk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>.

### Darker Rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>
The pursuit of [[historical_and_contemporary_perspectives_on_black_magic | darker, more ominous rituals]] is increasing. Wealthy individuals actively buy antique grimoires at auctions, believing in the "special power" of originals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>. These practices involve "operational magic" with skilled operators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:19">[00:38:19]</a>.

> "If you take an interest in the dynamics of sales of antique literature in Europe suddenly with surprise learns that somewhere in the last decades a strange buyer from Russia has been actively buying all the grimoires at auctions but those that are still being actively received and you need exactly the original understands no copies because he believes that the original has a special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>

Two "bloodiest" and "most effective" practices prevalent in Moscow are:

1.  **Palo Mayombe (referred to as "water")**:
    *   Originating from the Bantu people and adapted in the Caribbean and Brazil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.
    *   For "evil" rituals, requires a fresh corpse (preferably a maniac killer or suicide victim) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.
    *   The adept dismembers the corpse, mixes parts with grave soil in a barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:14">[00:48:14]</a>.
    *   Live birds are placed on "copies" (presumably effigies) and allowed to die in agony, with blood flowing to "cleanse" the grave soil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>.
    *   Wooden dolls (40-50 cm, not rag dolls) are carved to resemble the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:52">[00:48:52]</a>.
    *   The figurines are soaked in a composition of human blood and plant juice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
    *   After four days, they are buried in the grave soil with corpse parts for six days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.
    *   Then, they are "fed" with the blood of a virgin and the sperm of men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
    *   Iron objects are driven into the dolls during the ritual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.
    *   One doll is kept by the adept, and the other is sent to the intended victim, relying on the psychological belief of the recipient for its effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>. An example of a high-ranking businessman receiving such a doll in 2019 was given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>.

2.  **Santa Muerte (referred to as "Santa March")**:
    *   Originating from Mexico, popular in Mexico and Honduras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>.
    *   Uses mummified, rotted corpses, which are washed, rubbed with incense, adorned with golden crowns and precious jewelry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:59">[00:51:59]</a>.
    *   Followers consider it necessary to have a human skull at home, specifically an ancient one (at least 50 years old) belonging to an influential person of high rank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:43">[00:52:43]</a>. The belief is that a fool's skull would make the owner a fool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
    *   It is considered "no less bloody" than Palo Mayombe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

## The Church's Stance and Sociopolitical Implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>
The traditional church in Russia employs three strategies regarding these non-traditional occult practices: avoidance/condemnation, calm acceptance, or participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:04">[00:55:04]</a>. Some within the church reportedly participate, believing it to be a true path to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>. This suggests an [[interplay_of_religion_and_occult_practices | increasing shift away from Orthodoxy]] within the elite, who seek a more powerful force to help them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>.

The hosts suggest that the elite's adherence to occult practices stems from their mental instability and uncertainty about their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>. This internal chaos leads them to seek external "masters of the house" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>. The phenomenon is viewed as a "colossal business" fueled by desperation and a belief in an [[occult_rites_and_political_synchronization_in_russia | occult war]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>. The reality of these practices is described as "gloomier, more sinister, and frightening" than previous forms of mysticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. The core issue is not just the rituals themselves, but the mental state of those involved, which becomes a "shifted reality" that governs their decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>. This behavior, though incomprehensible to outsiders, is internally logical and consistent for those immersed in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>.

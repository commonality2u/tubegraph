Valery Solovey recorded a program on Sunday, March 12th, and it was aired on Monday, March 13th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Among the main topics discussed was [[geopolitical_dynamics_involving_china_and_russia | China's role]] in the current geopolitical landscape involving Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Diplomatic Engagements and Russia's Hopes

Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly hoping for support from China, referring to it as Russia's "older brother" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Significant effort has been made to arrange a visit from Chinese comrades to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, and it appears that Comrade Xi has agreed to this visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Putin is seeking both symbolic and practical outcomes from this engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Symbolic Victory**: For Putin, the visit represents a symbolic political victory, demonstrating that Russia is "in business" and he is not in international isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Russia, however, can no longer claim superpower status, a designation currently held only by the United States and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Practical Outcome**: The primary practical hope is to receive weapons and ammunition from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## China's Stance on Weapon Supplies and Influence

Despite discussions on the matter, China has not supplied weapons or ammunition to the Russian Federation, a fact that has caused "frustration and strong indignation" among the Russian political leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. China does supply some dual-use products, but these are not considered purely military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The meeting is anticipated to take place before the end of March, though exact dates remain unconfirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

China's intentions are not to appease the "mania of the Russian leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, but rather to further its own interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. China's objective is for Russia to become a [[chinese_influence_on_russian_politics | sphere of interest and influence]] for its "Great Eastern Neighbor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This can only happen if Russia is sufficiently weakened during armed confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, which, from China's perspective, Russia already is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Therefore, from the Chinese point of view, it is necessary for Russia to move towards a peaceful trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Supplying arms to Russia would further antagonize relations between China and the United States, which are already complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## China's View on Russian Leadership

There are "deaf but well-founded rumors" that China views Vladimir Putin as a "toxic asset" for Russia and believes that the Russian leadership needs personnel renewal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The assessment is that Putin has led Russia into a "practically hopeless situation" and cannot achieve victory nor agree to peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This has led to suggestions that the Russian leadership should consider a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

It would be "very interesting" if Xi Jinping were to directly suggest to Putin during their meeting that it is "time for you to go on a well-deserved rest," though it's acknowledged this would not be said so directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. For the first time in the history of [[russias_political_and_economic_relations_with_china | Russian-Chinese relations]] under Putin, China has begun to doubt Putin's role as a guarantor of Russia's stability and his ability to safeguard China's interests in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. There are individuals who are reportedly ready to promise that they can better observe stability and China's interests than Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

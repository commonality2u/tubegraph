The internal and external reputation of Russia, as well as its [[russian_diplomacy_and_international_relations | international relations]], have been significantly impacted by recent events, including the military operation in Ukraine, domestic policies, and perceptions of its leadership.

## Reputational Events and Perceptions

### Theatrical Meeting with Servicemen's Families
A key reputational event was President Putin's meeting with mothers, widows, and wives of Russian servicemen involved in the special military operation in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This meeting was widely criticized for its "deliberately theatrical nature" and "lowest quality theatricality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Critics noted that participants were "specially selected" and followed a "strange scenario" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The president's casual remark, "And what would have been better if they had died from vodka or died in an accident," highlighted a perceived "complete lack of empathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This statement suggested a worldview where dying for the "Motherland" (interpreted as dying for Putin) is preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, positioning Putin as a "real priest of Thanatos" (death) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Isolation at the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) Summit
The CSTO summit, attended by Putin, was characterized by "negative success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan refused to sign the final declaration, signaling Armenia's likely departure from the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Other countries are also reportedly considering leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

Photographs from the summit notably showed a "noticeably greater" distance between Putin and other participants, suggesting they were "avoiding the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This perceived avoidance coincided with the European Parliament's resolution calling Russia a "terrorist state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Although this resolution lacks immediate practical consequences, it directly impacts Russia's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Other leaders reportedly feared reputational damage or potential economic sanctions if they were seen too closely with the leader of a "declared terrorist state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. This "instinctive reaction" demonstrates a shift among Russia's traditional allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## [[Geopolitical tensions and Russias international relationships | Geopolitical Tensions]] and Belarus

### Death of Vladimir Makei
The sudden death of Vladimir Makei, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, officially attributed to a heart attack, is believed by "reliable sources" to have been a murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Makei was reportedly "very successful negotiator" in establishing communication between the Belarusian leadership and Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. During these negotiations, Belarus hinted at a willingness to make "political concessions" and even suggested future changes towards democracy in both Russia and Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

His death is seen as a means to "block" this diplomatic track and a "black mark" sent to the Belarusian president, Alexander Lukashenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. It serves as a warning to those who might "refuse close brotherly embraces" with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. Despite Lukashenko's likely internal "hatred resentment" towards those preventing him from distancing himself from Russia, he is expected to react by "keeping a low profile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics and [[Public opinion and its impact on Russian political dynamics | Public Opinion]]

### Shifting Public Sentiment
Previous sociological surveys had indicated a "high and growing level of optimism" in Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. However, doubts arose, suggesting people might be providing "socially approved answers" or exhibiting "schizophrenia of consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. More recent data from the Public Opinion Fund shows a significant increase in "anxious mood" among Russians, from 49% to 56% in a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

### Sources of Information and Trust
The disparity in optimism and anxiety is linked to information sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. For optimists, the primary source is television, which portrays Russia as "rich [and] prosperous," overcoming enemies and confidently moving towards "complete final Victory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. However, television also fosters "psychosis" by emphasizing omnipresent enemies and "foreign agents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

A survey conducted by Otkritie Bank in autumn in cities with populations over 100,000 revealed:
*   Internet media: 48% trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>
*   Social networks and Telegram channels: 45% trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>
*   Television: 36% trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>

This marked a shift from an August Levada Center poll, which found 51% trust in television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This discrepancy is attributed to the urban focus of the Otkritie Bank poll (urban audiences are more susceptible to internet media) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a> and the events between the polls, specifically the "successful counteroffensive of the Ukrainian armed forces and partial mobilization," which increased "fear and anxiety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. Despite the shift, the internet space often still reflects the agenda set by television and state-controlled news aggregators like Yandex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

### Growing Discontent with Propaganda
A significant finding from the Otkritie Bank survey is that 54% of respondents named "public political talk shows" as their "least favorite television programs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. This indicates that people are "starting to get sick of this Propaganda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>, with growing "disgust" that could potentially lead to "hatred" and "aggression" towards those propagating such views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.

### Economic Hardship and Societal Implications
The economic situation further impacts public perception. According to Ramir, expenses on food and everyday goods for the average Russian household reached almost 48% of their budget in October, a 6.5% increase from a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This "record" means nearly half of the income is spent on "existing, namely, surviving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>, leaving little for entertainment, healthcare, or self-investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>. This is described as a "slave state" where people "work only to eat [and] pay off a mortgage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.

The current situation is summed up by the implicit slogan: "Live as a slave and die for the Russian president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. Many may not grasp the reality of their situation or are "afraid" to admit it, facing a "devaluation of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.

Rumours of an [[assassination_attempts_on_trump_and_putin | assassination attempt on President Putin]] began circulating in the first week of September, gaining traction closer to the end of that week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:03">[02:21:03]</a>. The information was initially shared by a "very famous or notorious telegram channel," known for its accuracy and reliability, and was subsequently picked up by various Western media outlets, including respectable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:09">[02:17:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:03">[02:20:03]</a>. Discussions about this event were reportedly happening in "Moscow living rooms" even before the Telegram channel's message was widely spread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:09">[02:13:09]</a>.

## Nature of the Attempt

While confirmed as an [[assassination_attempts_on_trump_and_putin | attempt]], it is described as not being a "fatal swing" intended to kill, but rather a "public warning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:06">[03:04:06]</a>. The nature of the incident remains unclear, but it involved Putin's motorcade finding itself in a "strange situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:06">[02:32:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:06">[02:36:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:06">[02:41:06]</a>.

## Possible Motivations and Context

The attempt is suggested to be a message from forces with "long arms" capable of reaching Putin, possibly hinting at "demands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:06">[03:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:06">[03:34:06]</a>. This incident is viewed within a broader context of growing sentiment among the Russian elite for Putin to "disappear somewhere" and take "all responsibility" for the ongoing "special military operation" and other negative developments in Russia over the past 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:06">[02:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:06">[02:14:06]</a>.

This desire for Putin's departure, or at least a transfer of power, is seen as one "radical option" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:06">[02:40:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:06">[02:42:06]</a>. The incident also occurs amid concerns about Putin's physical and mental state, which has been reportedly noted by many at recent international summits, and a perceived "physiological weakening" of the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:06">[01:51:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:06">[02:22:06]</a>. His security officers are said to be among the first to react to this perceived weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:06">[01:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:06">[02:22:06]</a>. The overall sentiment is that it is hardly surprising, given these factors, that an [[assassination_attempts_on_trump_and_putin | assassination attempt on Putin]] would occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:06">[02:46:06]</a>.

The possibility of a gradual, legalistic departure of [[vladimir_putins_alleged_death | Vladimir Putin's alleged death and replacement]], or his retirement from power, transferring supreme authority into other hands while he hopes to rule from "behind the scenes," is also discussed as an alternative scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:06">[02:42:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:06">[02:50:06]</a>. Knowledgeable sources suggest that a "personal council" or "state council" has already been formed, expected to begin work before the New Year, indicating [[potential_political_consequences_for_putin_and_russian_establishment | potential political consequences for Putin and Russian establishment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:06">[02:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:06">[02:09:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:06">[02:17:06]</a>.

The 25th episode of Valery Soloviev's program "What's Happening" covers topics including a purported [[assassination_attempts_on_political_figures_including_trump_and_putin | assassination attempt on President Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This event, described as "absolutely phenomenal," adds to the rapidly accelerating changes in Russia since February 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.

## Elite Sentiment and the Attempt
A growing sentiment among the Russian elite suggests a desire for [[speculation_on_putins_health_and_the_future_of_putinism | Vladimir Vladimirovich]] to "suddenly disappear somewhere," thereby taking responsibility for the "special military operation" and other negative developments in Russia over the past 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>. This feeling contributes to the view that an [[assassination_attempts_on_political_figures_including_trump_and_putin | assassination attempt on Putin]] should "hardly be so surprising" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>.

## Reporting and Nature of the Attempt
Information about the [[assassination_attempts_on_political_figures_including_trump_and_putin | assassination attempt]] was first made public by a "very famous or notorious telegram channel" known for its accuracy and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>. This information was subsequently picked up by various Western media outlets, including respectable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. Discussions about this event were reportedly happening in "Moscow living rooms" even before the telegram channel's announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Rumors circulating in the first week of September suggested something "absolutely stunning had happened" involving [[speculation_on_putins_health_and_the_future_of_putinism | Putin's]] motorcade finding itself in a "strange situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

It is emphasized that it was an "attempt," not a fatal one, and its nature was likely a "public warning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. The warning's origin is unclear, but it implies the existence of forces with "long arms" capable of penetrating [[speculation_on_putins_health_and_the_future_of_putinism | Putin's]] protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. This might suggest the presence of certain demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a>.

The possibility of [[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization|mobilization]] in the Russian Federation became a central topic around May 6 [00:00:18]. This discussion emerged as the special military operation entered a positional phase with little advancement [00:00:39].

## Current State of the Special Military Operation

The conflict is characterized by "positional skirmishes" and "stubborn battles for populated areas," without large-scale operations like tank breakthroughs or envelopments seen in 1943 [00:00:55]. Both Russia and Ukraine maintain intentions for a strategic turning point [00:01:17]. Ukraine's intention is supported by its Western allies, ensuring a continuous supply of military and technical resources [00:01:25].

Russian military policy initially aimed to exhaust Ukraine's resources and demoralize its society to force a peace treaty on Russia's terms [00:02:12]. However, these goals have not been achieved, and Ukraine's resources continue to flow in faster than Russia can deplete them [00:02:22].

Russia faces limited military resources, and no external assistance is expected [00:03:02]. There are significant questions regarding the moral and psychological state of the Russian Armed Forces and society [00:03:12]. The actual goals of the operation have been rewritten multiple times since its start [00:03:25]. Initially, the goal was the "denazification [00:03:38] demilitarization of Ukraine," implying complete political control and a change of power [00:03:39]. Currently, a more modest task is set: complete control of Donbas, the Azov coast (largely achieved), and potentially the Black Sea coast (not yet implemented) [00:03:49]. Some high-ranking Russian military leaders, including General Staff generals, doubt that even these limited military goals can be achieved [00:04:19].

## Potential Tools for a Strategic Turning Point

To achieve a strategic turning point, two main tools are considered from the Russian perspective:
*   Crushing Ukraine and its armed forces with "human mass" through [[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization|mobilization]] of human resources [00:04:41].
*   Inflicting tactical nuclear strikes on Ukraine [00:04:53].

## Discussion on [[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization|Mobilization]]

[[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization|Mobilization]] has been discussed and prepared for practically since the first day of the special military operation [00:05:11]. The Security Council, under Nikolai Patrushev, has reported to President Putin that from an organizational and technical standpoint, everything is ready for [[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization|mobilization]], and it is believed there will be no negative political consequences [00:05:20].

However, the speaker questions the accuracy of these reports, noting similar assurances before February 24 that a conflict with Ukraine was impossible and politically unprofitable for Putin [00:06:47]. The speaker emphasizes that Vladimir Putin's logic differs fundamentally from that of experts, and past events clearly demonstrate this [00:07:15].

### Decision and Implementation of [[mobilization_process_in_russia|Mobilization]]

A decision regarding [[mobilization_process_in_russia|mobilization]] has been made by the President of the Russian Federation [00:09:39]. However, it is not guaranteed to be implemented with 100% certainty, and the timing of its start remains unknown [00:09:46]. May 9 was discussed as an option but was not designated as the start date [00:11:22].

It is planned to [[mobilization_process_in_russia|mobilize]] about half a million people in several stages (3-4 stages), potentially ending after the first depending on the mass reaction [00:10:10].

Potential tools to encourage [[mobilization_process_in_russia|mobilization]] include:
*   Military registration and enlistment office employees visiting homes, targeting anyone with a military ID between 17 and 50 years old [00:10:25].
*   Blocking bank cards of those subject to [[mobilization_process_in_russia|mobilization]] [00:10:47].
*   Closing exit opportunities for those subject to [[mobilization_process_in_russia|mobilization]] who are abroad [00:10:56].

### Justification and Escalation

Before a public declaration of [[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization|mobilization]], events are expected that would justify the need for it from a propaganda perspective [00:11:33]. These events would aim to show that Ukraine poses an existential threat to the Russian Federation [00:11:47]. Examples of such events could include:
*   A chemical attack [00:12:03].
*   Terrorist attacks in large Russian cities, including Moscow and St. Petersburg [00:12:06].

Such actions would serve as a pretext to declare publicly that the "homeland is in danger," shifting the conflict's status from a "special military operation" to a "full-fledged and large-scale war" [00:12:26]. This change in status would simultaneously legitimize the possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons [00:12:48].

### Preventing [[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization|Mobilization]]

The chances of preventing [[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization|mobilization]] are considered slim [00:13:19]. One theoretical chance involves the public critically discussing the need for [[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization|mobilization]], which might be reported to Putin by the Federal Security Service (FSB) and influence his decision [00:13:28]. The speaker indicates that individual strategies for salvation will be hinted at in a future program [00:13:52].

The speaker highlights a concern that current decision-makers operate based on a different "logic" and "worldview" than the general public or experts [00:07:15]. This "logic" led to the events of February 24, which many believed were impossible [00:15:10]. The speaker urges listeners to accept that "other forms of thinking" exist, which possess "colossal power" in decision-making and are not easily understood or deterred by those around them [00:15:33].

Psychological symptoms among high-ranking figures, such as "hysterical statements" and "cynical and baseness of statements," suggest that "despair and anger are spread in the air" both at the bottom and the top of Russian society [00:16:19].

More detailed information on [[legal_grounds_for_mobilization_in_russia|mobilization]] from a legal point of view is promised in a subsequent program [00:17:39].

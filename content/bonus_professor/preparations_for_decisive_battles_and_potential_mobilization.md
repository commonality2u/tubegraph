The end of 2022 saw both sides in the conflict preparing for a decisive battle, concentrating forces and strategizing for future offensives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Ukraine's Preparations
Ukraine is expected to receive significant military aid from NATO countries and allies. This includes 2,000 tanks and other armored vehicles, over 800 artillery systems, more than 2 million shells, and multiple launch rocket systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This equipment is intended to enable Ukraine to launch a strategic offensive aimed at reaching its state borders with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Russia's Response and Mobilization Plans
Russia's response includes striking Ukraine's energy system to cause disorganization, industrial disruption, and demoralization, hoping to pressure President Zelensky and trigger a new wave of emigration to European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

Russia also anticipates receiving new weapons systems from Iran, primarily ballistic missiles, with the first batch possibly transferred before the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This information, though Russia and Iran are expected to deny it, was publicly stated by the head of Israeli Mossad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Focus on Manpower
A key element of Russia's strategy is [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] and the concentration of manpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This reliance on manpower echoes the strategy from the mid-20th century, despite Russia's current demographic potential being incomparably lower than during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Discussions at the Ministry of Defense session about changing service terms and increasing numbers are seen as propaganda preparation for a new [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The Kremlin believes that a quantitative advantage is essential for achieving victory or honorable peace terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

These [[potential_future_mobilization_and_military_strategies | mobilization efforts]] are expected to commence soon after the New Year holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Plans include:
*   A partial or complete closure of borders, likely partial for those in the [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   A mobilization base estimated to contain about 7 million people, with a target of 2 million mobilized, including 300,000 women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   Limited movement between subjects of the Russian Federation for those in the base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   More intensive use of the Guard, police, and DZOV workers for the detection, identification, and escort of mobilized personnel to collection points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   Mobilized personnel will be sent to the front lines almost immediately without preliminary training, as there are insufficient organizational and technical capacities in the European part of Russia for full-fledged training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Despite some individuals potentially hiding or attempting to leave Russia, significant resistance is not anticipated. Kremlin sociology, including data from the Federal Security Service, suggests that while people may not like [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_Russia | mobilization]], they will resignedly comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

Notorious figure Yevgeny Prigozhin, who admits to recruiting from colonies and prisons, has proposed using prisoners and women from women's colonies, citing existing experience with women in military conditions, including assault squads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. There are also rumors of attempts to attract patients from neuropsychiatric dispensaries, not for frontline combat, but to participate in building the "Surovikin line," a defensive fortification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. This line is intended to break Ukraine's strategic offensive, after which Russia plans its own counteroffensive, potentially using Belarusian territory and other directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## Putin's Vision of Victory
Putin reportedly received a message from China outlining conditions for visits and telephone conversations, including a plan for completing the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. In response, Putin conveyed confidence in a final victory to be achieved no later than mid-summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

Victory, in this context, is understood as acquiring new territories and entering peace negotiations, potentially resulting in a truce or ceasefire by mid-summer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

Initially, the stated goals of the operation were "demilitarization" and "denazification." Putin has sarcastically suggested that the goal of demilitarization has already been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. However, a new, more ambitious goal has emerged: "the unification of the Russian people," which Putin has claimed as a globalist aim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This objective implies unifying Russians living in Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and the Baltic countries with the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

### Critique of "Unification" Goal
This goal is seen as fantastic and counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. Despite historical and cultural proximity, Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians are distinct peoples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. The speaker argues that efforts by Vladimir Vladimirovich have alienated ethnic groups and countries that once felt sympathy for Russia, causing them to view Russia as a "leper country" or a "plague" due to its use of force for "brotherly love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. Such a policy raises wariness in sovereign countries, both near and far from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

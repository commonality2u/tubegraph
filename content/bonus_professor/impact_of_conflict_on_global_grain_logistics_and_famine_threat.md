## Limitation of Ukrainian Grain Exports
The continuation of the conflict has severely limited Ukraine's ability to export grain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. This disruption in logistics means that even if grain exists, its transportation is interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.

## Threat of Global Famine
As a direct consequence of these logistical disruptions, there is growing discussion about the threat of global famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. While global famine has not yet materialized, the speaker emphasizes that the threat is not illusory due to the ongoing disruptions in grain logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. This issue contributes to the broader [[impact_of_food_crises_and_preparedness_strategies | impact of food crises]].

## Political Implications and Propaganda
The potential for global famine has become a factor in [[geopolitical_implications | international discussions]] regarding the conflict. French and German politicians, among others, are subtly pushing for a peaceful resolution with Ukraine, partially due to the desire to prevent an increase in the burden on European Union countries from refugees and to address the grain export crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

Russian propaganda and officials are actively exploiting and amplifying the threat of global famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

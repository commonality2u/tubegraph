This article summarizes the military and political developments of the [[russia_ukraine_conflict|Russia-Ukraine conflict]] during the week leading up to Sunday, May 22, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Military Situation and Shifting Strategies

### Azovstal Surrender
The surrender of Azovstal fighters is considered a military and symbolic success for Russia, according to Russian propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. However, this event does not constitute a strategic turning point in the [[russianukrainian_relations_and_military_tensions|armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Other Fronts
In the past week, Ukrainian troops successfully carried out a counteroffensive, pushing [[russian_military_tactics_in_ukraine|Russian troops]] away from Kharkiv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Fierce battles are ongoing on the Seversky Donets, which are not expected to result in Russian success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Fate of Azovstal Fighters
Two main options are likely for the Azovstal fighters:
*   **Public Trial for Azov Regiment**: Participants of the "Azov" regiment, which is banned and declared extremist in Russia, are expected to face a public trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This is intended to demonstrate to Russia and the world that the "denazification of Ukraine," which Russia cited as a reason for its special military operation, was justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Prisoner Exchange**: Those not associated with the Azov regiment are likely to be exchanged for Russian prisoners of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The exact timing of such exchanges will be personally decided by the President of the Russian Federation, based on the political situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Shifting Russian Strategy and European Reactions

Russia is increasingly less focused on achieving a strategic turning point in the conflict and is more interested in consolidating the current territorial status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The goal is to legalize this new status quo through negotiations with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This involves:
*   Recognition of Crimea as Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   Recognition of Donbass as independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   Recognition of Russian control over territories in the Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions, forming a land bridge to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Revival of Russian Agents of Influence
A symptom of Russia's shifting strategy is the revival of Russian "agents of influence" within European Union countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a personal friend of Putin, publicly stated that Europe must convince Ukraine to accept Russia's conditions for negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   The Italian Foreign Ministry nearly simultaneously presented proposals to end the conflict, which, while not overtly pro-Russian, could be advantageous for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   French and German politicians are also implicitly or explicitly suggesting that Ukraine make peace "here and now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Reasons for European Leaders' Stance
Several factors contribute to certain European leaders pushing for peace:
1.  **Russian Influence and Leverage**: Russia holds leverage and influence over some European politicians, including French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
2.  **Fear of [[escalation_of_military_action_between_russia_and_ukraine|Conflict Escalation]]**: European leaders fear further [[escalation_of_military_action_between_russia_and_ukraine|conflict escalation]], which could lead to the use of non-conventional weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Additionally, an escalation would inevitably increase the number of refugees, placing a significant financial and social burden on EU countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
3.  **Global Famine Threat**: The ongoing conflict severely limits Ukraine's ability to export grain, raising concerns about a global famine due to disrupted logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Russian propaganda and officials are reportedly playing up this threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Ukraine's Position and Future Plans

Ukrainian President Zelensky maintains that the outcome of the [[ukraine_russia_conflict_analysis|conflict]] will be determined on the battlefield, with peace negotiations commencing once Ukraine gains military advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Ukraine's stance is primarily supported by the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as Poland and the Baltic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### US Pressure on European Leaders
The United States has reportedly made it clear to Chancellor Scholz and President Macron that they possess compromising information on them, and that these leaders should adhere to the principles of Euro-Atlantic solidarity and NATO's course of unconditional support for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This implies a strategy of "waging war to a victorious end" for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### Ukraine's Counteroffensive
Ukraine is planning a strategic turning point, expecting to achieve technological and military superiority by the end of summer or early autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Their far-reaching plans aim to restore the territorial status quo to at least that of February 24, 2022, and potentially include regaining Donbass and even Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Internal Russian Dynamics and Concerns

The intention of Ukraine to launch a counteroffensive is reportedly causing tension on the Russian side, as evidenced by Russian propaganda statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   Some Russian military figures, not connected with the General Staff, are voicing a more realistic perspective, suggesting that Russia might be prepared to lose recently acquired territories, possibly even Donbass, if Ukraine crosses the Russian border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   Russia is observed constructing defensive fortifications immediately after acquiring new territories, indicating preparations for defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   The stability of these new territories is questioned, despite official declarations of them being "forever with Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

### Internal Corruption and Discontent
Concerns exist regarding potential corruption related to reconstruction efforts in newly acquired territories, such as Mariupol and Kherson, described as a "gold mine" for construction officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
The Russian import substitution program, which received colossal budget financing for 14 years, has reportedly "failed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. This failure is a source of discontent among the "KGB lobby," who believe the program was implemented in personal and group interests rather than national ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

### Putin's Health and Systemic Weakness
The discontent among security officers with President Putin indicates that the Russian system is beginning to "vibrate" and disintegrate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. There are reports, including from director Oliver Stone, that Putin is experiencing serious health problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This weakening of the key element (Putin) is leading to turbulence within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

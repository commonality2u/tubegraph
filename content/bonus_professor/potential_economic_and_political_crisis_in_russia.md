The "Answers to Hot Questions" program, recorded on January 11 and aired on January 12, discusses the prospects of a political and economic crisis in Russia. Valery Solovey, the host, addresses various related concerns, including the inevitability of political turmoil, the nature of a potential economic downturn, and the implications of ongoing mobilization efforts.

## Inevitable Political Crisis
A [[prospects_of_political_crisis_and_potential_changes_in_russian_governance | political crisis]] in Russia is considered inevitable within the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. While revolutions are difficult to predict, a [[prospects_of_political_crisis_and_potential_changes_in_russian_governance | political crisis]] can be predicted with high accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The most probable outcome for this crisis is widespread unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Turmoil vs. Revolution
The concept of "turmoil" is described as a series of conflicts of varying types, nature, and intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. This is seen as a potential replacement for a revolution or civil war, and is considered a more likely development of the [[prospects_of_political_crisis_and_potential_changes_in_russian_governance | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

### Duration and Consequences
A survey of 167 US-European experts suggests a potential disintegration of the Russian Federation within 10 years of "troubled times," leading to independent regions and Russia becoming a failed state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. If the [[economic_challenges_and_political_crisis_developments_in_russia | crisis]] is prolonged, much in Russia will be called into question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. However, if the [[economic_challenges_and_political_crisis_developments_in_russia | crisis]] is short-term (1.5 to 2 years maximum), the integrity of the Russian Federation is not expected to be threatened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

## Economic Outlook
The likelihood of an [[russian_economic_crisis_and_forecasts | economic crisis]] is assessed as quite high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:17">[00:26:17]</a>, with the primary causes expected to be political rather than purely economic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>.

### Economic Challenges
Despite predictions of a crisis, a complete "collapse" where the economy ceases to function or basic provisions disappear is not anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. However, significant challenges are expected, including:
*   Mass impoverishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>
*   Logistics disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>
*   "Fever" in the national currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>
*   High inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>

It is suggested that Russia has historically endured tougher times and will "survive again" these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

## Mobilization and Border Restrictions
A "second wave of mobilization" is expected to begin shortly, despite official denials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. These denials from sources like Peskov are interpreted as an indication that the mobilization is imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Travel Restrictions
Currently, 8 million Russians are already prohibited from crossing the border due to debts (e.g., loans, alimony) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. These individuals are expected to be among the first to receive summonses for mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. An additional database of conscripts, potentially including categories A, B, and C, is expected to be formed, adding another 7-8 million people to the travel ban list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. In total, up to 15-20 million people—approximately every seventh citizen—could be prohibited from leaving the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. On January 10, an additional 4 million Russians reportedly faced border crossing bans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

### Martial Law and Total War
Martial law is anticipated to be introduced when mobilization becomes openly declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This initial phase might be termed an "additional modulation set" rather than open mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Around the anniversary of the special military operation, a concept of "people's war" or "total war" is expected to be introduced, leading to the official declaration of general mobilization and martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

### Students
While students with deferments are generally protected from mobilization due to their studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, there is no guarantee they will not be included in the database of those prohibited from leaving the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Even under general mobilization and martial law, students are expected to remain exempt from direct conscription, but a travel ban is likely to affect them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Leadership and Governance
Putin is described as having a staff of highly competent analysts at the Security Council who accurately predict the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. However, Putin reportedly dislikes and dismisses their conclusions, attempting to "turn the tide of history" through his own "senile weakening will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Some Russians may not understand where the leadership is leading them because they are afraid to imagine the consequences, while others understand but remain silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. The criteria for effective governance in Russia is asserted to be the ability to "love your homeland [and] your people a little and wish them well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>, contrasting with the current state of "violence, theft, fraud and corruption on a universal scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

## Outlook for 2023
The year 2023 is presented as having a strong chance to decisively change the fate of Russia and its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>. Despite the current difficulties, a "victory" is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.

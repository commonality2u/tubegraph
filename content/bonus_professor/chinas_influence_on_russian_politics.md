The influence of China on Russia has become a central theme in contemporary international relations, particularly concerning the Russian Federation's internal political landscape and its foreign policy decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Background: The Beijing Visit
In May 2024, a significant event for the [[influence_of_international_relations_on_russian_politics | Russian Federation]] was the trip of its "so-called president" (referred to as a double, Evgeny Vasilyevich) to Beijing, heading a representative delegation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This visit was framed as the real masters of Russia sending the "prince" to Beijing to "receive a label from the Chinese Bogdykhan to reign in Moscow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Kremlin's Objectives
Moscow pursued several key goals during this visit:
*   **Legitimization of the Double** The primary aim was to achieve legitimization for the "double" as president, hoping that China's acceptance would lead to broader international recognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Influence on Ukraine Summit** Russia sought to persuade China to pressure the [[chinas_stance_on_russia_and_ukraine_conflict | Russian Federation]] not to participate in the Swiss summit on Ukraine, a task the Kremlin reportedly could not manage on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. However, just after the meeting, the Chinese indicated they would consider sending a delegation to Switzerland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Continued Military Support** Obtaining guarantees of continued support for military operations against Ukraine was crucial, as Chinese supply of dual-use products is critical for Russia's military actions and economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Resolution of Bank Payments** The Kremlin aimed to resolve issues with bank payments stuck in or returned by Chinese banks, which significantly hinder mutual trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. No decision was reached on this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
*   **Power of Siberia 2 Gas Pipeline** Russia hoped to secure China's consent for the construction of the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This project also received no definite decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

## Beijing's Objectives
China's goals for the visit were primarily twofold:
*   **Assessment of New Russian Leadership** Beijing sought to observe the "new composition of the Russian leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Readiness to Fulfill Secret Agreement** More importantly, China wanted to understand Moscow's readiness to fulfill a secret agreement signed by the "late Russian President Vladimir Putin" in February 2022 with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, on the eve of the Beijing Olympics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### The Secret Agreement
This secret agreement, hidden from the Russian public, dictates that China receives a lease of gigantic territories in Siberia and the Far East for 49 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This lease includes the right to develop natural resources and organize administration, effectively transferring political and legal control over these territories away from the [[influence_and_interests_of_foreign_countries_in_russian_politics | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This arrangement was the price paid for China's support of the "special military operation" in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The agreement is described as an "act of national treason" by all laws of the [[influence_of_international_relations_on_russian_politics | Russian Federation]] and international standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

China's primary concern was Russia's commitment to implementing this treaty, which was set to come into effect on January 1, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The Kremlin, conversely, attempted to postpone its effect due to fear of a "monstrous scandal and domestic political crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. The Chinese did not decide on this postponement during the visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

## China's Dominance and Russia's Humiliation
Throughout the visit, Russia was perceived as a supplicant, while China acted as a master <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. The Chinese did not give clear "yes" or "no" answers to Russia's requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Key Russian figures, Sergei Chemezov and Nikolai Patrushev, notably did not go to Beijing, unwilling to be associated with the "humiliating requests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

The "legitimization of the double" was achieved through a scene of "colossal, unprecedented humiliation" for the entire Russian delegation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. The "so-called Putin" was treated like a "pathetic doll of a pathetic puppet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. A supposed "one-on-one meeting" between the "double" and Xi Jinping involved no substantive discussions, only "praises of wisdom, strength, and strong-willed dignity of the Chinese leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This was not a true one-on-one meeting, as Russian controllers and a translator were present to prevent the "double" from saying anything inappropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Some Russian delegates were even restricted from accessing restrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

### Symbolic Agreements
Despite the lack of significant breakthroughs on major issues, an agreement on cooperation regarding Bolshoy Usuriysky Island was signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Although formally divided between the two countries, China considers the island entirely its own and depicts it as such on its maps, to which the [[influence_of_international_relations_on_russian_politics | Russian Federation]] does not protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This is seen as a hint that the Kremlin is ready to proceed with the secret agreement despite potential scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

### Chinese Interest in Belousov
The Chinese showed significant interest in Andrei Belousov, seeing him as a potential "new strong man of the Russian government" and a counterparty for future dealings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Belousov's attitude towards China is described as "restrained [and] suspicious" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>.

## Conclusion: [[chinas_geopolitical_stance_and_its_impact_on_russia | China's Geopolitical Stance and its Impact on Russia]]
The Beijing visit yielded "very modest legitimization of the double" for Russia, but no major decisions on critical issues like bank payments or the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. The outcome is considered "frankly dangerous for Russia" because its "territorial integrity and national sovereignty" have been called into question by the secret treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. The current Russian leadership is partly prepared to implement this act of national treason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. The events discussed are expected to "shake Russia in the literal sense of the word" and concern, among other things, the Russian-Ukrainian confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

This article discusses the [[political_situation_in_russia | Russian political climate]], focusing on the immediate aftermath of Alexei Navalny's death in February 2024. The speaker expresses strong opinions on the circumstances surrounding Navalny's passing and its implications for [[russian_internal_politics_and_economy | internal Russian politics]].

## Navalny's Death: A Political Murder?

On Friday, February 16, after 7:00 pm, news broke that Alexei Navalny had died or been killed, prompting an emergency broadcast [00:00:33]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The speaker offered condolences to Navalny's family, friends, and sympathizers, noting that Navalny is listed as a terrorist and extremist [00:01:06]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Navalny was described as a politician with an "amazing quality" of commitment to his goals [00:01:25]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

The speaker is "inclined in favor of the second version" of Navalny's death, believing it to be a political murder rather than a natural death [00:01:48]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. An international etiological investigation would be needed to convince the speaker otherwise [00:01:56]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Even if natural, the speaker asserts that the Kremlin created "impossible conditions" over several years, including nearly a year in a punishment cell, to critically impact Navalny's health and psyche [00:02:11]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Indirect Evidence for Political Murder

Several indirect signs support the claim of political murder:
*   A very quick, unanimous reaction from the [[russian_political_situation_and_governance_issues | Russian official media]], which reported the news "on command" [00:03:09]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   An unusually quick reaction from Peskov [00:03:22]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   At least two or three assassination attempts on "very dangerous and important opponents" of the elite group claiming full power in [[the_political_climate_in_russia_and_government_policies | Russia]] in the month prior to Navalny's death [00:03:35]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. These attempts were fortunately unsuccessful for the regime [00:07:18]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Official Narratives and Their Refutation

The speaker anticipates "cynical lies and real nonsense" from the authorities regarding the circumstances of Navalny's death, which the speaker views as a murder [00:04:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Anticipated narratives include:
*   Navalny is alive and well abroad [00:04:18]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   The West sacrificed him to compromise the "so-called presidential elections" or to "blur the effect" of Putin's interview with Tucker Carlson [00:04:23]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. This is described as "blurring" in PR jargon, to distract from the essence of what is happening [00:04:55]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   It was "categorically unprofitable for the Kremlin" [00:05:18]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The speaker refutes this argument by citing previous instances like the murder of Nemtsov, the poisoning of Navalny, and the start of the [[russian_political_climate_and_mobilization | Russian military operation]] against Ukraine, all of which were similarly deemed "unprofitable" by experts but still occurred [00:05:26]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

The speaker argues that Navalny's death *is* profitable, logical, and consistent for the Kremlin [00:06:02]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The same individuals who allegedly orchestrated Navalny's poisoning are believed to have completed the operation now [00:06:13]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The primary motivation is to "remove any risks, remove any threats" on the eve of the presidential elections and, more importantly, "on the eve of the transfer of power" to an elite group claiming full power in the [[russian_political_analysis | Russian Federation]] [00:06:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This is described as "squeezing out all the grass, cement[ing] all the fields where this grass may appear" [00:06:57]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Call for Transparency
> To refute accusations against the Kremlin, the speaker suggests inviting international Western experts, particularly from Germany (where Navalny was diagnosed), to conduct a public examination of Navalny's body [00:08:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The body should be released to the family, not held by the Federal Penitentiary Service [00:08:26]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Implications for the Future of [[political_and_economic_climate_in_russia | Russian Politics]]

The speaker warns that [[russian_internal_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Russian oppositionists]], both within and outside the country, are now under increased threat [00:10:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. This is seen not as a joke but as a "serious warning" and a "lesson" [00:10:19]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

The year 2024 is predicted to be "very difficult," not just dramatic but likely "tragic" [00:10:46]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. It is expected to be "much harder" than the year the pandemic began or the year the special military operation began, potentially "the hardest year in our entire life" [00:10:59]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The chances of this are "extremely high" [00:11:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

Despite the bleak outlook, the speaker conveys a "crumb of... confidence" and "hope" that "everything will change for the better and will begin to change already in this 2024" [00:12:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The speaker concludes with a belief that "victory will be ours" [00:12:29]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

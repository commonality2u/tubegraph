Valery Solovey, in the 46th episode of his program, discussed the [[vladimir_putins_policies_and_impact | President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin's]] address to Russians, characterizing it as a "parting word for military action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. He strongly advised against re-watching it, describing it as "a clot of negative emotions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Tone and Outlook for 2023

The speaker noted that a photo accompanying the address showed a "man with a face distorted with pain and hatred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This address promised severe trials, effectively predicting that 2023 would be a year of military action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This somber prediction made it difficult to consider it a "New Year's wish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Implications for Mobilization

Directly following the president's address, actions were reportedly being taken to ensure his wishes for Russians would "come true 146 percent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. A bill was reportedly in its third reading in the State Duma, just before the New Year, which would legally allow mobilization summonses to be served by registered mail with notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

This means that if an individual receives a notice for a registered letter, upon signing for it at the post office, they are considered notified of the summons, regardless of whether they open the letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Even refusing to take the letter from the postman would mean the summons is considered handed over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The speaker advised that any notice for a registered letter should be viewed as a call to fulfill "patriotic duty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

The upcoming second round, or continuation, of what is termed [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | partial mobilization]] in Russia has raised numerous questions regarding its various aspects, particularly concerning strategies for public compliance and the [[consequences_and_strategies_for_individuals_during_mobilization | consequences and strategies for individuals]] [00:00:58].

## Potential Restrictions and Compliance Measures

While amendments to the law on the creation of a single register of military personnel do not explicitly mention the blocking of bank accounts and cards, this measure is seen as the most effective way to compel individuals to report to military registration and enlistment offices [00:01:50, 00:03:34, 00:04:42]. Other restrictions outlined in the law include:
*   A ban on traveling to the border [00:02:06].
*   A ban on real estate transactions [00:02:08].
*   A ban on registering or operating as an individual entrepreneur [00:02:11, 00:02:13].
*   A ban on driving a car [00:02:18].

However, the effectiveness of these official restrictions is questioned, as a significant portion of the population (e.g., 80% without foreign passports) may not be affected [00:02:30]. Currently, there is no criminal punishment for evading [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]] in the Criminal Code, and no one was administratively or criminally punished for evasion during the previous [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | partial mobilization]] [00:03:06, 00:03:27, 00:07:51].

It is speculated that blocking bank accounts and cards, despite not being in the law, is a planned and effective tool, for which the banking system has been preparing since September of the previous year [00:04:47, 00:05:01, 00:05:06]. This measure might target only those who receive electronic summonses or appeals to create a "multiplier effect" [00:05:18, 00:05:26].

## Strategies for Individuals

In light of these potential measures, individuals are advised to prepare for the worst [00:06:10].

For those already living with financial restrictions due to debts (e.g., loans, alimony), similar conditions may apply [00:05:40]. Russian authorities are not interested in how individuals manage their work or finances under these circumstances [00:06:01].

### Avoiding Mobilization and Martial Law
*   **Leaving the Country:** Under martial law, it is likely that only those in the database of individuals potentially subject to [[mobilization_process_in_Russia | mobilization]] (currently around 15 million people and expanding) will be restricted from leaving. Others, including women, pensioners, and children, will likely be able to enter and leave Russia [00:06:31, 00:06:55].
*   **Deregistration by Proxy:** There is no point in communicating with Russian authorities or reporting information about a son living abroad, even if he has a residence permit; let them contact you [00:07:12, 00:07:27].
*   **Criminal Liability:** As of now, there is no criminal liability for evasion, and it is unlikely to appear [00:07:49].
*   **"Hunting" for Conscripts:** Authorities will not "hunt for everyone" but will set "traps" in busy public places such as train stations, metro stations, and supermarkets, especially in large cities. They will staff these locations with police patrols and military enlistment office personnel [00:08:46, 00:09:07].
*   **Contract Service Pressure:** Conscripts may be pressured to sign contracts for military service almost immediately upon being called up, instead of the previous three-month waiting period [00:09:26, 00:09:35]. Individuals are advised *not* to sign anything and to contact lawyers [00:10:00].
*   **Students:** Students, including those in correspondence, full-time, and part-time courses, are generally entitled to a deferment. However, graduates (bachelors and masters) who finished their studies in the current year are at risk if they do not secure a master's degree program or an enterprise that provides a reservation to avoid conscription [00:10:24, 00:10:51, 00:11:06].
*   **Traveling within Russia:** Reservists should be wary of traveling by plane and train, as airports and train stations are high-traffic areas where those who could be called up will be monitored. Those who have received a summons are especially at risk. Traveling by changing trains might be a consideration [00:12:02].
*   **Martial Law and Movement:** Martial law may include a ban on the movement of Russians between regions [00:12:37, 00:12:52].
*   **Hiding:** Hiding in remote villages is generally ineffective if locals report "strange young people." It is better to evade large cities, avoiding areas of high traffic like shopping centers and train stations [00:21:39, 00:21:59, 00:22:03].

## Broader [[consequences_and_impact_of_mobilization | Consequences and Impact of Mobilization]]

The speaker expresses doubt that the upcoming [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | mobilization]] will shift public opinion towards peace or human rights concerns, though latent discontent is accumulating [00:13:55, 00:14:02, 00:14:14].

There is no expectation that Russia will break apart if it loses to Ukraine; the potential for preserving Russia's unity is considered much higher than separatist potential, despite potential problems in regions like the North Caucasus and the Volga region [00:18:40, 00:19:03, 00:19:08]. The risk of Russia's collapse is considered negligible unless the current political crisis drags on for an extended period (more than a year and a half) [00:27:24, 00:27:37].

The Russian government's proposal to require tax authorities to be informed of all cash holdings over a million rubles indicates an intention for tighter digital and financial control over individuals, moving towards an "electronic Gulag" [00:19:51, 00:20:24, 00:20:39].

The repression within Russia is expected to intensify rapidly, not over years, but months [00:25:50, 00:26:04].

Regarding security forces (estimated at over 1.5 million people), in a scenario where the country changes for the better, some will be retired, some will be subject to lustration, and some will remain, but all structures will undergo decisive reform. The court and other departments will also be reformed, though this will take several years [00:35:21, 00:35:34, 00:35:41, 00:35:50, 00:36:11]. Political will is deemed crucial for these reforms, and it is believed to exist [00:36:19].

## Public Compliance and Action

The approach to political action should be contextual. While the speaker previously called for action when risks were relatively small (e.g., elections, referendum), given the current "colossally high" risks for people, direct calls for mass action are deemed dangerous [00:28:41, 00:29:22, 00:30:20].

Current recommended actions include reposts and financial assistance to those fighting for freedom and justice [00:29:50, 00:29:52].

The "Russian passivity" is acknowledged as a characteristic where people are like "plasticine" that can be molded for good or bad. This passivity could be an advantage when a sensible government emerges, making it easier to negotiate with society [00:31:01, 00:31:07, 00:31:28].

Russian society is seen as being based on "total injustice" and "total trampling of human and civil rights." The goal is to make the country and society incomparably more just, which will require serious changes [00:32:19, 00:32:22, 00:32:28, 00:32:36].

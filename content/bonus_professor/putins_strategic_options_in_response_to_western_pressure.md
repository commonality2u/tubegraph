On Sunday, February 19th, Valery Solovey recorded the 51st issue of his program "What's Happening" which delves into the geopolitical landscape surrounding Russia and the potential responses from President [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]] to intensifying Western pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. The key theme is the declaration of a "crusade against [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

## The Western Ultimatum

The main foreign political event of the past week, the Munich conference, effectively declared a "crusade against Mr. [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]] personally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. The core of this campaign consists of two main theses:
1.  The West is deliberately attempting to inflict [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | military defeat]] on Russia and strip it of all territorial gains in Ukraine, including Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
2.  No threats from [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]] or Russia, including the use of nuclear weapons, will deter the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

It is suggested that [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]] is being provoked to react harshly, possibly to incite his inner circle to take decisive action to prevent "inadequate actions by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This is seen not as a peace proposal, but an [[western_ultimatum_to_putin_and_russias_response | Ultimatum]] personally directed against the President, as a military defeat would lead to "immediate political conclusions for his personal destiny and for the destiny of the political regime he created" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.

## China's Ambiguous Position

China's stance is described as "very interesting and ambiguous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. While China declares opposition to unilateral sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, it is "drifting towards the position of the Western coalition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. China insists on peace and is prepared to present its own Peace Plan, which is based on "respect for the sovereignty of both parties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. This implies Russia must renounce its territorial claims from Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. The fact that China intends to present this plan soon suggests it has been in development for a long time, indicating that China does not believe in the possibility of victory for the Russian Federation nor in the "strategic genius of President [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. A meeting between Xi Jinping and [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]] was made conditional on Russia achieving a decisive victory or going for peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>, and China now considers the first option to be "crossed out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

## Putin's Expected Responses

[[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]] is expected to provide both a verbal and a practical (military) answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

### Verbal Response: The Federal Assembly Address

The verbal answer is anticipated in [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]]'s message to the Federal Assembly on February 21st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. Traditionally, the Kremlin inflates the information agenda before such addresses, with rumors of "fateful decisions" and "sharp turns in policy," which usually turn out to be "information bubbles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. The only serious announcement in recent memory was the constitutional reform in January 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

Three potential options for the message, categorized by their level of radicalism, are presented:

*   **"Horror Horror" Option (Radical)**
    *   [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]] declares a "people's war on NATO to the last Russian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.
    *   This would include a general mobilization, martial law, and similar measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>.
    *   Currently, there are no signs this option will be chosen, as [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]] himself seems "afraid of such a radical option" given his personal experience with the decision on February 24th last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

*   **"Just Horror" Option (Escalation to Compensate Failures)**
    *   Since Russia has not achieved "fateful successes" in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>, this option involves announcing new "victories" to compensate for failures and respond to the Western ultimatum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.
    *   This could include the "inclusion of South Ossetia, Abkhazia into Russia and the declaration of independence of Transnistria with a subsequent geopolitical throw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.
    *   The speaker dismisses this as unlikely to be taken seriously by the Russian populace, who are unfamiliar with these regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. The effect would be similar to the "mythical battle for Popasnaya" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.

*   **"Usual Nonsense" Option (Status Quo)**
    *   This involves [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]] making "many threats, many hints" but announcing "not a single decision" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>.
    *   He prefers to "throw a pebble into a pond and looks at the circles that diverge" to gauge public reaction before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.
    *   This third option is considered the most probable, though the final decision is made just hours before the proclamation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>.

### Practical Response: A New Offensive

The practical part of [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]]'s response is a new offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>. This offensive must be carried out and succeed as quickly as possible, *before* Ukraine receives advanced Western weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a>. These Western weapons are seen as capable of significantly increasing Russian losses and are key to Ukraine's planned counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>.

However, the Russian military is reportedly reluctant to go on the offensive, believing it would be a "big mistake," which reflects the poor "moral and psychological state" of the armed forces and command staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>. There is also an "acute shortage of weapons in the Russian armed forces," forcing Russia to use remnants of Soviet weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:21:00">[17:21:00]</a>.

Despite [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]]'s desire for a new mobilization, and ongoing "organizational and technical preparations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:27:00">[18:27:00]</a>, it has not acquired an "open, acute and massive form" due to two reasons:
1.  Inability to acquire sufficient uniforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:03:00">[19:03:00]</a>.
2.  [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]] himself is "afraid" of such a measure, despite reports of successful partial mobilizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>. He also likes decisions to be unexpected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:50:00">[19:50:00]</a>.

### Lukashenko's Disbelief

Even [[kremlins_strategic_challenges_and_alliances | Putin]]'s closest ally, Alexander Lukashenko, demonstrates "completely obvious disbelief" in the "strategic talents of the Russian Supreme Leader" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:14:00">[20:14:00]</a>. During their meeting on February 17th, Lukashenko "openly trolling the Russian president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:36:00">[20:36:00]</a>. This reflects [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]]'s lack of "drive" and confidence in himself and the Russian armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>.

### The Nuclear Threat

Should the offensive fail, or if the command staff's reluctance develops into sabotage, the only option left for [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]] would be to "reach out for that very nuclear baton" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:48:00">[21:48:00]</a>. Both Chinese comrades and the West have made it clear they are not afraid of its use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:59:00">[21:59:00]</a>. Although some may assess the threat of nuclear weapon use as low (2-3%), even "one hundredth of one percent" is a colossal risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:10:00">[22:10:00]</a>. [[putins_strategy_and_plans_regarding_ukraine | Putin]] is psychologically and morally ready for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>. The world is arguably closer to the possibility of nuclear weapon use than "ever before in the 21st century and perhaps since the advent of nuclear weapons, even since the Cuban missile crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a>.

## Seymour Hersh's Revelations

The "revelations" by Pulitzer Prize winner Seymour Hersh regarding the explosion of the Northern Streams are mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:26:00">[23:26:00]</a>. It is asserted that the information provided by Hersh "has absolutely no relation" to reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:45:00">[23:45:00]</a>. The source of his information is not Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04:00">[24:04:00]</a>, which surprised Russian propaganda outlets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:34:00">[24:34:00]</a>. It is suggested that Hersh was "played blind," implying his "dementia state and the tendency to conspiracy theories" were exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:52:00">[24:52:00]</a>.

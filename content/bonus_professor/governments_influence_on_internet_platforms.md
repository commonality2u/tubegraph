The Russian government has demonstrated a significant and escalating [[the_impact_of_government_actions_on_citizen_freedoms | influence over internet platforms]] within the country, particularly regarding YouTube and WhatsApp. This move is presented as a measure to prevent "protest mobilization" and control the flow of information during anticipated political and economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

## Planned Blocking of YouTube and WhatsApp

Last week, exercises were conducted in Russia to slow down and block YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. These exercises, carried out under the instructions of Nikolai Patrushev, who is responsible for this sphere, were deemed "relatively successful" by the military-political leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Based on these results, a decision was made to block YouTube nationwide in August or September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This blocking will be a one-time event, similar to the previous banning of platforms like Facebook and Instagram in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Additionally, there are plans to block the messenger WhatsApp along with YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

The motivation behind these actions is to control information and communication. YouTube is seen as a "source of information about what is happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, while WhatsApp serves as a "coordinator" for actions and negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The government aims to "block the opportunity for protest mobilization" ahead of anticipated issues in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

### Anticipated Impact of Blocking

While the authorities believe the blocking itself will not trigger a mass negative "effective reaction" (i.e., actions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, it will add another layer of tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. The government views this blocking as a necessary risk to avoid "much more serious problems" in the near future, specifically this fall and early winter, which include political and economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Despite "victorious reports" about economic growth, the real [[economic_pressures_and_technological_sovereignty | economic situation]] is a significant concern for the authorities, with problems seen as inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

## Countermeasures for Users

Given the impending blocks, users are advised to take specific actions:
*   **Acquire a reliable VPN**: Users should obtain one or more reliable VPNs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. While the government will attempt to block VPNs, this is seen as an ongoing "fight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Register on Telegram**: Users are strongly encouraged to create an account on Telegram, as the authorities do not intend to block it, believing it to be technically impossible based on previous unsuccessful attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Challenges with VPN Usage

The implementation of widespread VPN usage faces several challenges:
*   **Audience Loss**: YouTube is expected to lose a portion of its audience, similar to how Instagram lost 30% to 40% (though Instagram's audience partly recovered) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This is due to fear among some users that using prohibited platforms might lead to risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Technical Literacy**: Many users are "technically absolutely not Podkova" and unable to install or understand VPNs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Information Ban**: Russian authorities have also decided to block any information or advertisements about how to use VPNs, making technical instructions publicly prohibited by law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

## Broader Context of Information Control

This push to block platforms like YouTube and WhatsApp is part of a larger trend in Russia concerning [[media_censorship_and_vpn_usage_in_russia | media censorship]] and information control. The speaker emphasizes the importance of alternative channels for receiving "operational information" during what is anticipated to be a "tense" and "extremely critical" situation this fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. The government's actions reflect its awareness of public sentiment, with analysis of "dissatisfaction with the authorities" conducted by entities like the Federal Security Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. While dissatisfaction is "very great," people are not currently ready to "oppose the authorities," preferring "emphatically loyalist" behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. This suggests the government perceives a window to tighten control without immediately provoking widespread protest.

Since March 4th, 2022, the discussion of events in Ukraine within Russia has become significantly restricted due to new legal measures and a tightening "information iron curtain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This has led to a situation where it is "not very clear how to talk now about the events happening in Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Legal Restrictions and Censorship
A new law, adopted by the State Duma on March 4th, 2022, and expected to be signed by the president, makes any phrase regarding the events in Ukraine potentially punishable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This law, along with new amendments to the administrative code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>, means that "any information can potentially be regarded if desired kopecks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> (implying it can be deemed fake or discrediting).

Furthermore, the term "anti-war movement" appears to be prohibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. As a result, commentators suggest using euphemisms like "peace movement" or "peace-loving part of the public" to discuss related topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. The official term for the events in Ukraine, as used by Russian propaganda, is a "military special operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The term "military campaign" is suggested as a more accurate alternative that does not violate the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

This situation reflects the broader [[repressive_laws_and_implications_for_russian_society | repressive laws and implications for Russian society]], where official narratives are strictly enforced.

## Impact on Media and Public Discourse
The new laws have had a severe [[impact_of_new_laws_in_russia | impact on media freedom]] in Russia:
*   Alternative media outlets have "practically ceased to exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   Many media organizations, such as the Ural building sign and Silver Rain (which stopped producing news), have been forced to close or severely restrict their content due to the "impossibility of speaking even a tiny bit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   This environment is "painfully reminiscent of the Soviet Union" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, with limited media channels available.

Online platforms are also under threat. YouTube, a very popular video hosting site in Russia used for entertainment and practical content, is under threat of closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Even without direct political content, the closure of such platforms could affect many who earn money from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. While YouTube itself has already reduced monetization for Russian users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, the authorities may be hesitant to close it completely due to its large, non-politicized audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The introduction of censorship, even without a formal declaration, indicates that "martial law is already partially introduced in the Russian Federation" de facto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This affects the [[impact_of_the_current_situation_on_russian_civil_rights | civil rights of Russian citizens]], as it limits freedom of speech and expression.

## Future Implications for Discussion
The speaker warns that the situation will likely worsen, drawing parallels to past predictions that have come true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. The difficulty of discussing these topics is set to increase as the "information iron curtain" continues to descend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The speaker encourages strengthening "horizontal connections" and mutual aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a> to convey a "clear voice of common sense, human dignity and moral sobriety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

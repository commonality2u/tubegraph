Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, "What's Happening," aims to influence the future of Russia and its people [02:04:06]. Solovyov states that 2023 is a crucial year where an "opportunity" may arise to change the country's destiny [02:07:07, 02:10:05]. He emphasizes the importance of channels of influence, like his YouTube channel, to reach one million subscribers, doubling the current half a million, to leverage this perceived opening [01:31:02, 01:41:04, 02:29:02].

## Contradictory Official Narratives

Public statements from Russian President Vladimir Putin often contain internal contradictions, which some perceive as a "pathologically sick consciousness" [03:51:04, 03:57:08, 03:59:09]. Key statements include claims that "everything is going according to plan" and that there will be "no mobilization" [03:39:09, 03:43:08, 03:46:04]. Skepticism towards Putin's promises is high, citing past unfulfilled pledges such as not raising the retirement age or not running for a third term [05:10:06, 05:15:02]. His stance on nuclear weapons is perceived by the West as a readiness to use them [06:06:05, 06:10:06].

## Deteriorating Economic and Demographic Situation

Despite official bravado, economic forecasts are becoming gloomier [06:15:06, 06:35:05, 06:37:09]. Alfa Bank, through economist Natalia Orlova, predicts Russia's GDP will decrease by 6.5% in 2023, which would be the largest fall since 2009 [06:42:07, 06:49:03, 06:54:02, 07:11:03, 07:17:09]. This contrasts sharply with official forecasts from the Central Bank (2.0-2.1% fall) and the Ministry of Economic Development (less than 1% fall) [06:58:02, 07:03:04, 07:07:06]. This crisis is viewed as having a different nature, preventing quick recovery due to decreased domestic demand, export restrictions, and declining investment [07:36:06, 07:44:03, 07:48:02, 07:52:03, 07:55:09].

[[russian_societal_change_and_public_dissatisfaction | Societal challenges]] are also evident in employment: by early summer, 13% (4.3 million) of Russia's working-age population were on unpaid, partially paid leave, or idle [08:03:01, 08:11:02, 08:18:02, 08:23:02].

Demographically, Russia faces a severe decline. In October 2022, the birth rate fell by 11% compared to the previous year, and the population had already decreased by half a million people since the start of the year [09:23:02, 09:26:02, 09:30:02, 09:33:02, 09:35:08]. This trend suggests a degradation of the "anthropological material" in Russia, with an implied goal of turning the country into a land ruled by a small elite with a limited number of servants [09:46:04, 09:51:02, 09:54:06, 10:00:00, 10:08:04].

## Shifting [[public_opinion_and_its_impact_on_russian_political_dynamics | Public Opinion]] and "Turbo Patriots"

Even "Turbo Patriots" – audiences of military Telegram channels and state TV propaganda – are experiencing a change in mood [10:14:04, 10:18:05, 10:59:04, 11:03:04]. According to focus groups commissioned by the Kremlin (reported by Dossier Center), their sentiments have shifted significantly between July and November 2022 [10:44:05, 10:49:02, 10:53:02, 11:11:02, 11:25:06]. After a series of military defeats, including the loss of Kherson, these "Turbo Patriots" are disappointed in the army and Putin [11:29:02, 11:31:07, 11:34:02, 11:38:08, 11:40:07]. Some are even willing to sacrifice new territories for the sake of peace, as they see no sense in the cost of these acquisitions [11:48:03, 11:53:01, 12:05:01, 12:09:07]. This reflects a "fog of war" clearing their brains [11:55:07, 11:57:08, 12:00:00].

This changing mood, even among staunch supporters, suggests that the [[internal_political_situation_in_russia | internal political situation in Russia]] is worsening for the authorities [12:24:05, 12:27:06, 12:30:01, 12:37:06]. Putin's popularity is reportedly at record lows, and [[social_unrest_and_potential_for_protest_in_russia | public discontent]] is increasing [12:43:08, 12:47:04, 12:49:06]. This explains Putin's repeated assurances that there will be no [[potential_mobilization_and_public_dissent_in_russia | mobilization]], as people are under stress and expect negative surprises from the government [12:51:06, 13:00:04, 13:03:00, 13:09:04, 13:12:00].

## Government Response and Elite Behavior

The government's strategy to cope with [[current_state_of_political_and_social_issues_in_russia | rising discontent]] is evident in the federal budget for 2023-2025 [13:24:04, 13:27:01, 13:31:00]. While tax revenues are expected to decrease by 5% and oil and gas revenues by 24%, there is a record jump in financing for security forces (police, National Guard, FSB, Federal Protective Service) [13:36:06, 13:39:07, 13:41:03, 13:44:02, 13:46:04, 13:52:02, 13:58:02, 14:02:00]. Every third ruble will go to these forces, with a quarter of the budget classified [14:04:06, 14:07:07, 14:11:00, 14:14:04]. This approach is characterized as "sitting on bayonets," a strategy that can only last a very short time [14:16:04, 14:20:00, 14:22:04, 14:30:00, 14:34:04].

The [[impact_of_political_changes_in_russia | changing behavior of the Russian establishment]] is also notable [15:59:00, 16:02:07]. Officials within political institutions are reportedly increasing their alcohol consumption, often starting with breakfast, and adding substances to help them forget the "terrible present" and "even more terrible prospects" [16:13:00, 16:20:00, 16:23:00, 16:27:00, 16:29:05, 16:40:00, 16:42:00, 16:45:00]. This increase in alcohol consumption among officials, which President Putin reportedly views with great dissatisfaction, is seen as a coping mechanism for stress [16:58:00, 17:03:00, 17:05:00, 17:34:00, 17:37:00, 17:42:00, 17:46:00].

Furthermore, rumors suggest that Russian officials are actively seeking "a second homeland" or "bases" abroad to "lie low after the regime collapses" [18:08:00, 18:10:00, 18:12:00, 18:15:00, 18:21:00]. While Latin America is often mentioned, it is considered unsafe due to the predominant US influence [18:31:00, 18:34:00, 18:36:00, 18:38:00, 18:40:00, 18:43:00, 18:46:00, 18:48:00]. For top officials, true safety is unlikely there, as the American state machine can reach them anywhere [19:04:00, 19:06:00, 19:07:00, 19:10:00, 19:13:00]. Instead, real "bases" or "alternate airfields" with luxury housing, material resources (currencies, precious metals), and protection are being created in Africa [19:19:00, 19:22:00, 19:24:00, 19:40:00, 19:42:00, 19:45:00, 19:48:00, 19:51:00, 19:54:00]. The Wagner private military company, known for its successful operations in Africa, contributes to this protection [19:58:00, 20:01:00, 20:04:00, 20:07:00, 20:10:00, 20:12:00, 20:14:00, 20:17:00].

The [[political_situation_in_russia | overall situation]] for the Russian elite appears largely hopeless, as they can no longer count on military victory or widespread public support, nor do they have a safe place to flee [20:31:00, 20:33:00, 20:36:00, 20:39:00, 20:42:00, 20:44:00, 20:46:00, 20:49:00].

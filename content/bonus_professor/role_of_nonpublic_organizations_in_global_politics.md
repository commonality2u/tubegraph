The current socio-political landscape in Russia is characterized by a significant increase in the influence of occult and mystical beliefs among the elite, impacting both domestic and [[international_relations_and_the_involvement_of_russian_figures | foreign policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This trend, described as a "black mass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, reflects a broader shift towards the "new Middle Ages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>, where traditional political and economic instruments are perceived as ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.

## Occultism within the Russian Elite
The pervasive occult and esoteric hobbies within the Russian establishment are connected to a "fear of [Putin's] death" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, leading to attempts to "domesticate this fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> or to "prolong and be healed or get some bonus of the afterlife directly by Putin himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This has become a "current trend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a> that power-integrated individuals feel compelled to follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

### Pyramids and Elite Hobbies
The construction of pyramids across Russia, particularly near Tomsk, is cited as a symptom of this occult fervor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. One such object near Tomsk is linked to "Prigogine's businessmen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, with the architect Valery Uvarov having designed a spa and salon reportedly owned by [[the_role_of_prigozhin_and_wagner_group_in_political_landscape | Prigozhin's]] spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. These pyramids are believed to be "endowed with mystical power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> and are seen as either tombs or mystical tools for power and longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

> [!tip] Historical Context of Pyramids
> An archaeological expedition in the late 1980s discovered Bronze Age graves near Tomsk containing "inventory items related to the Egyptian culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, which may have influenced the location choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Ancient Egyptian pyramids, particularly the three great pyramids and the sphinx, are increasingly attributed to an "older civilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, while step pyramids in Mesoamerica were used for mystical rites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Putin's Engagement with Mysticism
Putin himself has engaged in "very strange non-Christian rites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, including rituals for his health and for "the induction of damage mine damage and evil oil not a knot on his enemies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Early in his management, he sought predictions from three fortune tellers, two of whom were outside of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. All three gave "almost identical predictions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>: he would rule for 20 years, but "the end of the reign will be terrible if he cannot change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. These predictions, though extensive, were delivered without the final paragraph, which contained cryptic phrases like "all twelve turn away you and then I will choose the king be afraid of part of the southern ruler of poisons husband of the state southern ruler head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. Noteworthy "southern rulers" mentioned in this context include Milosevic, Mubarak, and Gaddafi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

> [!quote] Thomas Theorem
> The speaker emphasizes that "it's important how it is perceived by those people who turned to predictions and who became guided by these predictions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, referring to the Thomas theorem where beliefs, even if false, can lead to real consequences.

The increasing occult component in the Russian government is linked to Putin's "fading age" and a perceived "loss of luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>, particularly since August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. This has created a "feeling of extreme nervousness and very anxious... pride panic or semi-panic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a> among those who traditionally communicated with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

## Non-Public Organizations and Political Influence
The article highlights the significant, albeit hidden, role of non-public organizations in shaping politics. These include:
*   **Occult Orders**: The transcript mentions "13 great world occult orders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:51">[00:50:51]</a> which "have a state of insurmountable contradictions" with Russia due to a perceived "insult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a> and fundamental disagreements on principles like freedom, enlightenment, and knowledge without censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:52">[01:01:52]</a>. These orders are described as political subjects with adherents and supporters in various governments, including the Russian and Western ones, influencing "tough tone[s]" and "sensitive slaps on the nose" for the Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. A ritual initiated by these orders on June 21, 2020, in Nepal, is cited as a turning point that changed events after that date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **Special Services**: These are also considered non-public organizations that influence politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>.
*   **Religious and quasi-religious groups**: The Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) system is known to Putin from the inside, and while he doesn't harbor illusions about it, he doesn't reject its "main attribute of the miracle of the ROC is power and human remains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>. The use of relics is widespread, despite discrepancies and biblical prohibitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.
*   **Mexican Syncretic Cults**: The Santa Muerte (Holy Death) cult, a blend of Christianity and traditional Mexican beliefs, is prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. Its altars require the skeleton or head of a "powerful person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>, and different varieties of the cult serve different purposes: Black Death for career growth, Golden Death for wealth, and White Death for worldly goods like love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. These practices are gaining popularity in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, with adherents spending large sums of money for these "miracles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.
*   **Shamans and Fortune Tellers**: The Russian establishment turns to various shamans (from Khakassia, Tuva, Altai Mountains, and even the Amazon delta) and fortune tellers (tarot readers, astrologers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. These practices are considered a "fashion" and a form of "group identity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>. They represent an attempt to "change reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:59">[00:42:59]</a> when conventional political and economic tools fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.

> [!example] Kirsan Ilyumzhinov and Aliens
> Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, former head of Kalmykia, claims to have visited an "inter-space interplanetary ship with aliens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:02">[00:33:02]</a> in 1997, and discussed this on BBC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. This instance is cited as an example of the kind of unconventional beliefs held by some powerful figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>.

## Geopolitical Implications
The increasing reliance on occultism and mysticism by the Russian elite is linked to their perceived inability to influence reality with conventional tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>. This has led to a "great demand for a miracle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>, as the establishment faces a "feeling of hopelessness, lack of prospects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a> and fears the collapse of their system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:37">[00:59:37]</a>. The shift in behavior is observable, with individuals striving to imitate the "first overlord" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:56">[00:37:56]</a> (Putin) in their choice of exotic cults or fashionable shamans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>. This situation is compared to the "new Middle Ages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>, where "people poison themselves with poisons... the government participates in dense black magic rituals, worships the remains of the dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:13">[01:09:13]</a>.

> [!quote] The "New Middle Ages"
> "We live in a new Middle Ages, people poison themselves with poisons, like in the era of Alexander I, the government participates in dense black magic rituals, worships the remains of the dead, well, tell me, friends, isn't this the Middle Ages?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>

Valery Solovey, during the 42nd edition of "Answers to Hot Questions" on December 14, discusses the influence of Nikolai and Dmitry Patrushev within the context of a "transit scheme" for Russian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Nikolai Patrushev's Current Role

Nikolai Patrushev is described as "actually the supreme ruler of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. His current position is the result of a "broad compromise and agreement of a broad coalition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, which is noted as a "temporary agreement" and "temporary compromise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. This broad coalition is composed of "several elite groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. These [[role_and_influence_of_key_russian_political_figures_and_coalitions | elite groups]] are keen to observe how Nikolai Patrushev conducts affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. They are "in no hurry to change the supreme power right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, primarily because they know more about Nikolai Patrushev than the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. It is suggested that these [[role_and_influence_of_key_russian_political_figures_and_coalitions | elite groups]] will attempt to "replay this game," referring to the current agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

If a "double" of the president were to be elected, he would be "under complete absolute control" of Nikolai Patrushev and "will not be allowed to even squeak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This double would be obliged to appoint Dmitry Patrushev as prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Dmitry Patrushev's Potential Role

There are questions regarding Dmitry Patrushev's potential role as prime minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The [[role_and_influence_of_key_russian_political_figures_and_coalitions | elite groups]] are also interested in seeing how Dmitry Patrushev "will conduct business" if he "becomes prime minister" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Regarding whether Dmitry Patrushev would be a suitable leader, the speaker states that "anyone can rule better than a dead person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>, implying a preference for a leader elected through "fair competitive elections" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. Dmitry Patrushev is characterized as "flesh and blood" of those who "robbed Russia" and were "beneficiaries of this robbery," and that they "all must answer according to the law and in fairness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

## Elite Dynamics and Future Prospects

The current power arrangement is a result of a "broad compromise" among various [[role_and_influence_of_key_russian_political_figures_and_coalitions | elite groups]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. These groups are cautious and prefer to observe the Patrushevs' conduct before making permanent changes to supreme power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. The speaker is confident that these groups will attempt to "replay this game" and challenge the current agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The prevailing consensus among the [[role_and_influence_of_key_russian_political_figures_and_coalitions | elite groups]] is that the ongoing situation is "acceptable" or "optimal" for their interests, even if "unacceptable" for the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

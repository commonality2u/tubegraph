From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 
The production of "information noise" refers to the creation of numerous discussion points that may have insignificant or zero factual basis, filling the information field without genuinely affecting the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This contrasts with "events," which genuinely impact current or future situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The primary producer of this "information garbage" is identified as [[vladimir_putins_public_speeches_and_contradictions|Vladimir Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Examples of Information Noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>

Recent instances of what is categorized as "information noise" include:
*   [[vladimir_putins_public_speeches_and_contradictions|Putin]]'s speech in Ulan-Ude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   [[vladimir_putins_public_speeches_and_contradictions|Putin]]'s speech before the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   Alleged trips to Crimea and Mariupol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

Of these, only the speech to industrialists and entrepreneurs in the House of Music involved [[vladimir_putins_public_speeches_and_contradictions|Putin]] personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Use of Doubles in Information Noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
In other "information events," a [[putins_doubles_and_their_future|double of Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin]] was the key figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This includes appearances in Ulan-Ude, at the helicopter plant, in Crimea, and during the night trip to Mariupol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The presence of [[putins_doubles_and_their_future|Putin's doubles]] used in significant areas, specifically for "noise production," is widely acknowledged abroad and no longer doubted in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. However, some Russians, particularly TV viewers, find it difficult to accept that [[vladimir_putins_public_speeches_and_contradictions|their president]] could have doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

The speaker notes that [[vladimir_putins_public_speeches_and_contradictions|Vladimir Vladimirovich]] would never put himself in a situation of even hypothetical danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The double can even appear physically better than the real [[vladimir_putins_public_speeches_and_contradictions|Russian president]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Their sense of humor is described as "soldier's humor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The only instance [[vladimir_putins_public_speeches_and_contradictions|Putin]] personally appeared was before businessmen, as many people there know him, and his absence would have been "indecent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. During this appearance, [[vladimir_putins_public_speeches_and_contradictions|Putin]] was described as being "on speed" or "on very strong stimulants," which "revived, but not in the right direction, his mental activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Impact of Information Noise
All these "information reasons" did not and could not affect the real situation in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Industrialists and entrepreneurs left [[vladimir_putins_public_speeches_and_contradictions|Putin]]'s speech "extremely disappointed" as they did not receive answers to their concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Many wealthy Russian business figures intentionally did not attend the meeting to avoid future sanctions, indicating that [[vladimir_putins_public_speeches_and_contradictions|Putin]] is now seen as a "leper" and a "toxic asset" whom they avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

### Contrast with Real Events
In contrast to information noise, real "events" are those that significantly affect the situation. Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, for instance, is considered a genuine event that will impact Russian domestic and potentially foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Another significant event discussed is the International Criminal Court's issuance of a warrant for [[vladimir_putins_public_speeches_and_contradictions|Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin]] for suspicion of committing war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

A [[strategic_turning_point_in_ukraine_conflict | strategic turning point]] in favor of Ukraine has begun, or rather been finally consolidated, in the [[ukraine_russia_conflict_and_strategic_turning_points | military campaign]] between [[Russia Ukraine conflict | Russia and Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This assessment comes after the withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson and the subsequent arrival of Ukrainian armed forces there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Sensational news, confirmed by multiple trustworthy sources, further supports this analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Peace Proposal to the Kremlin

On Thursday, November 10, the Kremlin received a peace deal offer with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This proposal, agreed upon with the Ukrainian leadership, is described as an offer for the capitulation of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Key Conditions of the Proposal

The essence of the proposal includes several demands and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>:
*   **Territorial Withdrawal** The Russian armed forces must completely leave Ukraine, including the territories of the DPR and LPR, which Russia had previously declared as subjects of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Crimea Status** The status of Crimea is to be suspended for seven years, during which it will not be discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The peninsula itself will be declared a demilitarized zone, allowing only police and border guards with small arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The Black Sea Fleet must leave Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Demilitarized Zone** A 100-kilometer wide demilitarized strip will be introduced along Russia's borders with Ukraine and Belarus, with no heavy weapons allowed in this strip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Guarantors** Six countries have agreed to act as guarantors of this agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Transnistria** Russia must leave Transnistria, implying the withdrawal of the Russian military base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. In 2023, Transnistria is to be included and integrated into Moldova, and Russia undertakes not to interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Ukraine's NATO Pledge** Ukraine promises not to join NATO for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Russian Establishment's Reaction and Putin's Dilemma

The initial reaction from the Russian establishment to this ultimatum has been positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This is attributed to the fact that the offer of capitulation guarantees freedom and security to the establishment, including security forces, ensuring that criminal cases will not be brought against them or their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. They are also promised the preservation of at least part of their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

President Putin's reaction is still unclear, as he is currently considering the proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Refusal** If massive missile attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure, particularly power plants, are resumed, it signifies an unambiguous refusal of these conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Acceptance** If there is no shelling, it doesn't necessarily mean readiness to accept, but that reflection continues, and an attempt is being made to gain additional time to comprehend the situation and hope for a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### Consequences of Refusal

If the president refuses these conditions, which the Russian establishment is prepared to accept, military action will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This continuation makes a military defeat of the Russian Federation highly probable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Putin's only way to delay this defeat would be to use a nuclear threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. However, in light of the favorable conditions offered to the establishment, the chances increase that an order to use tactical nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction would be blocked or not carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Such an outcome would effectively mean the end of Vladimir Putin's de facto presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Putin's Inevitable Departure

Regardless of the strategic decision President Putin makes, he will have to leave power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   If Putin accepts the ultimatum, he will likely go into the shadows to save face and shift responsibility to another person who would sign the agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This carries the risk of a palace coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   If he decides to continue the military campaign hoping for a miracle, he will inevitably become a scapegoat for its defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### Historical Analogy

This [[current_phase_of_the_russian_ukraine_conflict | sharp turn]] in Russian politics, encompassing both international and internal aspects, signifies a complete and final fiasco of 22 years of Putin's rule and system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. A close historical analogy is Russia's defeat in the Crimean War (1853-1856), where Emperor Nicholas I, who initially believed in the army's absolute victory, effectively caused his own death after realizing the defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

The speaker expresses that while living in history is fascinating as an intellectual, it is terribly scary as a citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Despite the current difficulties, there is a strong belief that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

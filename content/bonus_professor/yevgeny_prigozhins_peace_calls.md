In mid-April 2023, [[return_of_yevgeny_prigozhin_to_russia | Yevgeny Prigozhin]], head of the Wagner Group, made public calls for peace and a truce in the conflict with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. These calls were noted by Valery Solovey on April 16, 2023, as a significant topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

## Context and Motivation

Prigozhin's appeals, made around April 16, 2023, were interpreted as a sign of fear regarding the anticipated Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. His message suggested that "the task has already been completed" and that a truce should be concluded along the existing front line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. This was seen as a recognition of the high likelihood that the status quo could change rapidly and decisively in Ukraine's favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

The General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces reportedly believed the Ukrainian offensive would be successful, with questions only about its scale and depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. Prigozhin's calls were considered a preventative measure, urging an agreement for at least a truce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>.

### Expressing Establishment Mood
Prigozhin's statements were seen as expressing the mood of the Russian establishment, which reportedly understood that the situation was deteriorating for Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. The establishment, feeling "cornered," desired to preserve their assets and social standing rather than face defeat with the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

### Self-Promotion
Beyond political and military motivations, Prigozhin's calls were also recognized as excellent self-promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. His statements became the number one news item, surpassing those of other prominent figures like Peskov or Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

## Reception of the Calls

Prigozhin himself was understood to know that neither the Kremlin nor Kyiv would respond to his calls for a truce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. Ukrainians and their Western allies were confident that the conflict's outcome would be decided on the battlefield, most likely in Ukraine's favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. The belief in Ukraine's success was significantly higher than in the Russian Armed Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.

## Public Opinion on Peace
A Levada Center poll from March (results available in April 2023) indicated that the armed confrontation in Ukraine, including the conflict with the West and sanctions, was only the second biggest concern for Russian society, worrying 33% of respondents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. This was a "colossal" gap compared to rising prices, which worried 58% of Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>. This suggests that the fighting in Ukraine was not the primary concern for the general Russian public, who were more focused on domestic economic issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.

Leri Solovey hosts a "dog day program" on Thursdays at 1:00 PM Moscow time, where he answers "hot questions" left in the comments of his Monday YouTube releases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. He emphasizes that he addresses the most important, relevant, interesting, and sometimes funny questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Current Developments in the Russian Elite

### Detention of Timur Ivanov
The detention of Timur Ivanov is a frequently asked question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Solovey notes that he previously spoke about the upcoming detentions of figures like Ivanov and certain deputy ministers of defense or internal affairs before the New Year and in February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. On February 15, under the title "The Burning Issue Under the Carpet," he discussed the planned removal of all or almost all deputy defense ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This is part of a plan to update the department, increase efficiency, and punish those responsible for failures, mistakes, and abuses committed before and after February 24, 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This information was shared over two months before Ivanov's detention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Fate of Sergei Shoigu
The fate of Sergei Shoigu is being actively discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. On February 15, Solovey predicted that Shoigu would be removed from his post and become the head of the Russian Guard, replacing General Zolotov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This move is seen not just as a "show resignation" but as a "mockery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Later, in March, the opinion of those governing Russia, particularly Nikolai Patrushev, shifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Shoigu is not opposed to leaving his current position, even amidst the ongoing "purge" of "Ministry barons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Kadyrov's Health and Chechnya's Future
Ramzan Kadyrov is genuinely ill with a "very serious illness," though it is not fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Solovey's information on the cause and diagnosis of his illness differs from what has been published by *Novaya Gazeta Evropa* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The question of succession for Kadyrov is not a practical issue at this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. There is no truth to the rumor that Kadyrov wants to be appointed Minister of Internal Affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

In the event of [[potential_changes_in_russian_leadership_and_implications | leadership changes]] in Russia, a conflict with Chechnya is considered "extremely unlikely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The relationship between Chechnya and the central government would likely develop differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. If faced with a choice between war and "free floating" (independence), the latter would likely be preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Dagestan's future is a separate question, with the speaker emphasizing that Dagestan itself must decide its path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. The current issue is the quality of management, not the ethnicity of managers, particularly regarding corruption, violence, and poverty in regions like Dagestan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

### Medvedev's Behavior
Dmitry Medvedev's aggressive rhetoric, such as calling for thousands of foreign agents to be imprisoned, is likened to the psychotype of an "alcoholic, raging at the counters" whom "no one wants to listen to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>.

## Prospects for [[possible_future_political_changes_in_russia | Political Change in Russia]]

### Acute Political Crisis
There is a "high probability of an acute [[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_russia | political crisis]] this fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. This is viewed as a "fatal decision or a fatal fork" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

### Legitimacy of Power and New Republic
All legislative acts and regulatory documents signed by "the double" (referring to a supposed double of Putin) will be "legally null and void" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This will "finally and irrevocably" undermine the legitimacy of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. The speaker has stated many times that the crisis in Russia will result in a "complete final break with the previous legitimacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Legally, it will be a revolution, though it may not be a social or political revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. A new Russian Republic will be established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

### Impact on Ordinary Citizens and Businesses
For ordinary citizens, the crisis will primarily manifest as a "disorganization of public life" and a "weakening of functions of the state and municipal government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>. While there might be temporary interruptions in electricity, gas, or water supply, these will not be long-lasting, and there will be no ultimate deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. The crisis is about the "disintegration of the state fabric" and the "creation of a new state fabric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:36">[00:40:36]</a>.

For small entrepreneurs, particularly those in the grocery business, a crisis situation often proves "extremely favorable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. The advice is to seize opportunities immediately: "never put off until tomorrow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This advice also applies to personal development, such as studying or improving skills, despite fears like large-scale mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

### Private Property and Officials
There are no plans for "wild dreams" such as nationalizing all private companies, especially small and medium businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:55">[00:40:55]</a>. The plan is to preserve small and medium businesses, while large businesses and "strategic industries" will be transferred to the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.

Upon coming to power, the speaker's team does not plan to "retrain officials and security officials" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>. Instead, those who fall under "chandelier law enforcement" (corrupt or criminal) will be unable to work in law enforcement or civil/municipal service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. Otherwise, all other spheres are open to them, and they can try to retrain themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.

### Return of Prigozhin
Yevgeny Prigozhin is believed to have "someone to take revenge for" and "something to take revenge for" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. He will return and seek revenge, and those close to him are awaiting his return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>.

### Future of Pensions and Mineral Wealth
The funded part of pensions will be returned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, provided for by the new pension program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Indigenous people of Russia, not just in the third generation, will receive interest from the sale of minerals, like in the United Arab Emirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. This will be implemented in the current lifetime and serve as Russia's "reserve fund," as the "best reserve is our people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. The speaker's team believes it can significantly increase pensions within a year after the change of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

### National Policy and Identity
The speaker's rhetoric containing "nationalistic notes" is explained by the idea that the well-being of Russia depends "first of all on how Russians feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. Russians are described as the "overwhelming majority and the truly state-forming people of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. However, this does not mean that the well-being of Russians should come at the expense of other nations; "all animals will be equal for us" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

## External Relations and Geopolitics

### US Assistance to Ukraine
Regarding US assistance to Ukraine, the speaker clarifies that he never stated the US was unwilling to provide aid due to nuclear strike fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Instead, he always emphasized that assistance would be provided, with the main question being whether it would arrive too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The US aims to prevent Russia from defeating Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Restoration of Relations with the West
The "preliminary basic condition" for restoring relations with the West is a "peace treaty or a truce followed by a peace treaty with Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:33">[00:29:33]</a>. This treaty must "more or less meet both Ukraine's expectations and the West's expectations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:46">[00:29:46]</a>. If this precondition is met, relations with the West could be restored "fairly quickly," possibly within 2-3 years, almost fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

### Geopolitical Influence
Currently, Russia's geopolitical prospects in Europe and Central Asia are not significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>. However, with a new government in Russia and the fulfillment of the conditions for peace, Russia will "intensively build a new paradigm of relations with the world and with itself," leading to improved relations with the West, Europe, and Central Asia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

### End of Hostilities
There are "very serious reasons" to believe that by the end of this year, there will be either a peace treaty or peace negotiations leading to a truce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>. This is considered "very, very likely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.

### US Global Hegemony
The United States will "certainly remain a hegemon" globally, although they will face an "increasing wave of problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.

### "World Government" and Non-Public Organizations
The concept of a "world government" does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>. However, there are "non-public organizations" (less than a dozen and a half) that "exert a very significant influence on the global economy and global politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>. These organizations influence through people they bring into government, top managers or owners of corporations, intellectual trusts, and advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. They generally operate in a state of "positive neutrality," supporting each other and working to maintain global balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:47">[00:33:47]</a>. They played a positive role by not speaking out against the late President Putin, which would have led to "much worse" outcomes for Europe and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.

## Conclusion
The crisis is "no longer just on the doorstep; it has already entered us" and "will develop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:35">[00:46:35]</a>. It cannot be stopped, and people will have to survive it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. Despite the difficulties, the speaker is confident that "Victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:47">[00:46:47]</a>.

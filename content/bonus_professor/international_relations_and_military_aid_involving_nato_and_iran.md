This article discusses military aid to Ukraine from [[potential_involvement_of_nato_in_the_conflict | NATO]] countries and allies, and military assistance to Russia from Iran, as well as broader [[international_relations_and_cooperation | international relations]] affecting the parties involved in the [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | Ukraine conflict]].

## Military Aid to Ukraine

According to President Biden, Ukraine is expected to receive significant military assistance from [[potential_involvement_of_nato_in_the_conflict | NATO]] countries and allies in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This aid package includes:
*   2,000 tanks and other armored vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>
*   More than 800 artillery systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   Over 2 million shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>
*   Multiple launch rocket systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>

This [[international_military_assistance_to_ukraine | military assistance]] is deemed necessary for Ukraine to launch a strategic offensive aimed at reaching its state borders with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Iran's Military Support for Russia

Russia is reportedly seeking new weapons systems from Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The head of Israeli Mossad made a public statement indicating this expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Primarily, this refers to ballistic missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

It is alleged that the first batch of ballistic missiles was to be transferred from Iran to the Russian Federation even before the New Year, with further shipments expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This operation is likely to be denied by both Russia and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## China's Stance and Economic Measures

The Bloomberg Newsletter, a prominent economic news agency, reported that China's Koshi, the world's largest sea transportation operator, ceased transporting oil from Russia as of December 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. This decision followed the introduction of a price cap on oil and other restrictions on Russian oil exports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. A Greek sea transportation company has also announced a similar boycott <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. This demonstrates that China is not only demanding reports but also imposing its will on the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

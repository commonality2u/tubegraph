On Monday, October 30, at 1:00 PM, a program was released focusing on the alleged [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | death of Vladimir Putin]] and the subsequent formation of a new reality in Russia [00:00:36].

## The Alleged Death and New Reality

According to Valery Solovey, the [[possibility_of_putins_death_and_its_implications | death of Vladimir Putin]] occurred on October 26 [00:00:49]. This event is presented as an "irrefutable fundamental medical and anthropological fact" [00:01:01]. The body of the deceased president is reportedly in a frozen state at his residence in Valdai [00:01:05].

Nikolai Patrushev is currently performing the role of Russia's de facto ruler, heading his group and forming a broad coalition [00:01:13]. The Russian president is being temporarily replaced by a physical double [00:01:21]. This temporary period is expected to last a couple of months, certainly not a year or a decade [00:01:26].

### Personal Sentiment on Putin's Death

The speaker expresses deep satisfaction with [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | Putin's death]], stating that Putin "kicked the bucket and that's where he belongs" [00:01:47]. He denies accusations of inhumanity, asserting that Putin "was never a human being" [00:01:58], comparing him to an "anthropomorphic creature" with as much humanity as a "crocodile cannibal" [00:02:02]. The speaker argues that Putin "ate the lives and destinies of hundreds of thousands and millions of people" [00:02:19], which justifies treating him as he deserves [00:02:27]. Mourning his death is deemed unnecessary; rather, one should mourn his birth [00:02:30].

## Formation of a New Reality

The time has come for everyone to adapt to a "new reality" â€“ a post-[[speculation_on_putins_health_and_the_future_of_putinism | Putin]] reality forming before their eyes [00:02:40]. Crucially, this new reality is being formed with the participation of individuals [00:02:47]. Two main aspects of this new reality are highlighted: the informational-psychological and the political [00:02:57].

### Informational-Psychological Aspect

The primary informational-psychological development is the spread of the topic of [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | Putin's death]] through media and human consciousness [00:03:07]. This spread is attributed to the Telegram channel "General SVR," the speaker's posts and videos, and widespread reposting and discussion [00:03:17].

*   **Rapid Dissemination**: The news of [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | Putin's death]] reportedly spread across all of Russia and the world in about two days, a "brilliant result" given the limited initial resources [00:03:34].
*   **Inclusion in Consciousness**: The importance lies not just in notification, but in the psychological development of the topic and its inclusion in human consciousness [00:03:55]. Whether people believe in [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | Putin's death]] or not, the discussion itself signifies the formation of a "new psychological reality" [00:04:11]. This reality means that even skeptics assume "something is still wrong here" [00:04:33].
*   **Delegitimization through Humor**: The process of "delegitimizing the topic" is evident in the emergence of numerous jokes, caricatures, and internet memes [00:05:06]. The late president is now referred to as "the man from the refrigerator," an "absolutely accurate" and humiliating description of his concealed life and death [00:05:17]. An anecdote describes him "lying and shaking so finely, apparently like aspic" in a refrigerator [00:05:49].
*   **Lack of Public Sympathy**: Despite a "gigantic, unprecedented number of trolls" [00:06:04] on the speaker's videos and accounts, no "single human word of sympathy for Putin" has been observed [00:06:20]. Comments are either denials of his death or expressions of a desire for a "Great Putin," but none show human empathy, which is considered "very characteristic" and "symptomatic" of how he will be remembered [00:06:31].
*   **Critique of Official Evidence**: The speaker questions the demand for official evidence of [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | Putin's death]], such as statements from Press Secretary Peskov, recalling Peskov's denial of the 2022 invasion of Ukraine [00:07:01]. He also challenges the belief in official statements regarding [[potential_return_of_prigozhin_and_speculation_on_putins_death | Prigozhin's death]], highlighting that such claims are unreliable [00:08:04]. A medical report on [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | Putin's death]] reportedly exists and will be presented "at the right time" [00:07:40].
*   **Future Confirmation**: Assurance is given that many facts, confirmations, and human testimonies will emerge to convince everyone that "fundamental reality has changed" [00:08:31].

### Political Aspect of the New Reality

Beyond the informational and psychological shifts, a new political reality is also taking shape [00:09:00].

*   **State Crime**: The current state of affairs, where Nikolai Patrushev rules and a double replaces the former president, is defined as a "state crime" under Article 357 of the Criminal Code, involving "conspiracy, purpose of capture or retention of power and seizure or retention of power by unconstitutional means" [00:09:13]. Those forming the new government and redistributing portfolios, knowing what happened, are considered "state criminals" [00:09:49].
*   **Demonstration of Strength in North Caucasus**: Events in the North Caucasus, such as Ramzan Kadyrov's Chechnya receiving heavy weapons from the Russian Guard and forming battalions [00:10:45], along with the Makhachkala riots [00:11:26], are seen as demonstrations of strength by members of the coalition under Patrushev [00:11:37]. These actions serve as a threat to stability, signaling boundaries not to be crossed by the new government [00:11:57].
*   **Russia's Shift in Foreign Policy**: A notable feature is Russia's withdrawal from supporting Palestinians [00:13:13]. This shift resulted from behind-the-scenes negotiations following a call from Netanyahu, who "blackmailed bluntly" that he would reveal the secret of the Russian president's health status at that time, when he was "still alive but deeply unwell" [00:14:02].
*   **Impending Government Appointments**: New government appointments are anticipated soon, reflecting the new balance of power and the crystallization of a new government configuration [00:14:37]. These appointments will further confirm the message that [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | Putin is no longer alive]] [00:15:07].

## Call to Action and Participation

The speaker emphasizes that individuals can and already partly do participate in the formation of this new reality [00:16:00]. Ways to help include:
*   Reposting information [00:16:45].
*   Liking videos on channels like General SVR and My Doctor Nightingale [00:16:51].
*   Providing material support, with assurance that the information provided over the years has been reliable [00:17:12].

The speaker concludes with a strong conviction that "victory will be ours" [00:18:35] as people navigate this new post-[[speculation_on_putins_health_and_the_future_of_putinism | Putin]] reality, hoping to live like human beings in the foreseeable future [00:15:29].

Russian state propaganda is characterized as a powerful machine that instills hatred and creates a state of "absolute and sinister delusion" within a significant part of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. It is described as "hostile to everything human, everything honest, everything fair, everything humane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Impact of Propaganda

The primary [[impact_of_propaganda_on_russian_society | impact of political propaganda in Russia]] is the "zombification" of a portion of the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This [[impact_of_propaganda_on_russian_society | propaganda and public sentiment in Russia]] is so pervasive that it leads people to accept "ready-made formulas" as a way to conserve energy, even when faced with obvious realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. Even significant events, such as changes in the Ministry of Defense or major political shifts, are dismissed by a considerable group of people who choose to remain oblivious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:05">[00:33:05]</a>. This phenomenon is likened to a "cognitive error" where people struggle to imagine a future different from the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.

## Countering Propaganda

To address the [[impact_of_propaganda_and_media_sources_in_russia | media manipulation and political narratives in Russia]], the initial step involves "switching off the state propaganda machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This immediate cessation, coupled with the introduction of "other narratives" through television, is expected to lead a significant portion of society to "come to its senses" within a relatively short period, approximately up to six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This approach aims to change the "climate in the country from malignant to benign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Media Censorship

Currently, laws allow for the blocking of various internet resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. However, upon a change in power, the immediate repeal of these laws concerning the blocking of internet resources is planned to be done "virtually automatically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. This would allow for greater [[media_censorship_and_freedom_of_information_in_russia | freedom of information in Russia]].

## Public Opinion

The speaker notes that [[public_opinion_and_its_impact_on_russian_political_dynamics | public opinion]] in the "new territories controlled by Russia" is obvious when judged by common sense rather than propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. Despite the pervasive influence of propaganda, there is a "huge request" in Russian society for democratic and liberal values such as equality, a functioning court, competition, freedom of movement, and competitive elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. This desire is rooted in the fact that "no one wants to live in poverty, lack of rights and dispa," except for "a group of perverts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. All "normal people" desire the implementation of these values, even if they do not explicitly label them as democratic or liberal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

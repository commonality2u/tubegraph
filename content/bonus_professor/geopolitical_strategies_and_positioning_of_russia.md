This article outlines various aspects of [[Russian political and military strategies | Russian political and military strategies]] and its [[Geopolitical tensions and Russias international relationships | international relationships]], based on recent discussions and predictions.

## Internal Affairs and Military Restructuring

### Defense Ministry Purge
A major purge is underway within the Russian Ministry of Defense, which includes the detention of Timur Ivanov and anticipated removals of other deputy ministers of defense and internal affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This aligns with plans discussed before the New Year and in February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. On February 15, it was stated that all or almost all deputy defense ministers would be removed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This is part of a strategy to update the department, increase its efficiency, and punish those responsible for failures, mistakes, and abuses committed before and after February 24, 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

### Sergei Shoigu's Fate
It was predicted that Sergei Shoigu would be removed from his post as Minister of Defense and become the head of the Russian Guard instead of General Zolotov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. This move was described as a "show resignation" and a "mockery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. By March, the opinion of those governing [[Strategic situation of the Russian Federation | Russia]], particularly Nikolai Patrushev, changed, and Shoigu is now reportedly not against leaving his current position despite the ongoing purge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

### Kadyrov's Health and Succession
Ramzan Kadyrov is confirmed to be seriously ill, though his illness is not considered fatal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. Information on his diagnosis differs from that published by Novaya Gazeta Evropa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. The question of succession for Kadyrov is currently not a practical issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. It is untrue that Kadyrov wishes to be appointed Minister of Internal Affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>. A conflict between [[Strategic situation of the Russian Federation | Russia]] and Chechnya in the event of a change in [[Strategic situation of the Russian Federation | Russia]]'s leadership is considered extremely unlikely, with relations expected to develop differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

### Dagestan's Future
Regarding Dagestan, if a choice arises between war and "free floating" (autonomy), the latter is likely preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. The question of Dagestan being ruled by Russian protégés and generals who accumulate negative sentiment among the local populace highlights issues of corruption, violence, and poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. The core issue is the quality of management, not the ethnicity of the manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

### Medvedev's Aggression
Dmitry Medvedev's aggressive rhetoric, including calls to imprison and increase the number of foreign agents, is attributed to his personal psychotype, compared to an "alcoholic raging at the counters" whom no one wants to listen to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:34:00">[43:34:00]</a>.

## External Relations and Conflicts

### US Aid to Ukraine
The United States has provided assistance to Ukraine, although there were delays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. The speaker had always emphasized that this assistance would be provided, with the main concern being whether it would arrive in time for Ukraine to effectively resist [[Russian political and military strategies | Russian armed forces]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. The US aims to prevent the [[Russian political and military strategies | Russian Federation]] from defeating Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. This assistance has arrived "almost on time" or "really on time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

### Conflict with Baltic Countries
A military operation by the [[Russian political and military strategies | Russian Federation]] against the Baltic countries is tentatively scheduled for the turn of summer or fall this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:54">[02:27:54]</a>. The operation is expected to be brief, lasting only a couple of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. An announcement will be made when the preparatory stage begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

### Prospects for Peace and Geopolitical Influence
There is a high probability of a peace treaty or peace negotiations leading to a truce by the end of this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

The current [[Geopolitical tensions and Russias international relationships | geopolitical influence]] of the [[Russian political and military strategies | Russian Federation]] in Europe and Central Asia is not very significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. However, with a new government in [[Strategic situation of the Russian Federation | Russia]] and the fulfillment of certain conditions, relations with the West could be restored fairly quickly, possibly within 2-3 years, almost in full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. The primary condition for restoring relations with the West is a peace treaty or truce with Ukraine that meets both Ukraine's and the West's expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

## Global Power Dynamics

### United States as Hegemon
The United States is expected to remain a hegemon, despite facing an increasing wave of problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

### Concept of a "World Government"
The notion of a "world government" is dismissed as a matter of faith rather than knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. While no world government exists, there are non-public organizations capable of exerting significant influence on the global economy and politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. There are no more than a dozen and a half such organizations, operating discreetly through individuals in government, top managers, corporation owners, intellectual trusts, and advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. These organizations do not compete but maintain a "positive neutrality," sometimes collaborating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Their role is largely positive, focused on maintaining global balance and preventing excessive violations that could lead to global destruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. They do not constitute a world government or divide spheres of influence, but manage to agree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

### Legitimacy of Power and Putin's Doubles
Statements and legal acts signed by a "double" of Putin are considered legally null and void, which will irrevocably undermine the legitimacy of power in [[Strategic situation of the Russian Federation | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. The eventual outcome will be a complete break with previous legitimacy, described as a legal revolution, leading to the establishment of a new Russian Republic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

### International Recognition of "False Putin"
The recognition of a "false Putin" as legitimate by other countries will have no consequences for the [[Russian political and military strategies | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

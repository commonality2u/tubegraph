Valery Soloviev's YouTube channel, in its 40th episode recorded on November 28, discusses the current state of [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | military operations]] and the prospect of further [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Presidential Rhetoric and Perceived Lack of Empathy

A key event of the past week was President Putin's meeting with mothers, widows, and wives of Russian servicemen participating in special military operations in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This meeting was widely criticized for its "deliberately theatrical nature" and "lowest quality theatricality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Despite "colossal resources" from the presidential administration, the event appeared inflated and poorly directed, with specially selected participants following a "strange scenario" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

A phrase attributed to the President, "What would have been better if they had died from vodka or died in an accident?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, revealed a perceived "complete lack of empathy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This phrase is interpreted as embodying a desire for death and destruction, akin to Freud's concept of Thanatos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. It is suggested that when Putin says "die for the Motherland," he actually means "die for me," viewing himself as the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The core message for those in armed confrontation is "to die for Putin," not to live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Inevitable Offensive and Forthcoming Mobilization

The speaker asserts that the armed confrontation will intensify, with Ukraine having the strategic initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Despite a current "lull" characterized by positional battles, a new offensive from Ukraine is considered "inevitable" as they receive necessary weapons and prepare new units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This inevitability is obvious from the Ukrainian leadership's political and strategic concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

Recognizing this, the Russian leadership is seen as needing a new stage of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. There are "obvious signs" that this is being prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>:
*   A presidential decree was published last week for the creation of an integrated database of military personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   While the database is to be fully ready by April 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, the digitization of military registration and enlistment office data (which is not currently digitized) is scheduled to be completed by December 25, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

This aligns with previous information suggesting a second stage of [[renewed_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] and the introduction of martial law are planned for "after the end of the winter holidays" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Official Denials as Confirmation
A "second indirect confirmation" of these plans comes from the pattern of official denials in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. When officials like Peskov begin to deny something evasively, such as the Kremlin not discussing a second wave of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, it suggests the issue has already been discussed and decided upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. The President's own statements denying the need for further [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] are highlighted as being from "the same person who said that there will be no increase in the retirement age" or "will not change the Constitution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Such denials are presented as "one of the best indirect evidence of existing plans" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## International Relations and Reputation

A DKB summit, attended by Putin, was considered a "negative success" due to Armenian Prime Minister Pashinyan's refusal to sign the final declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This action signals Armenia's potential departure from the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

A striking "image-reputational event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a> was a photograph of Putin with other leaders, showing a noticeably greater distance between Putin and the others compared to the distance among the other participants, suggesting they were "avoiding the president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This photograph was taken shortly after the European Parliament declared Russia a "terrorist state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Although the resolution itself has no immediate practical consequences without further EU decisions, it significantly impacts Russia's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Other leaders wish to avoid association with a "leader of a country of declared terrorists" due to reputational and potential economic concerns (e.g., extended sanctions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This "instinctive reaction" demonstrates a shift among Russia's "loyal vassals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Death of Vladimir Makei
The sudden death of Vladimir Makei, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, initially reported as a heart attack, is claimed by "reliable sources" to have been a murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Makei was allegedly killed for being a "too successful negotiator" in communications between Belarusian leadership and Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. These negotiations hinted at Belarus's readiness for political concessions and a shift towards democracy, aiming to restore relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Makei's murder is seen as blocking this diplomatic path and serving as a "black mark" or "hint" to the Belarusian president about the consequences of refusing "close brotherly embraces" with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Lukashenko is expected to react by keeping a low profile while harboring "evil hatred resentment" towards those preventing him from distancing himself from Russian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

## Public Perception and Anxiety in Russia

Recent sociological surveys reveal a complex picture of public sentiment in Russia. While some surveys indicated a high and growing level of optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>, this is attributed to socially approved answers or a "schizophrenia of consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Fresh sociology shows that the "anxious mood of Russians has grown from 49 to 56 percent" in a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>, seemingly contradicting optimistic views.

A key factor in this divide appears to be the source of information:
*   Optimists primarily rely on television, which portrays a "rich, prosperous Russia" confidently overcoming difficulties towards "complete, final Victory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Television also fuels "psychosis" by emphasizing omnipresent enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   A recent survey by Otkritie bank (October, in cities over 100,000 people) shows Internet media (48% trust) and social networks/Telegram (45% trust) surpassing television (36% trust) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. This contrasts with a Levada Center poll from August, where television was in first place at 51% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This shift is attributed to the urban audience's susceptibility to online media and the impact of the "successful counteroffensive of the Ukrainian armed forces and partial [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]]" which increased fear and anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. However, while information sources are shifting, behavioral changes are not yet observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
*   Despite increased online media consumption, the internet space often reflects the agenda set by television and official news aggregators, which are controlled by the Russian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

A significant finding from the Otkritie Bank survey is that 54% of respondents named "publicly wigs talk shows" as their "least favorite television programs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. This is seen as an "alarming signal for the Russian propaganda system," indicating growing disgust that could evolve into hatred and "complete denial of these sources of propaganda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## Economic Hardship and Social Condition

Research holding Ramir indicates that expenses on food and everyday goods for the average Russian household reached almost 48% of their budget in October, a 6.5% increase from a year ago and a record high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This means nearly half of the average family's income is spent on "existing, namely, existing, namely, surviving" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, leaving significantly less for entertainment, paid medicine, or self-investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:35">[00:20:35]</a>. This situation is described as a "slave state" where people "work only to eat, pay off a mortgage... to have a roof over their heads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. The choice offered to a Russian person is "Live as a slave and die for the Russian president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

On December 8th, 2022, Valery Solovyov analyzed the speech given by the Russian president on December 7th before the Council on Human Rights and Civil Society Development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Solovyov notes that there is a significant and growing distance between the president's words and his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The human rights council is described as a specially selected body from which potential "troublemakers" were removed in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The questions posed to the president were pre-approved by the administration and personally by the president, ensuring no uncomfortable topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Solovyov summarizes Putin's speech with the phrase, "What do you want from a sick mind," suggesting the president's state is not metaphorical but literal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Perceptions of Human Rights and National Interests

The president asserted that the international doctrine of human rights is used to destroy the sovereignty of states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Solovyov counters that these freedoms (free elections, separation of powers, freedom of movement, inviolability of property) threaten only states founded on "the power of criminals, thieves, and bandits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

Regarding Donbass, Putin claimed that the rights of its residents were violated, and they were considered "second-class people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. He stated Russia's only response could be a consistent struggle for its national interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Solovyov questions what Russia is defending, citing issues like 25% of Russian households lacking indoor plumbing and huge territories experiencing depopulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. He notes that the "special military operation" has accelerated this depopulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

Solovyov challenges the narrative on Donbass, suggesting that instead of a military operation, millions of people could have been evacuated for a fraction of the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. He points out that if protecting Donbass residents was so crucial, the president, as Supreme Commander-in-Chief, could have launched an operation in 2014-2015, when the chances of success were disproportionately higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This reveals a "logical inconsistency" where human rights undermine sovereignty in Russia but should undermine Ukraine's sovereignty in Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

### The War's Origin and Responsibility

The president reiterated the narrative that the war was not started by Russia but by Ukrainian authorities after the 2014 coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Solovyov refutes this by citing Igor Strelkov-Girkin, who claimed he started the war in Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

Putin also suggested that a nationalist group in Poland seeks to take western Ukrainian territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Solovyov dismisses this as statements from "marginal groups," akin to Russian State Duma deputies demanding Alaska's return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. He highlights that Poland has been a main sponsor of Ukraine, providing military and humanitarian aid, and accepting the most Ukrainian refugees, without any public or state territorial claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

According to Putin, Russia is the only guarantor of Ukraine's sovereignty and integrity, and the special military operation was launched for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Solovyov sarcastically notes this guarantee involves incorporating Ukrainian territories into Russia, similar to how Russia guaranteed Ukraine's security by signing the Budapest Memorandum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

## Challenges in Military Support and Logistics

While Putin believes "we need to protect the rights of Russians," Solovyov suggests starting with the rights of the [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilized]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Putin expressed surprise at ongoing problems with the equipment of the [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilized]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Solovyov points out that these problems are attributed to "enemies" who have "penetrated the device" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

There are also significant issues with the rehabilitation of wounded military personnel and civilians in the special military operation zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Despite the operation beginning on February 24th, nine months prior, the need to solve issues like rehabilitation, modern prosthetics, drug provision, and travel accessibility is only now being discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This highlights a lack of promptness in the Russian authorities' response to the needs of the [[mobilization_and_military_policies_in_russia | mobilized]] and military personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

## Nuclear Weapons Doctrine

Putin stated that Russia's nuclear weapons are considered only as a means of protection and will only be used if there is "nothing else left" to defend Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Solovyov finds this logically contradictory, noting that Putin also said Russia would not use nuclear weapons first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. Solovyov interprets Putin's phrasing as a recognition of Russia's ability to deliver a first nuclear strike, masked as a "counter-retaliatory" strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. This statement is considered "very dangerous" and ambiguous, potentially implying that if Russia does not use a first strike, it will have "no chance at all to survive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

## The Future of Mobilization

One of the central points of Putin's speech was his claim that "the conversation about additional [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] does not make sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. Solovyov believes this implies it "does not make sense *at the present time*," and that the need for additional [[resumption_of_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] will soon "acquire meaning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. He predicts it will be called "additional recruitment" rather than a [[second_stage_of_mobilization_in_russia | second stage of mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

Solovyov asserts that [[military_preparations_and_mobilization_in_russia | preparations are underway]] for this, with agendas prepared and military commissars awaiting orders from the Supreme Commander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. He suggests that if the concept of "people's war" is adopted, it would require the declaration of martial law and a full [[russian_political_and_military_mobilization | mobilization]] of millions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

Solovyov warns against believing Putin's words, drawing parallels to previous promises about pension reform and constitutional changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. He urges people to observe actions rather than words, noting that current practices, such as preparations for mass [[general_mobilization_readiness_in_russia | mobilization]], directly contradict the president's statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. He also highlights that the president has not signed a decree on the end of partial [[russian_mobilization_and_military_actions | mobilization]], which indicates future plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

Although the president claims there are more than enough [[mobilization_process_in_rusha | mobilized]] people, he also stated that the special military operation "is designed to last a long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. This suggests a continued need for human resources and rotation, as Russian resources "have such an unpleasant property of running out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

## Economic Impact of the Special Military Operation

The "special military operation," ongoing for over nine months, is absorbing a quarter of the Russian Federation's budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. This extensive spending diverts funds from other areas, impacting:
*   New hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>
*   Pension increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>
*   Social payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>
*   Maternity capital increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>

Instead, these funds are allocated to "guns, shells, artillery shots," and equipment production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>. Solovyov mentions the disappearance of one and a half million sets of uniforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a> and the loss of 200 billion out of 300 billion in Russian reserves frozen in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>, implying theft.

The president's touted achievement of turning the Sea of Azov into an inland sea of Russia is juxtaposed with the fact that Russia, the world's largest country by area, is largely "unkempt" <a class="yt=" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Millions of people live without gasification or even basic amenities like proper toilets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. Solovyov argues that Russia should focus on putting its own land in order rather than acquiring more territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

Putin also announced additional payments for primary care doctors starting January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. However, Solovyov notes that 300,000 women, mostly doctors and medical personnel, are expected to be [[second_stage_of_mobilization_in_russia | mobilized]] in the [[second_stage_of_mobilization_in_russia | second stage of mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. This means the remaining doctors will work for "two for three," making the additional payments a "very, very insignificant increase" compared to the workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.

## Presidential Mindset

Solovyov concludes that the president genuinely believes his own narratives, ignoring inconsistencies and illogicalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. This type of thinking is categorized as "medicine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. Solovyov re-emphasizes his summary of Putin's speech: "What do you want from a sick consciousness?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. The tragedy, according to Solovyov, is that this man runs Russia, governing based on his "strange," "bizarre" understanding of the world, which is a "grief and misfortune" for Russians and their neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

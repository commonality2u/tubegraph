The 154th episode of "What is Happening" discussed the United States presidential elections as the most significant international event of the past week, noting their profound impact on global peace and international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Many countries, including Russia, determine their policies based on the election results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Kremlin's Initial Reactions and Proposals

The Kremlin and the [[russian_political_analysis | Russian leadership]] understood the importance of the American elections for both [[russian_political_climate | Russian domestic policy]] and international policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Immediately following the elections, on November 6, two significant Russian elite coalitions, led by Chemezov and Patrushev respectively, sent "enthusiastic congratulations" to Donald Trump through informal channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Proposed Peace Terms for Ukraine
Trump responded to these messages on the same day, referring to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as an "incident" that needed to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The Russian elite's messages also included discussions about a "truce" as a necessary preliminary stage for peace negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

On November 7, a conversation reportedly took place between Trump and "the so-called president of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. During this discussion, the Kremlin outlined its proposed contours for peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>:
*   **Crimea:** Would remain on the Russian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Donetsk and Luhansk:** Would remain on the Russian side within their administrative borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Territorial Exchange:** Ukraine would cede the Kursk region in exchange for Russia giving up fragments of territories controlled in the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Crimean Corridor:** The Kremlin indicated a willingness to abandon the idea of maintaining a land corridor to Crimea, provided that Ukraine guaranteed unimpeded transit of goods and people from mainland Russia to the Crimean peninsula through Ukrainian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Trump's initial reaction was a pause, stating he could not immediately respond and would consider the proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The subsequent leak of this conversation suggests that some in Trump's circle view these proposals as unrealistic or undesirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Trump's Stance and Limitations

Trump aims to act as a peacemaker, envisioning an "epochal achievement" as a "winner" rather than a leader associated with withdrawal or ongoing conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. He has a strong motivation, stemming from his economic-centric policy, to strive for peace and potentially even dream of a Nobel Peace Prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. As president of the most powerful country, Trump has the potential to influence and pressure both sides of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

However, the American president's powers, while significant, are not absolute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Even with his party controlling Congress, Trump is not a dictator and will have to contend with:
*   **One-party officials:** Who may hold stronger views on the international situation, particularly the Russia-Ukraine confrontation, than Trump himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Key positions include the Secretary of State, Assistant to the President for National Security, and Secretary of Defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **The "Deep State":** The Washington bureaucracy, which in Trump's first term, blocked initiatives it considered detrimental to the United States' role and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This influence remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

## The "Putin" Double and Internal Dynamics

The transcript also noted observations about the speech of the "so-called Putin" at the Valdai Forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. During an hour-long speech, the "president" reportedly misspoke, drank, and mispronounced words 44 times, including 29 instances of pronouncing words twice and 12 long pauses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. These "numerous slips of the tongue" and inability to pronounce certain phrases are attributed to a "serious root cause" related to the "double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

It is suggested that the double, Evgeny Vasilyevich, is not highly educated or intelligent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. The fact that the double's "career as president of Russia is ending" has been decided by "Politburo 2," indicating [[potential_political_changes_in_russia_after_putin | a shift in the Russian political situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Despite promises of a quiet, privileged life, the double is reportedly worried about his own fate, understanding the nature of those he deals with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

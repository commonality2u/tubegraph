This article analyzes statements made by the Russian president regarding [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] and its broader implications, drawing on comments from a December 8th, 2022, broadcast. The speaker, Valery Solovyov, provides commentary on the president's address to the Council on Human Rights and Civil Society Development.

## President's Statements on Mobilization

During his address on December 7th, the Russian president stated that "the conversation about additional [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] does not make sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. The speaker, however, warns that this statement refers only to the *present time* and suggests that the need for additional [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] will "acquire meaning" very soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

Instead of a "second stage," it is likely to be called "additional recruitment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. Preparations are reportedly underway, with agendas prepared and military commissars aware and awaiting approval from the supreme commander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that public discussion of this issue makes authorities "slightly nervous," as they understand people are aware and preparing for further [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Discrepancy between Words and Actions
> The speaker highlights a "huge distance" between the president's words and actions, a distance that is "constantly increasing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. He advises against believing words and to instead look at "actions and practices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. The president's failure to sign a decree officially ending [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | partial mobilization]] is cited as a clear indicator of future plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

The president also claimed that Russia does not need [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] because "everything is fine" and they have "more than enough people already mobilized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. However, he then stated that the "special military operation is designed to last a long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, which, according to the speaker, implies a continued need for human resources and rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

## Challenges for Mobilized Personnel

Issues persist regarding the equipment of those mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Despite the conflict beginning over nine months prior, discussions about solving issues like rehabilitation for the wounded, establishing modern prosthetics, providing drugs, and creating an accessible rehabilitation system are "only now" being talked about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This highlights a lack of promptness in the Russian leadership's response to the needs of its military personnel and mobilized citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

One and a half million sets of uniforms have reportedly "disappeared" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

## [[financial_implications_of_mobilization | Financial and Social Impacts]]

The special military operation has absorbed "a quarter of the budget of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. This financial strain means that concerns for Russians' rights, new hospitals, pension increases, social payments, and maternity capital increases "fly out" and are instead spent on "guns, shells, artillery shots," and competition for equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

The speaker also mentions that 300 billion Russian reserves, frozen in Europe, have effectively "disappeared," implying they were "stolen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

Regarding societal impacts, an expected "second stage" of [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] is projected to largely affect women, primarily doctors and medical personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>. This will force those who remain to "work for two, for three," making any additional payments insignificant compared to the increased workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.

## Criticisms of Russia's Internal State and Leadership

The speaker questions what Russia is truly defending, noting that 25% of toilets are still outdoors, territories are "emptying and dying," and pensioners live on "tiny pensions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. He highlights that Donbass has not been thriving since 2014, with 1.5 to 2 million people having left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

The speaker asserts that the president "still believes in all this himself" despite "all the inconsistencies, all the illogicality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. He concludes that this "type of thinking" is "classified as medicine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>, reiterating Fyodor Chistyakov's phrase: "What do you want from a sick mind?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, and lamenting that "this man runs Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

## Nuclear Weapons Doctrine

The president stated that Russia's nuclear weapons are "considered only as a means of protection" and would only be used "if we have nothing else left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. The speaker points out the logical contradiction, noting that if Russia "will not use nuclear weapons" first, it implies that not using them would mean "no chance at all to survive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. He perceives this as a "very dangerous statement" that can be interpreted as a recognition of Russia's ability to deliver a first nuclear strike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

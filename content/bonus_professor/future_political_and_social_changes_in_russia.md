Russia is currently experiencing a period of accelerated change, with events unfolding "extremely quickly" and impacting institutions, circumstances, and individuals across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. This drama and speed of change are expected to intensify, potentially as early as fall, leading to a sharp deterioration of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

## Overall Outlook

The general prognosis for Russia's future indicates a move "from bad to worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. These [[future_challenges_in_russia | future challenges]] are predicted to be primarily political, though they will inevitably affect the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. The changes are anticipated to be spasmodic, suggesting sudden and unexpected downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>.

## Elite Perspectives on Future Leadership

A significant aspect of [[potential_political_changes_in_russia_after_putin | future political changes in Russia]] relates to the leadership. The Russian elite is increasingly grappling with how to navigate the current crisis and preserve face, even if it means acknowledging significant setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>. There is a growing sentiment among the elite that they would prefer President Putin to "suddenly disappear somewhere," thereby taking all responsibility for the "special military operation" and other negative developments of the past two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.

This desire for a change in leadership has led to discussions about two main options:
*   **Assassination Attempt** While a specific attempt on Putin's life occurred, it was likely a "public warning" rather than a fatal strike, possibly hinting at demands from powerful forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:48">[00:22:48]</a>.
*   **Legalistic Departure** Another option involves a gradual, legalistic departure of the President from power, transferring supreme authority into "other hands" and allowing him to retreat into the shadows while potentially still attempting to influence from behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

In anticipation of such a shift, a small, effective "personal council" (an analogue of the Soviet State Council) has reportedly been formed. Its work is expected to begin, with information potentially being published before the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. This suggests a structured approach to [[potential_political_changes_and_future_leadership_in_russia | future leadership]] and governance.

## External Influence on Change

The United States aims to inflict a decisive military defeat on Russia in Ukraine to achieve [[change_in_the_political_landscape_in_russia | political change in the Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. This indicates an external factor actively pushing for a transformation of the Russian political system.

## Internal Weaknesses and Mobilization

The Russian army faces significant shortages in forces, equipment, and, crucially, "moral and volitional qualities," including a lack of faith in victory and understanding of the conflict's meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This deficit is growing and could lead to failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

The idea of using prisoners as "penal battalions" is seen as an indirect admission that Russia either cannot or will not carry out a full mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. Notably, key security officers, Patrushev and Bortnikov, have "harshly" spoken out against mobilization, including partial mobilization, despite earlier preparing such plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Their objection is interpreted as a reaction to the President's "political and physiological weakening," indicating internal resistance to certain state actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Should mobilization proceed, its outcome is predicted to be "very sad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.

These internal dynamics and external pressures contribute to the expectation of significant [[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | sociopolitical changes in Russia]].

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

According to Valery Solovyov, new [[restrictions_and_measures_taken_by_the_government | governmental measures]] are being introduced in Russia, including a new law effective December 1st, requiring additional disclaimers for video content, indicating a trend of increasing regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Potential Restrictions Under Martial Law

The speaker suggests that the second stage of mobilization could be linked to the expansion of [[introduction_of_martial_law_and_restrictions | martial law]] to major Russian cities, or potentially the entire territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. New information indicates plans for significant control over the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>, with the president reportedly informed that technical readiness for this "total control" would be achieved by January-February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### Proposed Control Mechanisms

The proposed system would involve:
*   **QR Codes** These codes would categorize citizens and differentiate their travel permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **Movement Differentiation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>:
    *   **Group 1 (Largest, >70-80% of population)**: Would be prohibited from leaving their respective federal subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.
    *   **Group 2**: Would have slightly expanded travel capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.
    *   **Group 3 (Smallest, most trusted, including security forces)**: Would be allowed to travel throughout the Russian Federation, but still prohibited from leaving the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Exit Visas**: Leaving Russia may require a special permit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.
*   **Curfew and Internment**: Additional [[potential_restrictions_under_martial_law | restrictions]] could include curfews and the possibility of internment, which allows for detention without trial or investigation for up to 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>. A special detention center in Sakharov, near Moscow, is reportedly designated for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Card Blocking**: There is a plan to block bank cards for individuals in the database of mobilized or potentially mobilized people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.

### Comparison to COVID-19 Restrictions
The speaker notes that Russians have already experienced similar limitations during the [[impact_of_covid19_on_russian_society_and_economy | pandemic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

## Feasibility and Outlook
Despite these far-reaching plans, Solovyov expresses serious doubts about their successful implementation, predicting they would lead to "chaos, disorder, and total disorganization" due to Russia's organizational capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. He believes this growing discontent and disorganization could influence the leadership's decision on maintaining or implementing [[introduction_of_martial_law_and_restrictions | martial law]] regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. The speaker warns that nothing good awaits, only bad things, and advises listeners to prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

## Media and Information Control
The speaker notes that authorities use platforms like YouTube as much as the opposition, making a complete shutdown of YouTube a potentially "unproductive step" or "another shot in the leg" for the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>. However, he acknowledges that a full closure of YouTube is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>. He advises people traveling abroad to ensure their phones are free of "questionable materials" that could be flagged by program controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.

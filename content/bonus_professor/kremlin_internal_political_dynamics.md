The program, recorded on Sunday, June 19, focuses on changes within the [[russias_internal_political_dynamics_and_changes | political landscape in Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Kremlin's Strategic Timeline

While the Kremlin is preparing for a long "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, it aims to achieve significant results by the end of autumn or early winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This drive to reach a final stage of armed confrontation is influenced by [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | internal political dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a> and the health of President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | internal political agenda]] will take precedence for the Kremlin, making the ongoing military operation potentially "excessive" and an interference with primary political tasks by the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

## Succession and Elite Conflict

A decision regarding the "transfer of power" or "transit of power" and the "gradual replacement of President Putin" could begin in late autumn/early winter, or even sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Emerging Elite Split
For several months, discussions about tension or a split within the Russian elites were purely hypothetical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. However, these assumptions are now materializing, with a "drain coalition" or "anti-Chekist coalition" beginning to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. More accurately, it can be called an "anti-Patrushev sky coalition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

Key figures forming this coalition include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>:
*   Roman Abramovich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>
*   Anatoly Chubais <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
*   Vladimir Potanin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>
*   Oleg Deripaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> (who demonstratively did not applaud Putin at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>)
*   The Yeltsin family is also associated with Oleg Deripaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

This coalition is "anti-Patrushev sky" because Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council, is attempting to position his son, Dmitry Patrushev (Minister of Agriculture), as Putin's successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. This effort is meeting extreme resistance not only from oligarchs but also from within the security groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. A powerful elite coalition has emerged against power being concentrated in the hands of a security group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. If Dmitry Patrushev becomes successor, his father and other security forces would govern from behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.

### Civilian Counter-Proposal
The aforementioned group, referred to as "group 4," views other individuals as potential successors for Russia's leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. These include Finance Minister Siluanov and Elvira Nabiullina, the head of the Central Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. A potential future configuration sees Siluanov as president and Nabiullina as head of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

This indicates a clear and obvious confrontation between "civilians and security forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. The struggle for "Putin's Russia" has already begun within the last weeks or months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. This intensity is driven by the elite's knowledge that Putin will soon have to leave his position or significantly weaken his presence in Russian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. The "season of struggle" is opening, including a "hunting season" for those who pose a threat or whose departure might send a signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This is exemplified by the sudden death of Alexey Agar.io, former head of UralVagonZavod <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, and other strange deaths of oil workers in recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

The process of elite conflict is just beginning, and citizens can choose to be interested observers or prepare to participate when opportunities arise for influencing Russia's historical trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

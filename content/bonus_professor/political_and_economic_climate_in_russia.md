Valery Solovey presented the 132nd episode of "What's Happening" on Monday, July 15, at one o'clock noon Moscow time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. He addressed his brief silence due to a very busy and intensive trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Security and Assassination Attempts
Valery Solovey provided clarity regarding attempts to assassinate President Putin. He stated that none of the attempts on Putin's life, at least until February 24, 2015, reached the stage of organizational preparation, remaining at the level of conversations and discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Prior to February 2022, President Putin was considered one of the most, if not *the* most, protected persons in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

After February 2022, the idea of assassinating the Russian president "could not help but come to mind," just as the idea of assassinating the Ukrainian president came to the minds of the Russian military-political leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The Russian leadership had expected Zelensky to leave Ukraine or at least move to western Ukraine, initiating an unsuccessful "hunt" for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Later, missiles were fired at Zelensky's locations this year, leading to a "purge" in Ukraine's State Security Service linked to Russian intelligence moles in Zelensky's inner circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. However, these attempts were unsuccessful due to Zelensky's security working in a highly professional manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

Similarly, any attempts on the current Russian leader are unlikely to reach the organizational stage due to first-class security, comparable to that of the late president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

## Internet Control and Censorship
A significant development in [[russian_political_climate | Russian political climate]] is the government's increasing control over internet information. Last week, exercises were conducted to slow down and block YouTube, with the aim of creating problems for its normal functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. These exercises were carried out under the instruction of Nikolai Patrushev, who is responsible for this sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. The military-political leadership considered these exercises "relatively successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

Based on these results, a decision was made to block YouTube nationwide in August-September, not gradually, but in a "one-time" manner, similar to how Facebook and Instagram were banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The authorities also intend to block the WhatsApp messenger along with YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

This move is intended to block opportunities for protest mobilization ahead of anticipated problems in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. The authorities do not believe this will cause a mass negative "effective reaction" (actions) but acknowledge it will be an "additional factor of tension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. From their perspective, the blocking is a worthwhile risk to avoid more serious problems in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

In response to these anticipated blocks, citizens are advised to:
*   Acquire one or more reliable VPNs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The Russian authorities have decided to block any information advertising or providing technical instructions on using VPNs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   Register on Telegram, as the authorities do not intend to block it due to previous unsuccessful experiences and the belief that it's technically impossible to block <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

YouTube is expected to lose 30-40% of its audience, similar to Instagram and Facebook after their bans, due to fear of prohibition and technical unpreparedness among many users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## Impending [[political_crisis_and_economic_implications_in_russia | Political and Economic Crisis]]
A "very intense latent struggle" is occurring behind the scenes, leading to a [[political_crisis_and_economic_implications_in_russia | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. This fall, the situation is expected to become "extremely critical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. This [[political_crisis_and_economic_implications_in_russia | crisis]] is a "funnel" that draws people in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

The [[economic_and_political_challenges_in_russia | economic situation]], despite victorious reports of increased well-being and GDP growth, is "extremely worrying to the authorities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Monetary authorities believe that significant [[economic_and_political_challenges_in_russia | economic problems]] are inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. Discussions about mobilization have also returned to the agenda of the military leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Influential figures within the Russian leadership oppose mobilization, and their reasons will be discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.

## Public Sentiment and Social Issues
According to sociological measurements by the Federal Security Service, dissatisfaction with the authorities is "very great," even "extremely" so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. However, this dissatisfaction does not translate into people's readiness to oppose the authorities; instead, people prefer to demonstrate "emphatically loyalist" or "opportunistic" behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

Regarding the question of whether to stay in Russia or emigrate, Solovey states that the decision depends on an individual's "psychotype," ambitions, resources, and limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. There is no universal answer, as some people are able and willing to leave and start anew, while others prefer to stay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

The government's policy on migrants has changed following the terrorist attack in Crocus, although these changes may be seen as insufficient and not systemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>. Solovey believes that the government will implement a policy that includes the introduction of a visa regime with Central Asian countries to protect the country, its citizens' safety and health, and its way of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

There are "first-class people" (officials, military leadership) who control the "lion's share of national wealth" and are able to withdraw money abroad, with their families living there, while "second-class people" are seen as "cattle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>.

Regarding "victory," Solovey defines it as Russia's "liberation," an "honest and fair life in the country," a focus on national development rather than aggressive foreign policy, and the happiness of its children and grandchildren <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. He believes this will occur when people who desire this determine Russia's fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

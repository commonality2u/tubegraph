The Kremlin, along with President Putin, has initiated a path of "social, technological, and economic degradation" for the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This trajectory is marked by increasing international isolation, internal political shifts, and a move towards a mobilization economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## International Relations and Alliances

The past week saw significant international events, including the G7 meeting and the NATO summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Designation as an Enemy:** Russia has been formally designated as an enemy of the military alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **NATO Expansion and Forces:** A decision was made to deploy 300,000 rapid deployment forces to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. NATO has also promised "unlimited aid and support" to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, and Sweden and Finland are now included in the alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### The New Cold War Dynamic
The current situation is described as a "Cold War" scenario, with the impetus for this confrontation primarily given by the [[kremlins_strategy_and_negotiations | Kremlin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Unlike the previous Cold War, which followed certain rules avoiding direct clashes in the European theater, Ukraine has become a direct conflict zone between Russia and NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This marks a bitter reality, primarily causing suffering for Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Avoiding a Second Front in Europe
There is an apparent effort to prevent the opening of a second front in Europe, especially one directly involving a military alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Kaliningrad Transit:** Brussels is reportedly pressuring Lithuania to resolve the issue of transit through the Kaliningrad region in favor of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This pressure is ongoing and has seen some success, despite public solidarity from Great Britain and the United States with Lithuania's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Brussels is expected to agree to transit conditions favorable to Russia to avoid escalating the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   **G20 Summit:** Vladimir Putin's potential trip to the G20 summit in Indonesia is also described as an "insulting affront" and a "refusal," suggesting he may not be welcome there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Engagement with Central Asia
President Putin recently visited Tajikistan and Turkmenistan, a trip that was nearly cancelled due to his health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
*   **Turkmenistan:** The purpose of the visit to Turkmenistan was related to gas and to emphasize the status of the Caspian Sea as an inland sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. Notably, Putin was not formally met at the gangway, which was at the Russian side's request due to his fear of physical contact and potential assassination attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Tajikistan:** The visit to Tajikistan aimed to improve relations and discuss containing the Taliban, which is designated as extremist in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

## Strategic Military Operations

The "special military operation" in Ukraine has shown limited tactical success but no strategic breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Luhansk Region:** After four and a half months of "fierce armed confrontation," Russian armed forces only gained full control of the Luhansk region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This slow advance has reduced the [[putins_political_challenges_and_potential_leadership_changes | political claims]] of the [[kremlins_strategy_and_negotiations | Kremlin]] and Putin at the public level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Minimizing War Goals:** The publicly stated goal of the operation has been minimized to "liberate Donbass and guarantee the security of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This is a significant shift from the initial goals of "de-Nazification" and "demilitarization of Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, and even a demand for NATO to retreat to its 1997 borders, which has instead led to NATO's expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Internal Political and Economic Mobilization

The [[kremlin_internal_political_dynamics | Kremlin]] is implementing significant internal changes, including economic mobilization and stricter control over public discourse.
*   **Economic Mobilization:** The government has appealed to the State Duma to amend federal law, allowing for "special measures in the sphere of the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This means:
    *   Firms and enterprises, regardless of ownership, will be prohibited from refusing government orders related to military actions outside Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
    *   Businesses will be obliged to supply goods, perform work, and provide services for military operations abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
    *   Authorities can change contract terms and interfere with labor relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
    *   Employees can be forced to work nights, weekends, holidays, and without vacations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This is likened to the situation in the Soviet Union on the eve of June 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Internal Dissent and Repressions:** The [[kremlin_internal_political_dynamics | Kremlin]]'s main concern is not liberal critics but rather "turbo patriots" or "hurray patriots" who criticize the [[kremlins_strategy_and_negotiations | Kremlin]] for perceived concessions or for not being harsh enough in the military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. The FSB has been instructed to "thin out" these critics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. The message is that the right to determine what is fair or needed belongs only to the [[kremlins_foreign_policy_and_blackmail | Kremlin]], and all actions must be enthusiastically approved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
    *   **High-Profile Arrests:** Vladimir Mau, rector of the Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, has been placed under house arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. This is seen as a signal to "systemic liberals" that their loyalty is worth nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
    *   **Cultural Repressions:** The Gogol Center, a cultural institution, is being closed and reverted to the Gogol Theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This reflects the government's move towards simplification and homogenization in a mobilization regime, where cultural complexities are no longer acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a>.
*   **Gazprom Dividends:** Gazprom's refusal to pay dividends for the first time since 1998, on direct orders from the state, signals that private investors are viewed as "freeloaders" and that nothing truly belongs to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:08">[00:20:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>.

## The Strategic Trap

The [[kremlins_strategy_and_negotiations | Kremlin]] is increasingly drawn into a "strategic trap" by continuously escalating its efforts to overcome resistance from Ukraine and the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Depletion of Resources:** This strategy depletes Russia's own material, human, and moral-psychological resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Degradation:** While the world moves forward, Russia is "rolling back along the road of social, technological and economic degradation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This path has been set by the [[kremlins_foreign_policy_and_blackmail | Kremlin]] and President Putin personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Outlook:** The expectation is further restrictions, "harshness," simplification, and pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.

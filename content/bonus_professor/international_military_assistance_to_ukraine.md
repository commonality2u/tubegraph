International efforts and discussions around military assistance to Ukraine highlight a shifting approach to the conflict. Initially, there were expectations that European leaders would pressure Ukraine into peace talks and territorial concessions, but this stance evolved significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Diplomatic Engagements and Shifting Stances

During a visit to Kyiv by the leaders of France, Germany, and Italy (referred to as the "big three"), expectations were that they would persuade Ukrainian President Zelensky to engage in peace talks with Russia and make territorial compromises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Behind the scenes, such a decision was indeed discussed, with Draghi and Macron reportedly acting as the main persuaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

However, the public statement following these negotiations declared "unconditional support for the position of Ukraine, including territorial integrity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It was also made clear that peace negotiations would not be conducted without Ukraine achieving military success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This shift in position was attributed to several factors:
*   President Zelensky's firm stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   The strong position of the United States, Great Britain, and a significant portion of [[ukraine_conflict_and_nato_relations | NATO]] countries who favor a solution or preparation for peace negotiations on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   The "psycho-emotional impact" on the visiting leaders after seeing Irpin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

Following the "big three" visit, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also traveled to Kyiv, reaffirming his unconditional solidarity with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Focus on Military Assistance

The primary concern for Ukraine and its allies is the provision of "real military assistance, its size and quality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This assistance aims to provide Ukraine with at least equality with the Russian Federation, if not decisive superiority, to achieve a strategic turn on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

The United States is seen as the only country capable of providing such decisive assistance, and it appears ready to do so, despite the risk of increasing conflict with the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This aid, specifically weapons, is expected to arrive in July, along with personnel trained in the US and [[ukraine_conflict_and_nato_relations | NATO]] countries to operate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Qualitative changes on the battlefield are anticipated by late July or early August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Ukraine's Negotiation Strategy

David Arakhamia, the head of Ukraine's negotiating group with Russia (currently frozen), stated that Ukraine could resume negotiations with Russia at the end of August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This timeline is based on calculations that Ukraine's negotiating position would be strengthened by then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

This strengthened position would result from:
*   The arrival of a sufficient number of new weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   A "serious change on the battlefield" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   This could include the return of Kherson under Ukrainian control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
    *   A counteroffensive in Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

The potential resumption of peace talks does not imply an end to the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Both Boris Johnson and [[ukraine_conflict_and_nato_relations | NATO]] Secretary General Stoltenberg have called for [[ukraines_military_strategy_and_international_support | NATO]] countries to prepare for a "long campaign" and "long-term assistance to Ukraine calculated for several years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This assistance includes military aid, support for maintaining Ukraine's state infrastructure, and aid for its restoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

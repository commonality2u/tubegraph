The concept of technological sovereignty, defined as a nation's ability to create its own base for the production of high-tech products, has been identified as a key strategic direction for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This strategy marks a shift from a market economy to a policy of isolationism, aiming for self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

## The Ideal of Technological Sovereignty

The notion of achieving technological sovereignty is presented as an ideal for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Historically, nations like North Korea and Iran are cited as examples of countries that have achieved a degree of technological sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. North Korea, in particular, is described as having a level of technological development comparable to the USSR in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

However, the speaker suggests that this ideal is likely "unattainable" for Russia due to "extremely serious limitations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

## Appointment and Responsibilities

Denis Manturov has been appointed vice-premier, with responsibility for [[strategies_for_overcoming_economic_challenges | import substitution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, and is now also tasked with achieving technological sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

## Economic Realities and Challenges

The push for technological sovereignty comes amidst significant [[socioeconomic_challenges_in_russia | economic challenges]] and struggles with [[strategies_for_overcoming_economic_challenges | import substitution]] policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Data from May 2022 illustrates a sharp decline in various industrial sectors:
*   Car production collapsed by 97% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   Passenger buses by 77% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   Diesel locomotives by 63% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.
*   Washing machines by 59% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   Refrigerators by 58% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   Freight cars by 52% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   Passenger cars by 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

It is predicted that the outcome of the technological sovereignty initiative will mirror the results of import substitution, with immense financial expenditure leading to minimal tangible benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

### Broader Economic Implications

Beyond domestic industrial decline, [[economic_challenges_in_russia_and_governmental_strategies | Russia's foreign policy]] has involved exerting pressure on Europe through "gas blackmail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This strategy, aiming to compel Europe to pressure Ukraine into negotiations on Russian terms, leverages [[economic_implications_of_oil_prices_and_export_strategies | economic problems]] aggravated by rising energy prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. These pressures are observed to potentially lead to internal political crises in European countries, as seen in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

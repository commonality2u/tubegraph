Russian citizens face a range of potential impacts and restrictions due to ongoing political and military developments, including a likely renewed [[hidden_mobilization_and_economic_impact_in_russia | partial mobilization]]. These impacts span financial, social, and legal aspects of daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Financial Restrictions

A significant concern among Russians is the possible blocking of bank accounts and cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Although amendments to the law on the creation of a single register of military personnel do not explicitly mention this restriction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, it is considered the "easiest and most effective way" to compel individuals to report to military registration and enlistment offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

It is believed that the banking system is prepared for such measures, with Nabiullina having received presidential instructions to prepare for account and card blocking since September of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This measure would likely target those who receive electronic summonses or appeals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Advice for Citizens

To adapt to potential financial restrictions, citizens are advised to accumulate personal cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The authorities are not concerned with how individuals manage their finances or work in such scenarios, expecting people to "spin" as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Other Restrictions

The amendments to the law on the single register of military personnel include other types of restrictions for those who do not report to military enlistment offices:
*   A ban on traveling to the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   A ban on real estate transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   A ban on registering (and possibly operating as) an individual entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   A ban on driving a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

The effectiveness of these restrictions is debated, as a significant portion of the population does not possess foreign passports (~20%) or cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. If an individual has no foreign passport, car, or individual entrepreneur status, they might feel protected from mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Martial Law Implications
Should martial law be introduced, there could be a ban on the movement of Russians between regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. While not imminent, this ban is provided for under martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

## Mobilization Dynamics

A second wave of [[hidden_mobilization_and_economic_impact_in_russia | partial mobilization]] is anticipated to resume with renewed vigor in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **No Criminal Punishment:** There is currently no criminal liability for evading mobilization in the Criminal Code, and it is unlikely to appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Not a single person was administratively or criminally punished for evasion during the previous partial mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Voluntary vs. Coerced:** The authorities expect a sufficient number of people to volunteer or be coerced into joining, for instance, due to blocked cards affecting their families <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **"Traps":** While there won't be a "hunt for everyone," traps will be set in busy areas like train stations, large city metro stations, and possibly supermarkets in smaller cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Police patrols alongside military enlistment office personnel will be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Reservists' Travel:** Reservists should be wary of traveling by plane and train, as these are places with busy traffic where those who could be called up are monitored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Those who receive a summons are at particular risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Required Specializations:** Drivers (car, armored vehicle) and grenade launchers are among the types of reservists needed first and foremost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### Conscripts and Contracts
It is possible for conscripts to be sent to military service under contract almost immediately upon joining, rather than after the previous requirement of three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Pressure will be exerted on many to sign contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Individuals are advised not to sign anything and to contact lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Students
Students are at risk of mobilization, particularly graduates who have completed bachelor's or master's degrees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. While deferments formally extend until September 1, they are sometimes ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Students are advised to secure a master's degree program or an enterprise that can provide a reservation to avoid conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Societal Mood and Propaganda

[[public_opinion_and_its_impact_on_russian_political_dynamics | Public opinion]] shows accumulating potential for discontent, described as "latent discontent" that is growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. However, additional circumstances are needed for this to translate into public action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

Propaganda influences people through its massiveness and by depriving them of alternatives, creating a "spiral of silence" effect where people believe everyone thinks the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The current period is considered the "hardest thing" in post-Soviet history, but there is hope for a favorable outcome for Russia and its society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. The crisis is expected to be moderate in duration, perhaps a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.

### Reforms
If the situation in Russia changes for the better, security forces will undergo significant reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:21">[00:35:21]</a>. Some personnel will be retired or subjected to lustration, while others may remain in service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:32">[00:35:32]</a>. These structures will be decisively reformed, though it will take several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>. The court system is also prioritized for reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. Plans for these reforms already exist, and the main factor is political will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

### Justice
Russian society is currently based on "total injustice" and the "total trampling of human and civil rights" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:19">[00:32:19]</a>. The goal is to make the country and society incomparably more just <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

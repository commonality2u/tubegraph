Valery Solovey, speaking from Moscow, describes a rapidly deteriorating situation, stating that the situation will develop "more alarmingly faster fleeting and worse" than previously expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. He foresees a very high probability of [[Russian general mobilization and martial law | martial law on a general national scale]] throughout Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Approaching Martial Law and its Implications
Should [[Russia moving toward martial law | martial law]] be introduced, existing legal contradictions and even the law itself will lose their meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Authorities would gain the power to do "whatever they want" with citizens' lives, meager property, and modest savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

The process of introducing "military serfdom" in Russia began on April 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. With the introduction of martial law, this "enslavement of the Russian population will be successfully completed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

The coming year will require everyone to live in a state of "severe constant permanent stress," where life, property, and savings face not just constant, but also a growing threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Strategic Priorities for Survival
In this escalating crisis, two main priorities are identified:
1.  **Preserving life and health:** This includes the individual's life and health, as well as that of family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
2.  **Preserving property, savings, and business:** This refers to the usually modest assets and any business an individual may have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Losses are Inevitable
> It is explicitly stated that "none of us will be able to get out of what we are facing without losses individually and no family" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. People should be prepared to lose money and endure wasted nerves, accepting that "losses are inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. The advice is to weigh what is more dear: "it is better to lose a little money than a precious life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

All other concerns, such as apartment repairs, purchases, or vacation plans, are secondary to solving these two primary problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. It is advised not to try to solve everything at once, and to forget or ignore some secondary tasks due to lack of time and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Practical Recommendations

### Managing Stress and Seeking Support
Living through this crisis requires learning to manage stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Individuals will find it "impossible or extremely difficult" to survive alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. The stress will be strong, almost constant, intensify, and last for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Support from others is crucial to share fears and concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

*   **Social and Family Support:** Friends and family provide a safe haven and can offer help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:44">[01:00:44]</a>. Women are noted to play a primary role in building emotional balance and mental stability within families, as men may more easily fall into prostration or panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Stress Relief Techniques:**
    *   Alcohol: Only very moderately, as overuse can intensify depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
    *   Sedatives: Useful for acute reactions to reduce severity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   Sex, sports, walks in fresh air, pets, and children are also listed as traditional ways to relieve stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Mindset:** The instinctive reactions of "fight or run" are not advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Instead, it's necessary to think rationally and consistently about what can be done for personal benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Calmness and absence of hysteria and panic are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

### Navigating [[Military operations and mobilization in Russia | Military Operations and Mobilization Measures]]
*   **Avoiding Risks:** Individuals should avoid places and situations where risks of "getting in for the good" increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, as police and other agencies will receive instructions to "comb the public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Mobilization Status:** The "partial mobilization" that began in September of the previous year has not been officially completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. So far, no person has been subjected to criminal or administrative prosecution for evading mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Even with martial law, the risks of such prosecution are expected to be minimal, with only demonstrative punishments occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Summonses and Databases:** The "single register of military personnel" for summonses is not yet ready and will only appear in the fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. However, some existing databases are already integrated and sufficient for sending summonses and "combing the public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. The law adopted on April 11, which suggests 20 days to respond to a summons, is considered a lie; there will be no 20-day period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>.
*   **Immediate Consequences of Summons/Detainment:**
    *   Accounts and bank cards will be blocked automatically, even though the law doesn't mention it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. This is considered the most effective measure in documents presented to the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
    *   Driver's licenses will be confiscated, and civil and property rights restricted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
    *   Individuals stopped on the road may have their license canceled and be directly taken to a military registration and enlistment office, then straight to an assembly point, and "into the fields" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.
    *   Mobilized personnel will be expected to transition towards "self-sufficiency" for equipment like bulletproof vests, with families expected to supply them, similar to past partial mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

### Protecting Property and Funds
*   **Cash and Transfers:** It is advised to withdraw money or transfer it to trusted relatives or friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. Always keep a sufficient amount of cash for "necessary operational freedom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
*   **Cars:** A general power of attorney will not protect a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. The car, as personal property, will be impounded, and the owner will still be forced to pay for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. Compensation for impounded cars is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.
*   **Businesses:** Protecting a business is more difficult, and in some cases, it may not be possible to transfer ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. It is highly recommended to consult lawyers for schemes to protect property and business, and to act quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. A lawyer's phone number should always be kept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

## Conclusion
The current period is described as a "holiday of common misfortune" or a "funeral feast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>. The goal is to survive this "mournful funeral feast with the least losses," perhaps losing some money and "skin," but remaining "alive and well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

The essential advice is:
1.  **Calmness:** Or at least the absence of hysteria and panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.
2.  **Safe Haven:** Reliable friends or an extensive family that can provide assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
3.  **A Spare Person:** This is the "desired minimum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

The time of great changes has arrived, fraught with great troubles and a high price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.

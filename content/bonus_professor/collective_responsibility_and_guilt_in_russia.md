The concept of collective responsibility of Russians for current events, and a resulting feeling of guilt, has been raised by various politicians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This sense of guilt is reported to be emerging in public consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Rejection of Collective Guilt
Valery Solovey explicitly states that he does not endorse the concepts of collective guilt or collective responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. His reasoning is that if everyone is deemed guilty, then effectively no one is guilty, as the responsibility is "smeared in a thin layer over everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Instead, Solovey aligns with a viewpoint formulated by Bolshevik leaders in the mid-1930s, specifically citing Lazar Kaganovich, who stated that "every mistake has a last name, first name and patronymic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Solovey extends this principle, asserting that "Each crime Especially and each criminal Especially has a last name, first name, patronymic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Consequently, he believes that individuals "must and will be held personally accountable to the full extent of the law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, with the degree of accountability depending on the scope of mistakes and crimes committed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

This article is based on the 21st episode of Valery Solovyov's program "What is Happening," recorded on Sunday, July 17th, and released on Monday, July 18th. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> The episode's central theme revolves around the Kremlin's strategic choices between "the unacceptable and the impossible," with blackmail as a key instrument of [[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_operations | foreign policy]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>

### The Disappointing State Duma Meeting

The primary event of the preceding week was the anticipated meeting of the State Duma on July 15. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a> Expectations surrounding this meeting were significant, with several "cardinal" options prepared, including the announcement of martial law in border regions with Ukraine. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a> However, the actual outcome was described as "the mountain gave birth not even to mice with cancer," as the results failed to meet these alarming expectations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> The key outcomes were merely the appointment of Denis Manturov as vice-premier responsible for import substitution and the adoption of several laws. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>

### Kremlin's Hesitations and Strategic Dilemmas

The Russian President's hesitation to adopt more "cardinal" options is a significant point. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a> While the phrase "Fate helps the brave" might have been the motto on February 23rd, leading to the special military operation on February 24th, it has become apparent that "fate does not always help the daring." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> The hesitations experienced by the Russian Federation's president reflect the less-than-successful course of the special military operation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> The elusive nature of the operation's plan, which was never made public, allows for various interpretations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

### Internal Divisions within the Elite

The president's indecision is not only due to the slow pace of the special military operation but also the prevailing moods within the ruling elites. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a> Two main viewpoints have crystallized regarding the conflict's outcome:
*   **Majority View (including military):** Advocates for accepting the current status quo, meaning the achieved territorial acquisitions, and then entering negotiations with Ukraine for an agreement or at least a truce. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>
*   **Radical Minority View:** Insists on fighting to a "victorious end," which implies taking control of cities like Kharkiv and Dnipro, the entire Black Sea coast (including Mykolaiv and Odesa regions), and extending control to Moldova. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>

The president is reportedly hesitating because the radical minority is relatively influential, while the moderate majority, though persistent and reflecting the military establishment's opinion, is less influential. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> The first option (stopping now) is deemed unacceptable by Ukraine and its Western allies, while the second option (fighting to the bitter end) is considered militarily unfeasible, given the past five months of conflict. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>

### [[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_operations | Kremlin's External Strategy]]: Blackmail

The Kremlin is actively seeking a way out of this dilemma, which manifests not only in public statements but also in direct pressure on Europe. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a> The strategy is to pressure Europe, so Europe, in turn, pressures Ukraine to agree to reconciliation on Russian terms. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>

This pressure involves:
*   **Gas Blackmail:** Russia is using gas supplies to aggravate economic problems in Europe, leading to rising energy prices and potential domestic political crises, as seen in Italy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   **Forceful Blackmail:** On July 15, parallel to the Duma meeting, an operational meeting of the Security Council took place. While an open summary was minimal, a closed part of the meeting generated leaks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a> These leaks, deliberately directed at "unfriendly" Western countries, purportedly discussed "extremely unpleasant and dangerous" measures of influence on Europe. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a> The goal is to hint at unused possibilities of forceful blackmail, hoping Europe will then pressure Kyiv to concede. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a> These leaks, even if accurate, aim to scare, as "reality always scares, not fantasy." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>
*   **Warning against Ukrainian Counteroffensive:** The leaks also serve to warn Ukraine against a counteroffensive, which Ukrainian officials periodically discuss and which is reportedly scheduled for August. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> Analytical assessments received by the Russian leadership suggest a real (though not inevitable) threat of losing the Kherson region in such an event. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>

### [[russias_economic_challenges_and_strategy | "Technological Sovereignty"]]: A Move Towards Isolationism

While blackmailing the West, the Kremlin is also preparing for a long confrontation, fostering the idea of a "besieged fortress." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a> This is exemplified by Manturov's phrase during his State Duma speech: "We need to move from a market economy strategy to a strategy of technological sovereignty." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>

"Technological sovereignty" is described as "the poetics of isolationism" and an attempt to become self-sufficient in high-tech product production. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a> However, its attainability is questioned, noting that only countries like North Korea (technologically at the level of the USSR in the 1960s) and Iran have achieved it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a> Manturov, now responsible for this, was previously in charge of import substitution, which saw significant declines in production by May 2022 (e.g., car production down 97%, washing machines down 59%). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a> This suggests that "technological sovereignty" might suffer a similar fate, with immense funds spent without tangible results. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>

### Public Opinion and Repression

Closed surveys indicate a third of Russians (slightly less than 30%) believe the special military operation should be stopped immediately. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> This sentiment prevails among young people, particularly those aged 18-24, where 56% favor stopping and only 19% favor continuing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a> Among 25-34 year olds, 43% support continuation versus 41% for stopping. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a> The majority in favor of continuing the operation (72%) are respondents over 60, who are not threatened by mobilization. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>

There's a notable divide based on information sources:
*   **Internet Users:** 47% favor stopping the operation, while 35% favor continuing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>
*   **TV Viewers:** The opposite trend is observed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>

To counter declining public support and the influence of the internet, the Russian state is intensifying repressive policies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a> Recent amendments to the criminal code signed by the President include:
*   Public calls against Russia's security: Up to 7 years in prison and a fine. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>
*   Repeated propaganda/demonstration of Nazi or extremist symbols (e.g., Facebook, Instagram logos): Up to 4 years in prison or a fine. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>
*   Confidential cooperation with foreign countries: 2 to 8 years in prison with a fine up to one million rubles. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>

These "repressive amendments" are adopted due to a lack of confidence in nationwide support for the special military operation, aiming to enforce apparent support through legislative barriers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>

### Looking Ahead: August Turbulence

August is anticipated to bring increased political turbulence for two main reasons:
1.  **New Phase in Armed Confrontation:** The conflict between Russia and Ukraine is likely to enter a new phase. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>
2.  **Supreme Power Transit Decisions:** Important internal political decisions related to the transit of supreme power may be made, including the potential appearance of a new prime minister. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>

The possibility of a mass mobilization (full or partial) is not ruled out, especially if Ukraine launches a successful counteroffensive, as it may be seen as the only alternative. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>

The speaker warns of sharply increasing risks for political commentary due to the new repressive laws, indicating a potential need to moderate or suspend activities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a> Despite the gloomy outlook, the message concludes with a call for vigilance, mutual support, and belief in a future victory. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>

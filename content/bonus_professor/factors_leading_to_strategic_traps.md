The concept of a "strategic trap" describes a situation where a party, often a superpower, finds itself in a conflict with no clear path to achieving its military-political objectives through military means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Despite this fundamental inability, the party continues to escalate efforts to achieve these goals, which are often obviously unattainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This term is applicable beyond military art, extending to business and other strategic fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

The current [[strategic_situation_of_the_russian_federation|strategic situation of the Russian Federation]] is considered a strategic trap, largely created by President Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Historical Examples of Strategic Traps

Historically, superpowers have fallen into such traps, which tend to be prolonged:
*   The United States in Vietnam (1965-1973) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>.
*   The United States in Afghanistan (2001-2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   The Soviet Union in Afghanistan (1979-1989) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   Modern [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_strategic_traps|Russia in Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

These situations consistently resulted in withdrawal and political defeat, though not always military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Superpowers in these traps waste colossal resources to no avail, eventually making belated political decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

## Factors Leading to Strategic Traps

Several factors contribute to countries, and even corporations, falling into strategic traps:

### Overestimation of Own Power
One side of the conflict overestimates its own economic and [[military_operations_and_strategic_goals|military]] capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

### Underestimation of Enemy Strength
The other side underestimates the enemy's strength, including not only military power but also the capacity of civilians to maintain resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

### Misunderstanding the Theater of Military Operations
The party holding the initiative often fails to grasp the unique significance and specifics of the military theater, such as the jungles in Vietnam or the mountainous terrain in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

### Error in Assessing the Strategic Context
This is a critical factor, especially for modern [[strategic_situation_of_the_russian_federation|Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Historically, this could mean misjudging the confrontation between superpowers providing assistance to opposing sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. For example:
*   North Vietnam received aid from the Soviet Union and China, despite strained relations between the latter two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.
*   Afghanistan, during the Soviet conflict, received aid from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.
*   Ukraine now receives significant assistance from the West, including equipment, intelligence, technology, and mercenaries from Western PMCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. Russian propaganda accurately notes the West's opposition to [[strategic_situation_of_the_russian_federation|Russia]] in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

## Reasons for Persistence in Strategic Traps

Even when facing predictions of danger, countries tend to remain stuck in these situations. There are three primary explanations for this persistence:

### Arrogance of Power
This is the hope that the difference in economic and military potential will eventually favor the side with greater power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. This "arrogance of power" was noted by James Folbreak and is characteristic of superpowers, including the United States in Vietnam and Afghanistan, the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, and the [[strategic_situation_of_the_russian_federation|Russian Federation]] in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

### Cognitive Delusion
This psychological phenomenon is common not only among ordinary people but also within military-political leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. It manifests as a desire to "recoup" losses by continuously increasing stakes, similar to a casino player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. Examples include US Defense Secretary McNamara's repeated proposals to increase military presence in Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>, Soviet behavior in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>, and [[strategic_situation_of_the_russian_federation|Russia]]'s energy war in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. This delusion prevents leaders from fixing losses, leading to continuous investment in losing projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. The "third-person effect" also contributes, where a country believes it will succeed where others (e.g., the Soviet Union in Afghanistan) failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>.

### Distorting Properties of Religion or Ideology
While not typical for the US or Soviet Union (though ideology played a role) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>, this factor can prolong conflicts. The Iran-Iraq War, which lasted eight years and resulted in over 1.5 million casualties, is cited as an example, influenced by Iran's "passionate, heated ideology of the victorious Islamic revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>.

## Superpowers vs. Smaller Nations

While cognitive delusions affect all people and political systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>, only countries with colossal economic and [[military_operations_and_strategic_goals|military]] potential, like superpowers (or Iran in its context), can afford to persist in such delusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. Economically developed but smaller nations are typically forced to abandon conflicts and seek reconciliation more quickly due to resource constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

Democratic systems tend to react faster to resource depletion because leaders face [[election_risks_and_strategies|election risks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a>. This contributes to the observation that conflicts over the past 200 years average 3-4 to 16-18 months in duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. In contrast, authoritarian leaders are more likely to persist, even in high-intensity regional conflicts like the [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_strategic_traps|Russia-Ukraine confrontation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>. This is because losing or withdrawing on terms they perceive as dishonorable is fraught with the loss of political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.

## [[strategic_situation_of_the_russian_federation|Russia]]'s Situation

[[strategic_situation_of_the_russian_federation|Russia]] is currently in a strategic trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. However, unlike previous superpowers like the Soviet Union, [[strategic_situation_of_the_russian_federation|Russia]] is not considered a superpower, especially given its GDP share of 1.7% compared to the US (23%) and the EU (17%), plus Japan and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. This colossal incomparability of economic and [[military_operations_and_strategic_goals|military]] potentials suggests that victory is not possible, only an honorable withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>. The Russian government "blew this chance" for an honorable exit in March 2022, when Ukraine was ready to make concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>.

As the situation worsens, President Putin is willing to resort to extreme measures for an honorable exit that can be presented as a victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>. He has two resources: nuclear tactical weapons and manpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>. Believing [[strategic_situation_of_the_russian_federation|Russia]]'s human potential significantly exceeds Ukraine's, he is prepared to "throw the people into the furnace of confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. Losses of up to half a million people are reportedly considered acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>.

The internal goals of the "special operation" have shifted from external objectives to the preservation of Putin's own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>. However, this strategy paradoxically weakens his power daily, as those around him and in society recognize the country is caught in a trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:58:00">[20:58:00]</a>.

There is no conspiracy theory behind strategic traps; political and [[military_operations_and_strategic_goals|military]] leadership willingly enters these situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>. Once deeply entrenched and unwilling to withdraw, opponents begin to wage a "war of attrition," as seen with US aid to Afghan Dushmans and increasing Western aid to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>. This presents an opportunity to deliver a decisive blow to the military power of the [[strategic_situation_of_the_russian_federation|Russian Federation]] and deter future military force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>. This opportunity was provided by President Vladimir Putin himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.

This article addresses various restrictions and measures implemented or potentially implemented by the Russian government, particularly in the context of ongoing mobilization and martial law.

## Mobilization and Financial Restrictions

The upcoming second round or continuation of the so-called partial mobilization has raised many questions, especially regarding the possible blocking of bank accounts and bank cards of Russian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. While amendments to the law on the creation of a single register of military personnel do not explicitly mention the blocking of bank accounts, they do include other restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

Current restrictions under the law on military personnel registration include:
*   A ban on traveling to the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
*   A ban on real estate transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   A ban on registering as an individual entrepreneur, potentially extending to general activities as an individual entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   A ban on driving a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

Despite these measures, there has been no administrative or criminal punishment for evading mobilization during the initial partial mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. It is unlikely that criminal liability for evasion will appear in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

### Bank Account Blocking

The most effective way to compel people to report to military registration and enlistment offices is by blocking their bank accounts and cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. Once individuals comply, their accounts would be unblocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. The banking system is reportedly prepared for such measures, with the Central Bank governor, Nabiullina, preparing for account and card blocking since September of the previous year based on presidential instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. This measure would affect those who receive electronic summonses or appeals, creating a multiplier effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. Citizens are advised to save personal money in cash if possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

### Mobilization Tactics and Draft Evasion
Instead of broadly "hunting" for everyone, authorities will likely set "traps" in places with busy pedestrian flows, such as train stations, large metro stations, and potentially supermarkets in smaller cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

There is an expectation that conscripts might be forced to sign contracts for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. Individuals are advised not to sign anything and to contact lawyers to resist such pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

Students, particularly graduates (bachelor's and master's), are in the risk group for mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>. While their deferment formally extends until September 1, this deferment has been ignored in some cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>. Students should seek master's programs or enterprises that offer reservations to avoid conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. Reservists are warned to be cautious when traveling by plane or train, as these are places with high traffic where authorities will monitor those who could be called up, especially those who receive a summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. Drivers, including car and armored vehicle drivers, and grenade launchers, are particularly sought after among reservists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>.

## Potential Restrictions Under Martial Law

[[potential_restrictions_under_martial_law|Martial law]] could include a ban on the movement of Russians between regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. While it is not certain that [[introduction_of_martial_law_and_restrictions|martial law]] will be introduced, such a ban is provisioned for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:57:00">[12:57:00]</a>. If [[introduction_of_martial_law_and_restrictions|martial law]] is declared, border [[closure_of_borders_and_restrictions_on_movement|closures and restrictions on movement]] would likely apply to those in the database of individuals potentially subject to mobilization, which currently numbers around 15 million people and is rapidly expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

## Broader Governmental Control

A proposed bill by State Duma deputy Wasserman suggests that all cash holdings over a million rubles should be declared to tax authorities with an explanation of their origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>. Although the Ministry of Finance expressed a negative opinion, this bill reflects the authorities' intention to implement tighter digital control over finances and limit freedoms, moving towards what is described as an "electronic Gulag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>.

[[information_iron_curtain_and_media_restrictions_in_Russia|Media censorship and freedom of information in Russia]] continues as the government attempts to prepare for YouTube's potential blocking by buying popular bloggers for VK and RuTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>. However, it is stated that YouTube will not be closed because it would be technically impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>.

[[cultural_and_political_repression_in_Russia|Repression]] is expected to intensify, with a rapid tightening of "screws" (restrictions) measured in months, not years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:56:00">[25:56:00]</a>.

## Propaganda's Influence
Propaganda's effectiveness stems from its massiveness and its ability to deprive individuals of alternative information, creating a "spiral of silence" where people believe everyone thinks the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:00">[22:32:00]</a>. It is argued that Ukrainian propaganda is currently more effective than Russian propaganda, especially for an external audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57:00">[22:57:00]</a>.

## Post-Change Government and Reforms
In the event of positive change in the country's situation, reforms are expected for security forces. Some personnel would retire, some would be subject to lustration, and others would remain but within drastically reformed structures. The court system and other departments would also undergo reform, though this process would take several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:32:00">[35:32:00]</a>. Plans for these reforms already exist, and the main factor for their implementation would be political will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:00">[36:13:00]</a>.

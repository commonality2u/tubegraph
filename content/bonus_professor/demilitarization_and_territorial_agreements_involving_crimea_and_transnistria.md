An urgent broadcast on November 11 reports that a significant strategic turning point in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has been consolidated in Ukraine's favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This assessment was confirmed by sensational news that began arriving on the evening of November 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Peace Deal Proposal

The Kremlin received an offer for a [[proposed_peace_deal_and_russian_capitulation | peace deal]] with Ukraine on November 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This proposal, which has been agreed upon with the Ukrainian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, is essentially a proposal for the capitulation of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The information regarding this proposal was received from multiple trustworthy sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Conditions of the Proposal

The core conditions of the proposed deal are:
*   **Withdrawal from Ukraine** The Russian armed forces must completely leave Ukraine, including the territories of the DPR and LPR, which Russia claims as its subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Crimea Status** The status of Crimea is to be suspended for seven years, meaning it will not be discussed during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The peninsula itself is to be declared a demilitarized zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Only police and border guards, equipped with small arms, would be permitted there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The Black Sea Fleet is required to leave Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   *Note:* Real estate sales in Crimea have sharply decreased, indicating a decline in demand for purchases in recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Demilitarized Border Strip** A demilitarized strip, 100 kilometers wide, would be established along the borders of Russia with Ukraine and Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This strip must not contain heavy weapons from either side, though it is understood this rule would primarily apply to exclude Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Guarantor Countries** Six countries have consented to act as guarantors of this agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Transnistria** Russia must withdraw its military base from Transnistria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. In 2023, Transnistria is to be integrated into Moldova, and Russia is to undertake not to interfere with this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Ukraine's NATO Pledge** In return, Ukraine promises not to join NATO for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Russian Reaction to the Proposal

The initial reaction from the Russian establishment to this [[proposed_peace_deal_and_russian_capitulation | ultimatum]] (or offer of capitulation) has been positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This is attributed to the fact that the proposal includes guarantees of freedom and security for the establishment, including security forces, ensuring that no criminal cases will be brought against them or their families, and they will not be persecuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. It is also assumed that at least part of their assets would be preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

President Putin's reaction is currently unclear; he is still deliberating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Refusal Indication** If massive missile attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure, particularly power plants, resume, this would signify an unambiguous refusal of these conditions by the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Continued Reflection** If there is no shelling, it does not necessarily mean acceptance, but rather that reflection continues, and an attempt is being made to gain additional time to comprehend the situation and hope for a miracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

If the president rejects these conditions, which the Russian establishment is ready to accept, military action will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. A military defeat of the Russian Federation is highly probable in this scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Putin's only means to delay such a defeat would be to use a nuclear threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. However, under these favorable conditions, the chances increase that an order to use tactical nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction would be blocked or not carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. The non-execution of such orders would de facto mean the end of Vladimir Putin's presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

Regardless of his decision, President Putin will eventually have to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. If he accepts the [[proposed_peace_deal_and_russian_capitulation | ultimatum]], he will have to move into the shadows to save face and shift responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This situation also carries the risk of a palace coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. If he continues the military campaign, hoping for a miracle, he will inevitably become a scapegoat for its defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

These proposed conditions genuinely exist and have been agreed upon with Ukraine, transferred by a reliable party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Such a sharp turn in Russian politics, both internationally and domestically, would signify a complete and final fiasco of 22 years of Putin's rule and policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. A historical analogy is the defeat of Russia in the Crimean War (1853-1856) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

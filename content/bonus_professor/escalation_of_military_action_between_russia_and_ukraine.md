The [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia-Ukraine conflict]] is described as entering a new, more dangerous phase of escalation, moving beyond a mere continuation of military action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:08">[02:40:08]</a>. This analysis, recorded on Wednesday, November 16, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>, suggests significant developments following a rejected peace proposal.

## Rejection of Peace Proposal and Initial Escalation

The Kremlin reportedly received a peace proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:09">[00:58:09]</a>. The reaction to this proposal was anticipated to be either the launch or the non-launch of massive missile strikes on Ukrainian infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:08">[01:05:08]</a>. On Tuesday, November 15, a massive strike of unprecedented scale was launched, indicating that the Kremlin, specifically President Putin, rejected the peace proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>.

A tragic incident occurred in Poland involving missile strikes and the deaths of two Poles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:08">[01:30:08]</a>. While the investigation is ongoing, it is considered unlikely that this incident will become a *casus belli* or lead to NATO activating Article 5, which implies a collective response to an attack on a NATO member <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:08">[01:53:08]</a>. Apparently, no one in NATO is interested in Article 5 being triggered at this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:08">[02:12:08]</a>.

## Implications of Escalation for Ukraine

The escalation of military action means that Ukraine will likely receive new weapons, including long-range ammunition and missiles, and potentially drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:08">[03:32:08]</a>. This extended range means that not only border regions but also areas deeper within Russia, specifically Central Russia, could come within the destruction zone of Ukrainian armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:08">[03:54:08]</a>.

As a related development, Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council, was reportedly sent to inspect the air defense system in Central Russia to assess its readiness to repel "new challenges and threats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:08">[04:09:08]</a>.

Recent events on the Ukrainian side include the undermining of the steel key oil depot in the Varlovskaya region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:08">[04:34:08]</a>. There are also reports, as of 12:23 PM Moscow time on November 16, that Ukrainian troops have gone on the offensive in the Popasnaya area, and potentially up to the Kharkov region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:08">[04:56:08]</a>.

## Implications of Escalation for Russia

### Military Actions and Strategy
Russia is expected to continue massive shelling if it has sufficient missiles, potentially accumulating them or receiving them from a strategic ally in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:08">[05:29:08]</a>. However, a full-scale offensive or counteroffensive by [[russian_military_tactics_in_ukraine | Russian armed forces]] within Ukraine is considered unlikely, as Russia has adopted a concept of strategic defense utilizing mobilized contingents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:08">[05:57:08]</a>.

### Mobilization
Despite official announcements that mobilization has ended, the relevant regulatory document has not yet been submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:08">[06:17:08]</a>. Military enlistment offices are still receiving calls for mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:08">[06:24:08]</a>. A second stage of mobilization is reportedly scheduled for after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:08">[06:40:08]</a>. If Ukrainian offensives are successful, this second stage may be expedited, with mobilized personnel currently undergoing training being sent to the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:08">[06:46:08]</a>.

### Potential Expansion of Conflict Zone
Escalation could involve the participation of NATO countries that are actively supporting Ukraine's defense and offense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:08">[07:25:08]</a>. While the United States is excluded from this assessment, symmetrical strikes on these countries are not ruled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:08">[07:39:08]</a>. Russia is capable of effective cyber operations and could target logistics hubs through sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:08">[07:55:08]</a>. The conflict zone could be expanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:08">[08:08:08]</a>.

### Domestic Restrictions and Economic Mobilization
Martial law, currently applied in the "new territories of Ukraine" that Russia formally considers its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:08">[08:34:08]</a>, may be extended to Russian regions bordering Ukraine, and then to major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:08">[08:48:08]</a>.

This escalation will be accompanied by further restrictions on civil liberties, including freedom of movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:08">[09:49:08]</a>. New hybrid authorities, potentially military-civilian administrations or military commandants, could gain powers to detain citizens without trial for 30 days and confiscate property from individuals and businesses (e.g., vehicles, equipment for uniforms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:08">[10:04:08]</a>. A curfew may also be introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:08">[10:19:08]</a>.

The economy will undergo further non-stateization and mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:08">[11:04:08]</a>. It is estimated that up to 40% of the Russian economy is already connected to the "special military operation," a share expected to increase due to insufficient Russian resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:08">[11:11:08]</a>.

### Political and Social Dynamics
Putin's popularity is reportedly falling rapidly, although the readiness for protest is not growing as quickly, but it is increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:08">[11:40:08]</a>. The authorities' response to this trend is to "tighten the screws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:08">[11:59:08]</a>.

## Broader Predictions and Historical Analogies
The speaker predicts that the [[military_and_strategic_implications_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | military crisis]] into which Russia is drawn will inevitably develop into a large-scale and acute political crisis, potentially leading to a colossal crisis and the collapse of Russian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:08">[12:58:08]</a>. This does not imply the disappearance or perishing of Russia, but rather a significant transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:08">[13:21:08]</a>.

Putin is believed to hold the personal conviction that escalation – raising the stakes – is the only way to force the West to retreat and pressure Ukraine into a peace agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:08">[14:00:08]</a>. However, this is predicted not to happen, as the West does not intend to retreat and will increase pressure on Russia through Ukraine and other means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:08">[14:14:08]</a>. Russia, based on its combined power, is considered unable to withstand the pressure of the consolidated West, unlike historical instances where it could leverage divisions within the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:08">[14:31:08]</a>.

The "darkest times" for Russian history in the 21st century are predicted, comparable in scale to historical events like the Crimean War (1853-1856), the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and the First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:08">[15:26:08]</a>. The period from 1990-1992, which saw the collapse of the Soviet Union, is also cited as a comparable era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:40:08">[19:40:08]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes the importance of mutual support, maintaining health, normal family relationships, and common sense during these challenging times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:08">[19:45:08]</a>. Despite the looming difficulties, a message of eventual victory is conveyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:08">[20:24:08]</a>.

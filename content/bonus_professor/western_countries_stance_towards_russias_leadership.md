According to Valery Solovey, Western countries and China are prepared to engage with a double of the Russian president, rather than the actual Vladimir Putin, reflecting their primary interests in maintaining the status quo and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

## Western Readiness for a Double
The West is ready to deal with a double and even a new dictator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. They are fully aware that Putin is being replaced by a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. China is also aware of this and is prepared to receive the double on a visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>. This indicates a pragmatism aimed at preserving existing power structures rather than promoting democratic change within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

## Western Interests
The primary concern for Western nations is to maintain political stability in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. If a dictatorship ensures this stability and there is no risk of losing control over Russia's nuclear arsenal, then "any figure will suit them perfectly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. This approach prioritizes their own interests over the freedom or economic well-being of the Russian people, leading to a policy described as "absolutely hypocritical and two-faced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

The [[Western perception of the current Russian ruling group | current Western perception]] and engagement strategy show a willingness to tolerate the existing [[Current political climate and leadership in Russia | Russian political climate and leadership]], even if it involves a double, for the sake of geopolitical stability. This also influences the [[Role and perception of Russian leadership and power structures | role and perception of Russian leadership and power structures]] in international relations.

### Comparison with China's Stance
[[Chinas stance on Russia and Ukraine conflict | China's stance]], similarly, is driven by its own economic interests, specifically maintaining Russia's economic dependence on China to secure raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

## Future Outlook
Despite the current stance of Western countries, the speaker believes that after Putin's departure and the ensuing crisis, there will be an opportunity for Russia to transition to a path of "free, competitive, and competitive development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

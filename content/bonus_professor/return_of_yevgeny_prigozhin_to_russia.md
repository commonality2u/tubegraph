The return of [[yevgeny_prigozhins_peace_calls | Yevgeny Prigozhin]] was announced as one of the main topics of a program on June 3 at 1 PM Moscow time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. However, all political meanings and movements related to [[yevgeny_prigozhins_peace_calls | Prigozhin]] are considered secondary or even tertiary compared to the "main line of what is happening," which is the construction of a new configuration of power in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## A "Return" in Stone

The "return" of [[yevgeny_prigozhins_peace_calls | Yevgeny Prigozhin]] to Russia is currently manifest in the appearance of a full-length bronze monument to him in St. Petersburg, located at the Porokhovskoy cemetery, which is referred to as his "so-called grave" because he is not actually buried there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. The speaker imagines a future scenario where [[yevgeny_prigozhins_peace_calls | Prigozhin]] "definitely" returns to Russia, visits his own grave, and admires the monument erected for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

## Broader Context and Implications

This situation is described as grotesque, infernal, or even macabre humor, embodying the unpredictable nature of events in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>.

> The Latin phrase "appreciated admirari" (meaning "don't be surprised at anything") is suggested as a suitable motto for anyone trying to understand Russian politics, as "the most unexpected and the most unforeseen will happen" there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>.

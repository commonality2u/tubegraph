From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Valery Solovey's 55th episode of "What's happening" discusses how [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Vladimir Putin]] generates "meaningless information noise" and distinguishes it from actual "events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Information Noise vs. Events
Information reasons are what make themselves discussed, often produced in large quantities with insignificant or zero underlying grounds, filling the information field with "information noise" or even "information garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. An event, conversely, is something that truly affects the situation at present or in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The past week was characterized by a wealth of information reasons, with the President of Russia, [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Vladimir Putin]], being the main producer of this "information garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Putin's Role in Generating Information Noise
Recent examples of this "information garbage" include [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin's]] speech in Ulan-Ude, his speech to the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, and alleged trips to Crimea and Mariupol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### The Use of Doubles
Of these "information occasions," only [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin's]] speech to businessmen, industrialists, and entrepreneurs at the House of Music involved the President of the Russian Federation personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. In all other "information events," such as the Ulan-Ude helicopter plant visit, the Crimea trip, and the night trip to Mariupol, a [[speculations_around_putin_and_doubles | double of Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin]] was the key figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Abroad, the presence of [[speculations_around_putin_and_doubles | Putin's doubles]] used for important "noise production" in Russian domestic policy is already a byword and no longer doubted in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. The argument is that the real [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Vladimir Vladimirovich]] would never go to a place where he could be threatened by "even a hypothetical danger" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. The double can even "look even better than the Russian president" in terms of content, though their sense of humor is "practically identical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The only personal appearance by [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] was before businessmen, as "many people know him there and it would be very indecent" if he hadn't spoken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. During this speech, he was "on speed," or very strong stimulants, which "revived his mental activity" in a noticeable, though not necessarily beneficial, way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. These appearances did not and could not affect the real situation in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Deteriorating Relations with Business Elite
After [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin's]] speech, industrialists and entrepreneurs were "extremely disappointed" as they did not receive answers to their concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. A number of "marshals" and "admirals" of [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Russian business]] did not even attend the meeting to avoid falling under sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

> "For some of the richest people in Russia, [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Vladimir Vladimirovich]] looks like a leper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Whereas before February 24th, 2022, they sought closeness to him for material dividends, now they avoid him because [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] is considered a "toxic asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Significant Events

### Xi Jinping's Visit
The main event expected is Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow, which is anticipated to "really affect Russian domestic and possibly foreign policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The Kremlin is "frozen in anticipation" regarding the visit's outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

[[health_and_public_appearances_of_president_putin | Putin's]] physical shape is not very good; efforts were made over the weekend to bring him to a "decent state" for Xi Jinping's visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. The speaker notes that [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Vladimir Vladimirovich's]] double is "capable of gesticulating, but not the current Russian president himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

China's goal in relation to Russia is to weaken the Russian Federation, tying it to China, ensuring Russia is "weak and ends up tied to China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. China does not desire a strong Russia, but also not an "absolute, complete defeat of Russia on the Ukrainian fronts" as this would be a "bad sign for China itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. China's peace initiative is unlikely to succeed, as the Americans and Ukrainian leadership have stated it is unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### International Criminal Court Warrant
Another significant event is the issuance of a warrant by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for [[health_and_public_appearances_of_vladimir_putin | Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin]] on suspicion of committing war crimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

#### Impact of the Warrant
1.  **Legal and Symbolic Aspect**: This is an important precedent, moving the "persecution of senior officials of the Russian Federation" into the legal plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. It creates apprehension among [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Russian officials]] about who might follow [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. The U.S., while skeptical of the ICC, is prepared to actively participate in organizing a trial for crimes in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
2.  **Domestic Political Aspect**: Before February 24th, [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] was a "guarantor of wealth and privileges," but after, he became a "toxic asset" that the [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Russian elite]] wants to discard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. While the elite may show outward solidarity, there are groups within it "capable of extremely decisive actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The increasing desire and capabilities of these people could lead to "practical action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
3.  **International Political Aspect**: [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] is now considered a "leper" on the international stage, a "toxic asset" whom it is "better not to deal with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. This "Black Mark" sent to the Russian president signifies a "cardinal" change in atmosphere around the Russian president and the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
4.  **Influence on Putin's Mental State**: The warrant "drove [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin]] into a deep depression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. His "mental state" is "frankly upset," with a "professional medical qualification" of his condition being discussed in some Telegram channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. This increases the risk of "unforeseen actions" or "dangerous decisions," a fact understood by his closest circle, who are now seriously contemplating a "much closer" and "extremely unpleasant" future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

## Parallel Mobilization
A "hidden," "parallel," "quiet," and "veiled" mobilization has begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. This process involves invitations for document verification in over 45 regions of the Russian Federation, and summonses for military training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

*   The military commissariat of Buryatia stated that mobilization "did not stop" because there was a decree on its beginning but no decree on its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
*   Reports (unconfirmed) from Penza allege that university graduates will receive a notice for military call-up along with their diplomas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.

This mobilization uses "blackmail, threats of violence, and promises" to force people to the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>. Promises include high salaries (e.g., 200,000 rubles a month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. Those who resist are labeled unpatriotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>. There is a high risk that this combination of measures will "force a considerable number of people to join the active army," as "a lot of people are needed on the eve of the Ukrainian counteroffensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>. The goal is to increase troop numbers by "400 thousand people" within one and a half to two months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>. The Kremlin is confident there will be no protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

## Economic Impact: "10 Years Down the Drain"
Due to the "special military operation" and [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin's]] policies, "10 years of labor" have been "zeroed out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:10">[00:21:10]</a>. Real incomes of Russians are 6.5% lower than in 2013, and the actual volume of goods consumption is 9.1% less than in 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. This is described as a "brilliant result of [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin's]] foreign policy and [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin's]] economic growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. This phrase, "10 years down the drain," is expected to summarize [[vladimir_putin_and_his_political_strategies | Putin's]] rule, extending to "at least 22-23" years, representing "almost a quarter of a century torn out of life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>.

A recent program discussed the alleged visit of a "Putin" double, identified as Yevgeny Vasilyevich, to Belarus for a meeting with Belarusian President [[lukashenko_and_early_presidential_elections_in_belarus | Alexander Grigorievich Lukashenko]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. The speaker asserts it is a "pure fact that Putin died on October 26" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, suggesting that the individual visiting Belarus was indeed a double.

## Meeting Dynamics and Lukashenko's Conduct

During the meeting, Lukashenko greeted the "so-called Putin" by saying, "I am glad to welcome you to your native Belarusian land" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The speaker interprets this as Lukashenko [[lukashenko_and_early_presidential_elections_in_belarus | trolling]] the double, given that the double is supposedly from Mogilev, a city in Belarus, making Belarus "truly native" to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This behavior is seen as characteristic of Lukashenko, whom the speaker describes as a "fat troll" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Observations from the meeting indicated that Lukashenko "dominated" and "mocked his Vis-a-vis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, a stark contrast to how he would have interacted with the original Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Furthermore, it was noted that the double is "taller than the original by at least 5-7 cm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

## Discussion on Illegitimacy of Zelensky

A primary outcome of the meeting was a statement regarding the "illegitimate Zelensky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The speaker highlighted the hypocrisy of this statement, noting that Lukashenko himself "lost the elections of the year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>, and the Russian elections were an "exceptional profanation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. The speaker further characterizes the "double" as a "puppet in the hands of [[putins_leadership_and_political_influence | Nikolai Platonovich Patrushev]] and members of the Politburo 2.0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

It was argued that Ukraine, engaged in a "war for survival," is not obliged to hold elections during military actions, citing historical experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. The Russian side's attempt to "compromise disavow Zelensky" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a> and undermine the idea of the Switzerland peace conference was evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

### Yanukovych's Involvement

To further bolster the claims of Zelensky's illegitimacy, Viktor Yanukovych was allegedly "forced to fly to Minsk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a> despite being seriously ill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The intention was to present him as a "legitimate candidate" to lead "liberated lands of Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. However, the speaker dismisses this argument as "absolute fiction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

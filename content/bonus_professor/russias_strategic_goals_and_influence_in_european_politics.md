Russia's strategic approach during the ongoing conflict involves a shift from seeking a military turning point to consolidating its territorial gains and pushing for a diplomatic resolution on its own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Diplomatic and Political Maneuvers

Russia is consistently attempting to transition the conflict to peace negotiations, albeit on its own terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. This involves:
*   **Consolidating the Status Quo** Russia increasingly aims to solidify the new territorial status quo it has achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This means seeking negotiations with Ukraine to legalize current territorial gains, including:
    *   Recognition of Crimea as Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   Recognition of Donbas as independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   Recognition of territories in the Kherson region and parts of the Zaporizhzhya region as Russian, securing a land bridge to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
    *   Despite official declarations like "Kherson is now forever with Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>, there are internal voices indicating a readiness to lose these new territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Russia is also constructing defensive fortifications in newly acquired territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Influence in European Politics

Russia has actively sought to influence European politicians to achieve its strategic goals, particularly in pushing for peace negotiations on its terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Revival of [[influence_and_interests_of_foreign_countries_in_russian_politics|Russian Agents of Influence]]
There has been an observed revival of [[influence_and_interests_of_foreign_countries_in_russian_politics|Russian agents of influence]] in European Union countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This includes leveraging:
*   **Personal Ties** Former Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi, a "great personal friend of Putin" and a figure sympathetic to Russia, publicly stated that Europe must convince Ukraine to accept Russia's conditions in negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Political Leverage** Russia holds leverage and influence over certain European politicians, including current leaders like French President Macron and German Chancellor Schulz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Diplomatic Proposals** The Italian Foreign Ministry sent proposals to end the conflict that, while not as overtly pro-Russian as Berlusconi's, could still be quite profitable for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. French and German politicians are also seen explicitly or implicitly offering to make peace "here and now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

### Reasons for European Leaders' Stance
Several factors are cited for European leaders' cautious push for peace:
*   **[[influence_and_interests_of_foreign_countries_in_russian_politics|Russian Influence]]** Russia possesses leverage and [[influence_and_interests_of_foreign_countries_in_russian_politics|influence on some European politicians]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Fear of Escalation** European leaders, particularly in France, Italy, and Germany, fear an escalation of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This concern includes the potential use of non-conventional weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a> and an increase in the number of refugees, which already imposes significant financial and social burdens on EU countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Global Food Security** The conflict limits Ukraine's ability to export grain, raising the threat of global famine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. [[russian_political_and_military_strategies|Russian propaganda]] and officials actively exploit this threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

### Countering Russian Influence
The United States has actively intervened to counter attempts by European leaders to diverge from a unified stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The US "unflatteringly" made it clear to Chancellor Schulz and Macron that it possesses compromising information ("dirt") on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The US insists that these leaders adhere to "Euro-Atlantic solidarity" and the NATO-developed course of "unconditional support of Ukraine," implying continued warfare until a Ukrainian victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

Ukraine, supported by the Anglo-Saxon bloc (Great Britain and the United States), Poland, the Baltic countries, and others, maintains that the conflict's outcome will be determined on the battlefield, not through immediate peace negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

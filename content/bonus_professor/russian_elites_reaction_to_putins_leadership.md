The [[Russian political climate and leadership | Russian elite]], including industrialists and entrepreneurs, have shown a shifting attitude towards Vladimir Putin, especially in the period following February 24, 2022. This shift is characterized by a move from seeking proximity to the President to actively distancing themselves, compounded by the issuance of an International Criminal Court warrant against him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Putin's Public Appearances and Doubles

Vladimir Putin has increasingly produced "meaningless information noise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, with the President of Russia being the primary source of this "information garbage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Alleged trips to Ulan-Ude, Crimea, and Mariupol, as well as a speech to the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, were widely publicized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

However, it is asserted that a double of Vladimir Putin participated in most of these events, including visits to the helicopter plant in Ulan-Ude, Crimea, and Mariupol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The only event where the President himself was reportedly present was a speech to businessmen, industrialists, and entrepreneurs at the House of Music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This was necessary because many attendees knew him personally, and his absence would have been considered "indecent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Disappointment and Distancing by Business Leaders

Industrialists and entrepreneurs expressed extreme disappointment after Putin's speech, feeling that their "concerns" and the "challenges that modernity poses to them" were not addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

Furthermore, a significant number of "very wealthy people," referred to as "marshals" or "admirals of Russian business," intentionally skipped the meeting to avoid falling under sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Putin as a "Toxic Asset"

Prior to February 24, 2022, closeness to Putin was sought for "material dividends" and "preferences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. However, for many of Russia's wealthiest individuals, Putin has become a "leper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a> and a "toxic asset" that they wish to "throw off their hands as soon as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. They now actively avoid the Russian president and try to distance themselves from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Impact of the International Criminal Court Warrant

The issuance of a warrant by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for Vladimir Putin on suspicion of committing war crimes is considered a major event with significant implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. While Russia, China, India, and the United States do not recognize the ICC's jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, the warrant has already profoundly influenced the situation in Russia and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

### Domestic Political Repercussions

The warrant has several key influences domestically:
*   **Legal Precedent**: The persecution of high-ranking Russian officials has now shifted from the political and propaganda sphere to the legal plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Official Cringing**: High-ranking Russian officials are now "cringing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, despite public declarations of solidarity with Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Elite Discontent**: The [[Russian political dynamics and leadership issues | Russian elite]] cannot immediately react to the warrant but will do so "passively, toothlessly, with internal grumbling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. However, within this elite, there are "groups of people capable of extremely decisive actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. There is a growing sentiment that their "desire and capabilities" for such actions could increase significantly, potentially moving into a "practical plane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. The visit of [[Xi Jinping]] to Moscow could serve as a "trigger for certain actions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

### Putin's Mental State

The ICC warrant has driven Putin into a "deep depression," affecting his already suboptimal "mental state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This has led to concerns among his closest circle about an increased risk of "unforeseen actions" or "dangerous decisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. These individuals are reportedly "seriously beginning to think about the fact that the future is no longer that before and most importantly this future is extremely unpleasant in its consequences much closer than before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

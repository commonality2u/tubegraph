On Thursday, October 26th, at approximately 9 PM, Russian President [[death_of_vladimir_putin_and_new_reality_in_Russia | Vladimir Putin died]] at his Valdai residence, according to Leri Solovey, who made this announcement on October 27th [00:01:04]. Solovey noted that the event was anticipated, as he had publicly stated several times that [[vladimir_putins_health_and_political_future | Vladimir Putin would not survive that fall and would likely die even earlier]] [00:01:31]. He also stated privately that Putin would die no later than October, with public video evidence supporting his predictions [00:01:44].

More [[death_of_vladimir_putin_and_new_reality_in_Russia | details of his death]], described as "not a pleasant death" and involving "not pleasant posthumous adventures," are available in posts on "grana Gene SV" [00:01:15].

## Attempts to Conceal the Death

There will be attempts to [[psychological_and_informational_impact_of_Putins_death | hide Putin's death]], which is considered possible in authoritarian regimes [00:02:24]. Examples of hidden deaths include Heydar Aliyev, Hugo Chavez, and Islam Karimov, whose deaths were concealed for three months, and Zhirinovsky's, hidden for a month [00:02:39].

The process of hiding [[psychological_and_informational_impact_of_Putins_death | Putin's death]] is made easier because for the past two to three months, he has been "very successfully replaced by a double," or a "deuce" in the professional jargon of the Federal Security Service and Presidential Security Service [00:04:04]. This double can be used for a short time to cover the transition to a post-Putin reality, or [[speculation_on_putins_health_and_the_future_of_Putinism | Putin's future without Putin himself]] [00:04:21]. However, the use of the double is limited to a maximum of two to three months [00:04:41].

## Information Suppression and Government Mistakes

Following the announcement, a "wave of curses, insults, lies, and ridicule" has begun [00:02:58]. There have also been attempts to hack accounts, including Solovey's, on the night of Thursday, October 26th, into Friday [00:03:11].

However, the more refutations and lies on a topic, the faster the information spreads, drawing in new groups for discussion [00:03:23]. This creates an "information shell" that grows like a snowball [00:03:41]. The government, if smarter, would try to ignore and contain such information, but instead, it makes mistakes an experienced PR person would avoid [00:03:46].

## Immediate Implications

The [[potential_consequences_of_putins_death | possible development of the situation]] suggests an attempt to maintain the status quo, meaning there will be no new liberties or freedoms [00:02:07]. There will also be no reduction in military tension on the fronts [00:05:28]. Instead, there might be another tightening of control, as the government fears public reaction [00:05:37]. A decision was made in October, when Putin was no longer able to negotiate with Ukraine from a strong position, to avoid de-escalation [00:05:49].

## Optimism and Future Outlook

Despite the grim outlook, there is optimism that "everything is not bad at all" [00:06:32]. The speaker emphasizes that "we survived it" and are alive [00:06:40].

Drawing on Mikhail Gorbachev's phrase, "the process has started" [00:07:09]. [[death_of_vladimir_putin_and_new_reality_in_Russia | Putin's death has torn the core out of the regime]] he created, causing it to collapse like an avalanche, and it will not be possible to save it [00:07:15].

This event is seen as the beginning of a significant "window" or "opening" for change [00:07:50]. The future will depend heavily on the actions of individuals [00:08:18]. There is a call to "choose the right side of history" and to stand with those fighting for freedom and justice for Russia [00:08:25].

While direct action might be limited, individuals can help by:
*   Reposting information to ensure its dissemination [00:08:52].
*   Liking content [00:09:02].
*   Providing financial assistance, which is considered "extremely important" as "money is the blood of politics" [00:09:05].

The speaker assures that events are developing in the predicted direction, emphasizing that "victory will be ours" [00:09:15].

On Wednesday, November 16, it was reported that the [[Kremlins Strategy and Negotiations | Kremlin]], specifically President Putin, had rejected a [[Peace proposals and negotiations between Russia and Ukraine | Peace Proposal]] previously received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This rejection was signaled by the launch of an unprecedentedly large-scale massive missile strike on Ukrainian infrastructure on Tuesday, November 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The speaker had previously stated that the [[Kremlins perception of peace with Ukraine | Kremlin's reaction]] to the [[Proposal for peace deal between Russia and Ukraine | Peace Proposal]] would determine whether such strikes were launched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Immediate Aftermath and Escalation

The rejection of the [[Proposal for peace deal between Russia and Ukraine | peace proposals]] is interpreted as a categorical refusal and signals an escalation of military action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This escalation is seen as a transition to a "new, more dangerous phase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, with President Putin resorting to a "spearhead counter-escalation" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Consequences for Ukraine

Following the [[Kremlins rejection of Peace Proposal | Kremlin's rejection]], Ukraine is expected to receive new and more advanced weaponry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>:
*   Long-range ammunition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>
*   Longer-range missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>
*   Drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>

This means that Ukrainian armed forces will have the capability to strike not only border regions of Russia but also Central Russia, with the potential for the strike radius to continuously expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. As evidence of this threat, Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev was sent to inspect the air defense system in Central Russia on November 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Incidents like the undermining of the steel key oil depot in the Varlovskaya region are also anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. New Ukrainian offensives, such as the alleged one near Popasnaya, are also expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Consequences for Russia

The [[Kremlins rejection of Peace Proposal | Kremlin's rejection]] and subsequent escalation will also have significant ramifications within Russia:
*   **Continued Massive Shelling:** Russia will continue massive shelling if it has enough missiles or can acquire them from allies, although a strategic ally in the Middle East has not yet promised to share missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   **Shift to Strategic Defense:** An offensive or counteroffensive by Russian armed forces in Ukraine is deemed unlikely; Russia has shifted to a concept of strategic defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Second Stage of Mobilization:** While President Putin announced the end of mobilization, the relevant regulatory document has not been submitted, allowing military registration and enlistment offices to continue calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. A second stage of mobilization is expected after the New Year, or possibly sooner if Ukrainian offensives are successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Involvement of NATO Countries:** The escalation could involve NATO countries actively assisting Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Symmetrical strikes, such as cyberattacks or sabotage on logistics hubs, are not excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Martial Law and Restrictions:** Martial law, already present in "new territories" of Ukraine, may be extended to Russian regions bordering Ukraine, and eventually to major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This would lead to further restrictions on civil liberties, including freedom of movement, curfews, and the potential for detention without trial for up to 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Military-civilian administrations or commandants would have the power to confiscate property from citizens and enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Mobilization of Economy:** The economy will undergo further "non-stateization" and mobilization, with the share of the economy connected to the special military operation expected to increase from 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Future Outlook

The speaker suggests that the [[Kremlins rejection of Peace Proposal | Kremlin's rejection]] is part of Putin's "personal strategy" and "conviction that escalation, that is, raising the stakes, is the only way to force the West to retreat and put pressure on Ukraine so that Ukraine would sign a peace agreement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. However, this strategy is predicted to fail, as the West does not intend to retreat and will increase pressure on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Russia is deemed unable to withstand the pressure of the consolidated West, unlike historical instances where it fought parts of the West while relying on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

The military crisis resulting from the rejection is expected to develop into a large-scale political crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, and potentially lead to the collapse of Russian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Putin's declining popularity, as indicated by closed polls, is a factor driving the authorities to further tighten screws on society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. The speaker predicts that Putin will eventually face the dilemma of admitting loss or using tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that Russia is entering "the darkest times of our history in the 21st century," comparable in scale to events from a hundred years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. Historical analogies include the Crimean War (1853-1856), the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and the First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. This military crisis will be accompanied by an economic and financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

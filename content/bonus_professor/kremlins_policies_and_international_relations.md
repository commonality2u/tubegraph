The internal political landscape of Russia, particularly concerning the Kremlin's policies and its international relations, has been a subject of significant discussion. The dynamics observed over the last month and a half or two months relate primarily to the return of Alexei Navalny and subsequent protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Kremlin's Reaction to Internal Dynamics

The Kremlin leadership is highly attuned to public discourse, with the SVR telegram channel being read by the entire Russian leadership and an overwhelming majority of high-ranking officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

[[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Vladimir Putin]] is described as aware of the risks he faces and attempts to use all possible means to cling to power, believing he will succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. However, the SVR believes that there will be an opportunity to imprison him within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. They assert they have clear goals and a plan to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### Putin's Decision-Making and Fears
[[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]] is characterized as a "rat driven into a corner" â€“ old, sick, and resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. While not a "complete idiot," he is sensible and understands the rules by which he plays within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. The SVR's strategy is to operate by their own rules and manipulate him by pressing "levers" to induce certain actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. He is a very suspicious person with many phobias, fearful of being manipulated, a fear that is skillfully exploited by those around him, including the SVR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

The health factor significantly influences [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin's]] decision-making, affecting many processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. Public disclosure of his health information, facilitated by the SVR, has had a serious impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Even the management of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, FSB, and Armed Forces considers his health, realizing that guarantees from a "sick dying person" are effectively zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

[[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]] is described as "maniacally afraid" of his plans becoming known, as this often leads to their cancellation or postponement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>. This fear is a key target for the SVR, whose objective is to interfere with his plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. As a result, early presidential elections and even the president's message to the Federal Assembly have been postponed indefinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. This suggests that [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]] is forced to "dance to our tune" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

Recently, [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]] has become very withdrawn and trusts almost no one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. It is difficult to live under such moral and psychological pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

### Key Influencers in the Kremlin
[[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]] relies most on two individuals: Nikolai Platonovich Patrushev and Yuri Kovalchuk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. Others, like Sechin, hold less influence; [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]] uses Sechin when it's convenient but distances himself when not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>. Kiriyenko is considered more influential than Sechin, taking responsibility for carrying out tasks, particularly those related to elections and plebiscites, which [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]] appreciates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.

## International Relations and Kremlin's Foreign Policy

### Hybrid Warfare and Cyberattacks
[[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]] respects and fears any US president, and during his reign, classic espionage in the United States was minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. However, [[Russian military operations and international relations | hybrid warfare]] methods, especially cyberattacks, have become his main profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. Cyberattacks have been significant against the US, France, and Germany, with constant cyberattacks occurring against Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. The effectiveness of these methods lies in the ability to avoid direct blame, allowing Russia to deny involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>. These methods cause serious suffering for governments and ordinary people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.

### Relationships with Other World Leaders
[[International relations and diplomatic stances of Kremlin | Putin]] respects the positions of the US President and the Chinese leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Chinese leaders hold significant economic and political leverage over [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]], and he fulfills their whims and desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:22">[00:26:22]</a>.

Angela Merkel is also respected by [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]], and he is forced to reckon with her, despite personally disliking her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.

Erdogan is considered [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin's]] "alter ego" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]] reportedly helped Erdogan avoid a coup by relaying intelligence about military preparations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.

### [[Kremlins diplomatic strategies with Ukraine and the West | Kremlin's Policy Towards Ukraine]]
The Kremlin refused a large-scale war against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:30">[00:45:30]</a>. There were prepared plans, including proposals to introduce troops into Ukrainian territories like Kharkov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:52">[00:45:52]</a>. However, the decision was made not to accept Yanukovych as a refugee and not to introduce troops, which led to Yanukovych fleeing Kharkov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>.

### [[Russias international relations and sanctions | Sanctions and Oligarchs]]
The SVR plans to release materials regarding oligarchs considered guilty of supporting the Kremlin, including Usmanov and Deripaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:55">[00:47:55]</a>. Usmanov is specifically implicated in drug trafficking in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:06">[00:48:06]</a>.

### Relationship with Lukashenko
Lukashenko is seen as manipulating [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]], with [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]] almost "on his knees" asking Lukashenko to release certain individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:32">[00:55:32]</a>. A loan of three billion dollars will undoubtedly be allocated to Lukashenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>. [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]] supports Lukashenko regardless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:20]</a>. The relationship between [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]] and Lukashenko is deeply intertwined both emotionally and otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:27">[00:56:27]</a>. While [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]] has acted against protests, the situation in Belarus is much more brutal and terrible, making a direct comparison difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:48">[00:56:48]</a>.

## Future Disclosures
The SVR intends to continue releasing incriminating materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. They plan to release the "most sensational" materials, which will constitute a "crescendo" when they feel close to achieving their goal of changing the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>. This includes potential revelations about the Polish plane crash where the Polish president died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:12">[00:57:12]</a>. All evidence will be put through the court system to ensure those who committed crimes face justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:52">[00:42:52]</a>.

The SVR emphasizes that it is possible to reform Russian special services, citing Georgia's successful reforms under Mikheil Saakashvili as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:56">[00:58:56]</a>. They believe the main purge should start with a complete lustration of the entire judicial corps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>. Russian special services are considered professionally competent, and if the criminal component (murders, special operations, hybrid warfare) is removed and they focus on real external and internal threats rather than fighting opposition or crime, they can be brought to a qualitatively new level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>. Failures like the Skripal poisoning or Navalny's poisoning are attributed to the degradation of specific groups, not the entire special services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>.

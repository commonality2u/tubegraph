Valery Solovya, Doctor of Historical Sciences, political analyst, and public figure, provided an overview of the military-political week on May 15 [00:00:07]. He noted that the situation was deteriorating, drawing a parallel to Voinovich's quote, "things were going badly on the collective farm... but every year for some reason it is getting worse and worse" [00:00:30].

## Kremlin's Strategic Challenges and Dilemmas

The Kremlin has been unable to achieve a turning point in the [[ukraine_russia_conflict | special military operation]] in its favor, a fact evident to all uncommitted observers [00:00:59]. The likelihood of achieving a strategic turning point without the use of "extremely potent means" (weapons of mass destruction) is decreasing [00:01:12].

This situation presents the Kremlin with a clear dilemma: either continue the operation with little chance of success or attempt to negotiate with Ukraine [00:01:21]. To facilitate negotiations with Ukraine, the Kremlin understands it must engage with the West [00:01:37]. Consequently, Russia has been sending both overt and covert signals to the West regarding potential negotiation terms [00:01:42].

The Kremlin's current desired conditions for a peace treaty are significantly scaled back from its initial goals, now appearing "almost minimal" from Moscow's perspective [00:01:57]. These conditions include:
*   Complete control of Donbass [00:02:15].
*   Ukraine's recognition of Crimea as Russian [00:02:18].
*   Donbass being recognized as independent or eventually part of Russia [00:02:22].
*   A land corridor to Crimea [00:02:26].

## Western Response and Internal Divides

The West's reaction to the Kremlin's overtures has been largely negative [00:03:23]. An example of Russia's direct engagement was a conversation between Russian Defense Minister Shoigu and US Defense Minister Austin, the first since February 18 [00:02:49]. This discussion was initiated at Russia's request [00:03:18].

There are differing positions within the West:
*   **France and Germany** would be open to an agreement based on Russia's proposed conditions [00:03:31]. French President Macron even suggested to Ukrainian President Zelensky that territorial concessions to Russia could lead to a peace treaty, though Zelensky refused [00:03:35]. Germany has also shown its stance by delaying weapon supplies to Ukraine [00:03:51].
*   The "Saxon bloc," comprising **Great Britain, the United States, Poland, and the Baltic countries**, advocates for continuing the war until a "victorious end" [00:04:05]. Ukraine aligns with this position, feeling confident in its ability to achieve decisive success and regain all its territory, beyond merely restoring the pre-February 24, 2022, status quo [00:04:22]. While the speaker views Ukraine's hopes as "exaggerated," the Ukrainian leadership is actively fostering patriotism and optimism within society [00:04:53].

While the "collective West" desires a swift peace treaty to end the conflict [00:05:10], Russia, specifically the Kremlin and Putin, cannot afford to "leave empty-handed," as this would constitute an admission of defeat [00:05:22]. The term "capitulation" has even appeared in the lexicon of Russian officials, which was previously unheard of [00:05:41].

The West is also committed to avoiding an escalation of the conflict and has repeatedly made it clear to Putin that it is not interested in the conflict expanding territorially or reaching a "qualitatively new level" [00:06:02].

## Russia's Military Options and Information Strategy

In response to Ukraine's stated readiness to mobilize up to a million people and plans for a counteroffensive to fully reclaim its territories [00:06:22], Russia has two primary instruments at its disposal:
*   **Mobilization:** A hidden mobilization is already underway in Russia, drawing from the reserve created in 2015 [00:07:03]. A mass public mobilization, if announced, is anticipated to occur after an upcoming operation for President Putin [00:07:24].
*   **Use of non-conventional weapons:** This refers to weapons of mass destruction [00:06:57].

In the absence of military successes, the Russian Ministry of Defense has been issuing sensational news reports [00:07:50]. Examples include:
*   An alleged attempt to infect residents of the LPR with tuberculosis via fake bills, drawing a historical parallel to Soviet rumors of Americans poisoning chewing gum and cigarettes [00:08:17].
*   Reports on the Pentagon's experiments in a psychiatric hospital in the Kharkov region [00:09:04].

These "loud" news items are intended to occupy the information space when there are no other reports of military successes or victories [00:09:16]. They are launched, gain attention, and then "die a natural death," serving primarily to fill the public information space [00:09:44].

## Economic Situation and Public Perception

Last week, President Putin held an economic meeting, conveying an optimistic outlook [00:10:21]. His statements suggested that Russia is successfully overcoming sanctions, which are purportedly to its advantage, and that the ruble is demonstrating the best dynamics among all world currencies [00:10:33]. He contrasted this with the West's problems of unemployment, inflation, and falling GDP [00:10:49]. The speaker compared this rhetoric to old Soviet jokes about Brezhnev's speeches, where capitalism was collapsing while socialism was at the bottom [00:11:03]. This economic optimism is seen as an "injection of optimism" to the people [00:11:35].

However, the reality behind this optimism is grim [00:12:30]:
*   Bloomberg reports that the Ministry of Finance forecasts a GDP fall of 12% in Russia [00:12:38]. Under a pessimistic scenario, Russia's isolation from world markets, especially oil sales, could lead to a decline of up to 25% over two years, an unprecedented drop [00:12:47].
*   This decline is projected to be the most significant in 94 years, effectively wiping out "all economic achievements over the past 10 years" [00:13:11].
*   While the ruble has strengthened, individual incomes have decreased, and prices have risen [00:14:04].
*   Car sales in Russia collapsed by almost 80% in April [00:14:36], indicating a decline in societal well-being.
*   AvtoVAZ, a major Russian car manufacturer, is now offering models from the early 1990s due to the absence of imported components, particularly automotive electronics [00:14:51].
*   Unemployment is a growing threat, with one-fifth of companies initiating mass layoffs and another third considering it [00:15:26].

## Societal Manipulation and Patriotism

The government attempts to compensate for the worsening social and economic reality with "injections of optimism" and, more importantly, "injections of patriotism" [00:15:59]. This includes:
*   Introducing history lessons from the first grade, which are expected to become "political information" sessions [00:16:08].
*   Restoring the All-Union Pioneer Organization on May 19 [00:16:39].

The speaker criticizes the government's approach as trying to move forward "with its head turned back" to the past for examples [00:16:48]. He posits that the more the government speaks about patriotism and calls for patience, the worse the real state of affairs in the country, indicating lower incomes and poorer prospects [00:17:12]. Such "state-owned" patriotism, which suggests people must live worse for the sake of the country, is viewed as causing disgust and rejection [00:17:53].

Notably, five governors were removed last week, which the speaker implies was a fortunate outcome for them as they will avoid accountability in a position that has become "frankly shot" [00:18:12]. High-ranking officials in Russia resign only by order of the supreme leadership [00:18:33]. Some other officials slated for removal in the coming days might face imprisonment [00:18:52].

The situation is described as "phantasmagoric" [00:19:14], and the speaker emphasizes the importance of mutual support, protecting human dignity, common sense, and moral values in Russia [00:19:29].

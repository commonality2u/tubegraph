Valery Solovey discusses the strategic situation of the [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russian Federation]], particularly concerning President Vladimir Putin, as of January 8th, in the 47th episode of "What's Happening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. He proposes reflecting on the concept of a "strategic trap," a term he has used frequently over the past year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Defining a Strategic Trap

Solovey had previously stated there was a great risk that [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russia]] would fall into a strategic trap, a thesis he repeated several times last spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. A strategic trap is a concept not only used in military art but also applicable in business and other fields where strategy is employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

It is characterized by two main features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>:
1.  **Fundamental Inability to Achieve Goals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>: One party in a conflict is fundamentally unable to achieve its political, or rather, military-political, goals by military means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
2.  **Continued Escalation of Effort** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>: Despite this fundamental inability, the party continues to increase efforts to achieve these goals, which are often obviously unattainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Historical and Current Examples

Strategic traps are situations in which superpowers have found themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Examples include:
*   The United States in Vietnam (1965-1973) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   The United States in Afghanistan (2001-2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   The Soviet Union in Afghanistan (1979-1989) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   Modern [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russia]] in [[ukraine_russia_conflict_analysis | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

These traps have historically been long-lasting, but Solovey believes [[military_situation_in_ukraine_and_russias_challenges | Russia's current situation]] may not be as prolonged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Outcomes of Strategic Traps

All the mentioned historical situations ended with withdrawal and political defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This wasn't necessarily a military defeat in all cases (e.g., the Soviet-supported Afghan leadership held out for some time after Soviet withdrawal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Over these decades, the United States and the Soviet Union wasted colossal resources to no avail, eventually making belated political decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Reasons for Falling into Strategic Traps

Countries (or even corporations) fall into strategic traps due to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>:
1.  **Overestimation of Own Power** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>: Overestimating one's economic and military strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
2.  **Underestimation of Enemy Strength** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>: Underestimating not only the opponent's military power but also the ability of civilians to act as a permanent reservoir of resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
3.  **Misunderstanding the Theater of Operations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>: The party holding the initiative fails to understand the significance of the specific characteristics of the theater of military operations (e.g., jungles in Vietnam, mountainous terrain in Afghanistan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
4.  **Underestimation of Strategic Context** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>: An error in assessing the broader strategic context is particularly important in the case of modern [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Historically, this could involve the confrontation between superpowers providing assistance (e.g., the Soviet Union and China aiding North Vietnam, the West aiding Afghanistan against the Soviets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. In the current [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia Ukraine conflict]], the West provides significant assistance to [[russia_and_ukraine_conflict_dynamics | Ukraine]] in the form of equipment, intelligence, technologies, and even manpower (Western PMCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## Reasons for Persisting in Strategic Traps

Even with predictions about the dangers of staying in such situations, countries persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>:
1.  **Arrogance of Power** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>: The hope that superior economic and military potential will eventually prevail. This "arrogance of power" was characteristic of the United States in Vietnam and Afghanistan, and the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, and now applies to [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russia's actions]] in [[russia_and_ukraine_conflict_dynamics | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
2.  **Cognitive Delusion** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>: Like a casino player who constantly increases stakes to recoup losses, military-political leaderships can suffer from cognitive delusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Examples include Secretary McNamara's proposals to increase US military presence in Vietnam and the Soviet Union's behavior in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russia's "energy war"]] against [[russia_and_ukraine_conflict_dynamics | Ukraine]] is cited as a similar desire to raise stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This is akin to a business not wanting to fix losses and continuously investing in losing projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
3.  **Distorting Properties of Religion/Ideology** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>: While not typical for the US or Soviet Union (though ideology had an effect), this was significant in the Iran-Iraq war, which lasted eight years and resulted in over 1.5 million casualties due to a passionate, heated ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## Why Authoritarian Regimes Persist Longer

While cognitive delusions affect all people and political systems, authoritarian leaders are more prone to persisting in these delusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Only countries with colossal economic and military potential—superpowers like the United States or the Soviet Union, or Iran with its fervent ideology—can afford to prolong such situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

Less powerful, even economically developed, countries are quickly forced to abandon conflicts and seek reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Democratic systems have an advantage because criticism and competition force leaders to react faster to resource depletion, fearing electoral loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This explains why conflicts over the past 200 years have averaged 3-4 to 16-18 months in duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Authoritarian leaders persist in conflicts because losing or exiting on terms they perceive as dishonorable is fraught with the loss of political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Solovey emphasizes that strategic traps are not the result of conspiracy theories; leaders willingly enter these situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Once deeply stuck, opponents will wage a war of attrition, as the US did aiding Afghan dushmans, and the West is now doing by intensifying aid to [[russia_and_ukraine_conflict_dynamics | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. This provides an opportunity to deliver a decisive blow to the military power of the [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russian Federation]] and discourage its future use of military force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. This opportunity was "personally provided" by President Vladimir Putin himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

When the US and NATO invaded Afghanistan, they consulted [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russia]], whose experts unanimously advised against it, citing the Soviet Union's negative experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. However, the "third person effect" fallacy ("you lost, but we will win") led them to ignore this advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

## [[military_situation_in_ukraine_and_russias_challenges | Russia's Current Situation]] and Prospects

Unlike the Soviet Union, [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russia]] is not a superpower in terms of resource potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
*   [[russian_economic_issues_and_potential_crises | Russia's GDP share]] in the world is 1.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
*   The United States is 23% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.
*   The European Union is 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.
*   Adding Japan and South Korea, who are not on [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russia's side]], reveals an "incomparable colossal incomparability of economic and military potentials" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

Given this imbalance, talk of victory for [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russia]] is no longer feasible; the focus should be on conditions for an honorable withdrawal from [[ukraine_russia_conflict_analysis | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. The Russian government "blew this chance" in March of last year when ideal conditions existed for withdrawal, with [[russia_and_ukraine_conflict_dynamics | Ukraine]]'s leadership ready for concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Now, neither [[russia_and_ukraine_conflict_dynamics | Ukraine]]'s leadership nor society will make concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

The situation for the [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russian Federation]] and its leadership will worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. For an "honorable exit" that could be presented as a victory, Putin is ready to do "anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. His two resources are tactical nuclear weapons and manpower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. Since modern weapons and shells are obviously insufficient, he believes [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russia's human potential]] significantly exceeds that of [[russia_and_ukraine_conflict_dynamics | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Thus, he is ready to "throw the people into the furnace of confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

Authoritarian leaders like Putin are afraid of losing power and are willing to sacrifice their own people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Putin considers losses of up to half a million people acceptable, according to "evil but very informed tongues" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. The Ministry of Defense does not confirm or refute these estimates and primarily reports on [[russia_and_ukraine_conflict_dynamics | Ukraine's losses]], which Solovey notes are often inflated to impossible levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

The main goal of the "special military operation" for Putin is to preserve his own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. However, the paradox is that every day he weakens his own power, as those around him and in [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_public_opinion | Russian society]] understand that they are caught in a trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

Quoting Miyamoto Musashi's "The Book of Five Rings," Solovey concludes that an "immature strategy" is the reason for sadness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. This immature strategy is characteristic of the [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russian government]] and will intensify the sadness for the country, its people, and all of [[russia_ukraine_conflict_and_public_opinion | Russian society]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

Solovey encourages viewers to support him, financially and morally, to resume streaming and continue providing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. He emphasizes that the coming year will be difficult but offers a chance to decisively influence destiny, concluding with a message of hope for victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:06">[00:25:06]</a>.

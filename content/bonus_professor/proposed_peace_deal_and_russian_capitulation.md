An emergency broadcast on November 11 reports that a strategic turning point in the armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine has been consolidated in Ukraine's favor following the withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Sensational news confirming this analytical presentation began to arrive on the evening of November 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This information was received simultaneously from several trustworthy sources and complements each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## An Offer of Capitulation
On Thursday, November 10, the Kremlin received an [[potential_peace_proposals_between_russia_and_ukraine | offer of a peace deal]] with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This [[potential_peace_negotiations_involving_russia_and_ukraine | peace proposal]], agreed upon with the Ukrainian leadership, is described as nothing less than a proposal for the capitulation of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. It is seen as the capitulation of the country as a whole, not just the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The essence of the proposal includes several demands and conditions:
*   **Withdrawal from Ukraine**: The Russian armed forces must completely leave Ukraine, including the territories of the DPR and LPR, which Russia had previously claimed as subjects of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Crimea's Status**: The status of [[demilitarization_and_territorial_agreements_involving_crimea_and_transnistria | Crimea]] is suspended for seven years, during which it will not be discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The peninsula itself is to be declared a [[demilitarization_and_territorial_agreements_involving_crimea_and_transnistria | demilitarized zone]], allowing only police and border guards with small arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The Black Sea Fleet must leave Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Demilitarized Zone on Borders**: A [[demilitarization_and_territorial_agreements_involving_crimea_and_transnistria | demilitarized strip]] 100 kilometers wide is to be introduced on the borders of Russia with Ukraine and Belarus, with no heavy weapons allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This rule would primarily apply to exclude Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Guarantor Countries**: Six countries have given consent to act as guarantors of this agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Transnistria**: Russia must leave [[demilitarization_and_territorial_agreements_involving_crimea_and_transnistria | Transnistria]] (meaning the Russian military base), and Transnistria will be included and integrated into Moldova in 2023, with Russia undertaking not to interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Ukraine's NATO Status**: Ukraine promises not to join NATO for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Reactions to the Ultimatum
The first reaction to this ultimatum from the Russian establishment has been positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This is attributed to the ultimatum offering guarantees of freedom and security to the establishment, including security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. They are guaranteed that criminal cases will not be brought against them or their families, and they will not be persecuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This top layer, which implements Putin's policy, is promised freedom, security, and the preservation of at least part of their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

The President's (Putin's) reaction is not yet clear, as he is still considering the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Signs of Acceptance or Rejection
*   If massive missile attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure (primarily power plants) are resumed, it means the president does not accept these conditions, signifying an unambiguous refusal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This aligns with [[russias_rejection_of_peace_proposals_and_subsequent_missile_strikes | Russia's rejection of peace proposals and subsequent missile strikes]].
*   If there is no shelling, it does not necessarily mean readiness to accept, but rather that reflection continues, and an attempt is being made to gain additional time to comprehend the situation and hope for a miracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Implications for Russia and Putin
If the president refuses these conditions, which the Russian establishment is ready to accept, military action will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. A military defeat of the Russian Federation is then considered highly probable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

Putin's only way to delay an inevitable defeat is to try to contain it with a nuclear threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. However, under these favorable conditions for the establishment, if the president orders the use of tactical nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction, the chances increase that his order will be blocked or not carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Such a refusal to carry out orders would de facto mean the end of Vladimir Putin's presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

Regardless of the strategic decision President Putin makes, he will have to leave office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   If Putin accepts the ultimatum, he will have to go into the shadows to save face and shift responsibility to another person, who would sign the "shameful agreement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This carries the risk of a palace coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   If the president decides in favor of continuing the military campaign, hoping for a miracle, he will inevitably become a scapegoat for its defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

The existence of these conditions, agreed upon with Ukraine and transferred by a reliable party, marks a sharp turn in Russian politics, both internationally and internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. This represents a complete and final fiasco of 22 years of Putin's rule, policy, and system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. A close historical analogy given is Russia's defeat in the Crimean War (1853-1856), where Emperor Nicholas I, who took responsibility for the defeat, effectively caused his own death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

While they find it fascinating as an intellectual, they also find it terribly scary as a citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

The program "Answers to Hot Questions" addresses the topic of Russian state propaganda and its influence on society.

## Nature and Impact of Russian Propaganda
The current state propaganda machine is described as being "imbued with Jan hatred of Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. It is characterized as "hostile to everything human, everything honest, everything fair, everything humane" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This propaganda contributes to a "zombified part of the Russian population" living in a "coma of absolute and sinister delusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Regarding [[media_manipulation_and_lies_in_russian_politics | Media Manipulation and Lies in Russian Politics]], the numbers presented from the Russian presidential elections are dismissed as "nothing more than lies and falsification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The speaker also references how [[the_influence_of_media_and_public_opinion_in_russian_politics | people in Russia]] often live by "ready-made formulas which propaganda throws at them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>, viewing this as a "process of saving energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>.

## Addressing Propaganda and Societal Change
To counter this [[public_reaction_and_propaganda_in_russia | public reaction and propaganda in Russia]], the primary step suggested is to "switch off the state propaganda machine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It is believed that after this, a "significant part of society comes to its senses immediately" within a "relatively short time up to six months" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. While not everyone will recover, a "minority will persist in their delusions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The ultimate goal is a "whole change of climate in the country from malignant to benign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, requiring the inclusion of "other narratives" on television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

However, a significant challenge remains: even when "grandiose things" happen or have already begun to happen (like personnel reshuffles and purges in the Ministry of Defense), a "considerable group of people who will shrug their shoulders and say 'Well, what are you telling us everything is as it was'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>. This phenomenon is explained as a common "cognitive error" where people are "not able to imagine a future different from the present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>. It is stated that a majority of people, "especially in Russia," are unfortunately "blind, deaf and stupid" and "don't want to understand anything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>.

### Propaganda and Leadership
The speaker also discusses the perception of Putin's existence and authority, noting that claims about Putin's relatives being appointed to government positions or his alleged palace being completed are a "very simple smokescreen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>. This is presented as an attempt to convince the public that "Putin is alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>, despite the real Putin never having appointed relatives to government positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>. This highlights the ongoing [[challenges_of_russian_society_and_propaganda | challenges of Russian society and propaganda]] related to leadership legitimacy.

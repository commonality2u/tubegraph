## Initial Sanctions and Differentiated Approach
The Russian oligarchy has been "squeezed" by sanctions, with many major figures, including Usmanov, Mordashov, Temchenko, and Berg, being added to US sanctions lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. The West has adopted a "differentiated approach" towards Russian elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Certain figures, described as "seasoned" like Timchenko, Rotenberg, and Kovalchuk, face a merciless stance from the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Others, like Abramovich and Usmanov, have been given "some leeway" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. For instance, Abramovich was not formally included in sanctions, though he was pressured to sell his assets and advised not to come to London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Usmanov's assets in the US were not entirely frozen, suggesting an opportunity for him to "decide the issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Similarly, Usmanov's business remains unsanctioned in Britain, despite personal sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

This implies that some oligarchs are expected to "do something about Putin and the war in Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Abramovich, for example, publicly stated his indirect involvement in negotiations between Moscow and Kyiv, which is seen as a way to avoid sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Putin's Disconnect from Old Elites
Despite their past influence, many "old school" oligarchs are no longer close to Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. For the last two years, figures like Abramovich have not been able to meet with the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Only those in the "first category of citizens," such as Kovalchuk, Rotenberg, and Demchenko, can still meet him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Even Sobyanin and Valentin Yumashev, who were historically very close to Putin and instrumental in his rise, can no longer meet him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

There is a "non-aggression pact" between the [[internal_conflicts_within_the_russian_elite | old elite]] and the government: the old elite does not attack the government, finance the opposition, or engage in "fingers in investing," and in return, Putin does not touch them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. However, these oligarchs are now unable to influence Putin or the generals to stop the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

> "To assume that they can know some generals to build history in the spirit of a cloak and dagger this of course is completely noticeable but Vladimir Vladimir all this was provided for part the whole composition of his yew guards what is called a fly will not fly that is an enemy right now at this moment it will definitely not penetrate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>

The West's pressure is working for the future, aiming to increase pressure on officials after the oligarchs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>. This means targeting their families and properties abroad, as exemplified by Peskov, whose family lives in Great Britain and France, and whose wife is a US citizen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. Sanctions are expected to broaden and deepen, encompassing "all new groups" and extending to family relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>.

## Effectiveness of Western Pressure
The current sanctions regime is viewed as an "economic war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>. While the West hopes to influence Russian elites to act against Putin, the speaker believes this is currently impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.

> "now even if the americans put a knife the british with their inherent elegance knife to the throat or forward to the temple night of this or that oligarch he even from pants cutouts here will jump out and will not be able to do anything this is absolutely certain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>

The elites' instruments of influence have disappeared, with no independent media to offer an alternative viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. They are politically "helpless" despite their wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. Statements from companies like Lukoil and Deripaska, while expressing concern, are not sufficient to challenge the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:4:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

The West's objective is to reduce Russia's GDP by half within several months to a year, an "unprecedented achievement" driven by Russia's own actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. Even if Russia stops the escalation in Ukraine, existing sanctions will remain, meaning the situation will not return to pre-war conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. This [[western_countries_stance_towards_russias_leadership | stance of Western countries towards Russia's leadership]] indicates a long-term economic war.

## Outlook for Russian Society
The general public, unlike the elites, has not yet fully felt the impact of sanctions due to propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. However, mass unemployment, shortages of food and medicine, and logistical disruptions are expected to lead to severe economic hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. These "different hells" were created by the efforts of one person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

People will begin to experience what a "deficit" truly is, reminiscent of the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. The expected economic downturn and potential mass mobilization are seen as factors that could eventually lead to widespread discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

> "I'm talking about the prospect of mobilization about this not in communication unemployment mobilization it's all in one package those rumors about the introduction of martial law in full or in part that go they are actually quite justified because now according to American estimates Russia uses 90 percent of those selected for this battle in Ukraine already 90 percent everything is already running out of reserves no more I'll start I press needed need to introduce a reserve and plus in general it's not bad to occupy future unemployed with something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>

Despite the grim outlook, there's a belief that "something will break" in the current political trajectory, though "very terrible months" must first be endured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>.

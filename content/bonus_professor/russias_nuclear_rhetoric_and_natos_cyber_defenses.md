The ongoing conflict and geopolitical tensions between Russia and the West have brought focus to two critical areas: the potential for [[natos_preparation_for_hybrid_warfare | hybrid warfare]], particularly cyberattacks, and Russia's use of [[nuclear_threat_and_international_tensions | nuclear rhetoric]]. These elements are intertwined, forming a complex security challenge that both sides are preparing for.

## NATO's Preparation for Hybrid Warfare
A key topic of discussion is the assertion that [[natos_preparation_for_hybrid_warfare | NATO is preparing for a hybrid war]] with the [[geopolitical_tensions_and_russias_international_relationships | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This preparation is a response to perceived [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russian military and political strategies]] that aim to change the strategic context of the confrontation with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The idea is to divert the West's and NATO's attention to another theatre of military operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>, similar to what occurred with the new theatre in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### Potential New Areas of Tension
There is a belief that a new field of tension could be created in Europe, specifically in the Baltic countries of Latvia and Estonia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. These countries are noted for having a significant proportion of "non-native" or Russian-speaking populations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. The [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russian leadership]] is reportedly considering and testing the tools for a hybrid operation in relation to these nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

### Characteristics of Hybrid Operations
A hybrid operation is distinct from a full-fledged military operation. It involves the military component only at the final, less significant stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. The initial stages of such an operation are designed to create chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Among the effective tools for achieving this, cyberattacks are prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. These include attacks on the websites of banking, logistics, state, and municipal institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. The [[russian_military_actions_and_global_reactions | Russian Federation]] has recently been testing its capabilities to disrupt such sites and damage navigation systems in the Baltic Sea area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

If NATO does not resist these staged hybrid operations, they could escalate to the inclusion of a military component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

## NATO's Response and Article 5
NATO's stance on [[natos_preparation_for_hybrid_warfare | hybrid warfare]] and cyberattacks has been clarified. Last week, NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg stated that NATO could invoke Article 5 on collective defense in the event of a serious cyberattack on one of its member countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. He further added that Moscow would be warned about the potential use of Article 5 if a serious cyberattack occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. NATO's response would not only be in cyberspace but also "in other areas to protect NATO allies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Article 5 considers an armed attack on one NATO member as an attack on the alliance as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>, and this principle now extends to hybrid operations, even at their initial stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

However, there is speculation that NATO might initially respond with "deep concern," calling for restraint and de-escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>, as it has historically been hesitant to give a tough response due to fear of escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>.

## Russia's Nuclear Rhetoric
The discussion also highlights the issue of [[nuclear_threat_and_international_tensions | Russia's nuclear rhetoric]]. If NATO responds to cyberattacks by conducting its own cyberattacks on [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russian sites]] or by responding in non-cybersecurity fields, Russia might declare this as a threat, entitling it to use [[nuclear_threat_and_international_tensions | nuclear weapons]], including tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

Despite this rhetoric, it is believed that the current [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russian military-political leadership]] does not intend to use nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. An attempt to use tactical nuclear weapons was reportedly close to implementation in March 2022 against Ukrainian targets, but was prevented by "extraordinary efforts of a group of brave people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. While the current leadership is largely not a supporter of nuclear weapons use, it continues to employ [[nuclear_threat_and_international_tensions | nuclear vocabulary]], rhetoric, and blackmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

The parties are currently exchanging threats: Russia hints at hybrid operations and tests NATO's response capabilities, while NATO affirms its serious consideration of the threat and readiness to respond symmetrically and asymmetrically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>. The speaker's long-standing warnings about the seriousness of hybrid operations align with NATO's current attitude towards this prospect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

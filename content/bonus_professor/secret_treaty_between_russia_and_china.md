The primary focus of the May 20, 2024, program "What is Happening" by Valery Solovey was the recent [[russian_delegation_visit_to_china | trip of the Russian delegation to Beijing]] and a secret agreement between Russia and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. This agreement, signed in February 2022, is considered to be a pivotal factor in [[russiachina_relations_and_influence | Russo-Chinese relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

## The Secret Agreement
This "secret treaty," reportedly signed by the late President Vladimir Putin with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in February 2022, on the eve of the Beijing Olympics, grants China significant influence over Russian territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. The agreement remains hidden from the general Russian public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

### Price for Support
The treaty is described as the price the late President Putin was willing to pay for China's support of the "notorious special military operation" in Ukraine, which was intended to be a "victorious blitzkrieg" but turned into protracted military actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

### Characterization as Treason
The speaker unequivocally characterizes this agreement as an "act of national treason" on the part of President Putin, according to Russian law and international standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. The current Russian leadership, at least in part, is reportedly ready to implement this act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.

## The Beijing Visit and the Treaty
The recent [[russian_delegation_visit_to_china | visit of the Russian delegation to Beijing]] was profoundly shaped by this secret agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

### Moscow's Goals
Moscow's primary goals for the visit included:
*   **Legitimization of the double**: To have China accept the "double" as president, hoping the rest of the world would follow suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.
*   **Influence on Ukraine Summit**: To ask [[chinas_geopolitical_stance_and_its_impact_on_russia | China]] to put pressure on the Russian Federation not to participate in the Swiss summit on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.
*   **Military Support Guarantees**: To secure guarantees of continued [[chinas_stance_on_russia_and_ukraine_conflict | Chinese support]] for military operations against Ukraine, particularly concerning dual-use products, which are critically important for Russia's military actions and economic stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   **Bank Payments**: To resolve issues with bank payments stuck in or returned by Chinese banks, which significantly hinder mutual trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>.
*   **Power of Siberia 2**: To gain China's consent for the construction of the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>.
*   **Treaty Postponement**: To request the postponement of the secret treaty's effect due to fears of a "monstrous scandal" and domestic political crisis in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>.

### Beijing's Goals
Beijing's goals were primarily two-fold:
*   **New Leadership Assessment**: To observe the "so-called new composition of the Russian leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **Treaty Fulfillment Readiness**: To understand Moscow's readiness to fulfill the secret agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

### Outcome of the Visit
The visit was largely characterized by humiliation for the Russian delegation and a clear demonstration of [[chinas_influence_on_russian_politics | China's superior position]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

*   **Treaty Postponement**: China did not agree to postpone the treaty's effect, leaving Russia in a state of uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.
*   **Symbolic Agreements**: Several agreements were signed, but they were not very significant, though symbolically important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. One such agreement concerned cooperation on Bolshoy Usuriysky Island, which China fully claims despite its formal division with Russia, a claim to which Russia does not protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. This is seen as a hint that the Kremlin is ready to implement the secret agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.
*   **Key Issues Unresolved**: China did not agree to Russia's requests on crucial issues, including bank payments and the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:00">[16:10:00]</a>.
*   **Swiss Summit**: Just after the meeting, China stated it would not mind sending a delegation to the Swiss summit on Ukraine, though not led by Xi Jinping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>.
*   **Legitimization**: The meeting resulted in "very modest legitimization" of the "double," which the speaker considers offensive to Russia's dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.
*   **Delegation Humiliation**: The Russian delegation experienced significant humiliation, with some members even denied access to restrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>. Top figures like Sergei Chemezov and Nikolai Patrushev reportedly did not attend to avoid this humiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.
*   **"One-on-One" Meeting**: The supposed "one-on-one" meeting between Putin's "double" and Xi Jinping was not truly private; it included a translator and "controllers" from the Russian side to ensure the "double" did not say anything inappropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. No strategic issues were discussed; only praises for the Chinese leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. Chinese press reports on the "partnership without borders" also contained no specifics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Impact on Russia
> The overall outcome of the visit is seen as "frankly dangerous for Russia" because the territorial integrity and national sovereignty of the Russian Federation have been called into question due to the secret treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:46:00">[16:46:00]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that [[chinas_geopolitical_stance_and_its_impact_on_russia | China is much stronger than Russia]] in these [[russiachina_relations_and_influence | relations]], with Russia acting as a supplicant and China as a "master looking down on Moscow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

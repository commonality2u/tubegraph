Unofficial economic forecasts for Russia are becoming increasingly gloomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Economic Forecasts

According to Alfa Bank's economist Natalia Orlova, Russia's GDP is predicted to decrease by 6.5% in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. If this forecast holds true, it would represent the largest decline in Russia's GDP since 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. This contrasts sharply with official state institution forecasts:
*   The Central Bank predicts a GDP fall of only 2% to 2.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   The Ministry of Economic Development suggests a fall of less than 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

Economists not bound by state restrictions characterize the current crisis in Russia as having a different nature, implying that a quick recovery should not be expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Key factors contributing to this outlook include decreased domestic demand, export restrictions, and a general decline in investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Employment Challenges

The country is experiencing "negative employment growth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. By the end of the second quarter (early summer), 13% of Russia's working-age population, or 4.3 million people, were on unpaid leave, partially paid leave, or idle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This trend in unemployment is considered dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Societal and Demographic Declines

The fall in the birth rate in Russia was 11% in October 2022 compared to the previous October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. The population has already decreased by half a million people since the beginning of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This decline in population is seen as a sign of societal degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. The speaker suggests that the ideal being realized is for Russia to become a land free of people, ruled by an elite with a small number of servants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Government's Approach to [[economic_and_political_climate_in_russia | Challenges]]

The government's strategy to cope with the situation, as reflected in the federal budget for 2023-2025, involves a significant shift in spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   Tax collection is expected to decrease by 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   Oil and gas budget revenues are projected to decline by 24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   The budget includes a sharp reduction in economic support spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   A record increase in financing is allocated to "unarmed forces" such as the police, National Guard, FSB, and Federal Protective Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Every third ruble will reportedly go to security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. A quarter of the budget article is classified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

This strategy is described as "sitting on bayonets," with the government forgetting that such a stance can only be maintained for a very short time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

## Official Behavior Amidst [[economic_challenges_in_russia | Challenges]]

There are reports of changing behavior within the Russian establishment, particularly among officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Sources indicate that officials in political institutions are starting their day with alcohol at breakfast, adding more at lunch, along with "specific amplifiers of mental processes" to forget the "terrible present" and "even more terrible prospects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This increased alcohol consumption among officials is noted by the speaker as a common stress-relief mechanism in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

Furthermore, rumors suggest that Russian officials are actively seeking a "second homeland" or places to "lie low" if the current regime collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. While some political scientists have suggested Latin America, the speaker dismisses this, noting the predominant US influence there makes it unsafe for top Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Second and third echelon officials might get lost there without guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. Real "bases" for officials are reportedly being established in Africa, which has become "Latin America of the middle of the last century" in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. These "alternate airfields" include luxury housing, reserves of currencies and precious metals, and protection, often provided by entities like Wagner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.

The ongoing conflict between [[russia_ukraine_conflict|Russia and Ukraine]] is described as a "monstrous national tragedy" for both Ukrainians and Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. The military situation is deteriorating, with the speaker noting that "for some reason it was getting worse and worse every day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

## Military Leadership and Strategy

### General Gerasimov's Appointment
General Gerasimov was appointed as the Chief of the General Staff and commander of a group of Russian troops in the special military operation zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This appointment was a "decisive step" by President Putin to emerge victorious from the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. Gerasimov is considered the "best Russian General," an excellent planner with strategic thinking, and an author of the hybrid warfare concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. He has been endowed with special emergency powers by Putin, who demanded victory in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

The appointment of General Gerasimov was driven by two main reasons:
1.  **Purely military:** Despite the "spectacular victory" of capturing Solidarity after an assault that began in August, the situation on the fronts was not favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. The assault on Solidarity took much longer than the capture of Berlin in WWII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
2.  **Military-political:** Yevgeny Prigozhin, a protégé of Putin, had become "excessively strong" and had garnered a "galaxy of influential ill-wishers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. These individuals raised concerns to the president about Prigozhin's growing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. Prigozhin, though a "reliable and effective tool" for Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>, was reportedly preparing for a future without Putin, forming a resource base including significant finances, media control, and political influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. Gerasimov is considered one of Prigozhin's opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

### Upcoming Offensives
Both Russia and Ukraine are preparing for offensives in the coming months, likely in spring or late winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.
*   **Russian Strategy:** Could involve a combination of strategic defense against a Ukrainian offensive, followed by a transition to a counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.
*   **Ukrainian Strategy:** Might involve waiting for Russian troops to exhaust themselves in an initial offensive before launching their counterattack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. Ukraine expects to receive tanks, which are considered a "breakthrough weapon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>, although currently not enough to play a decisive role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.

The speaker anticipates this period will feature the "most significant military battle of the 21st century," referred to as the "Mother of all battles" in the steppes of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. The outcome of these military events will predetermine the political outcome of the confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>.

## Mobilization Efforts
Russia is preparing for a new stage of mobilization, which has been the subject of refuted rumors, particularly by presidential press secretary Peskov who called them "sabotage and provocations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. However, reports suggest otherwise:
*   **Hidden Mobilization:** Deferment for fathers of many children was reportedly canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. The upper age limit for conscription is being raised, potentially allowing call-ups for conscripts from 21 to 30 years old in the spring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. These measures are seen as a "hidden form of mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Service Length:** Discussions are underway to increase the length of military service to two years, likely to be resolved positively by the fall draft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
*   **Second Stage:** *The Times* newspaper, citing MI6, reported that Russia is preparing for a second stage of mobilization, potentially mobilizing up to half a million people in the first wave, with a total target of up to 2 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

These preparations indicate Russia's calculation for a long-term confrontation with Ukraine or "with the whole world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

## Economic Impact and Internal Affairs
The conflict is taking a toll on Russia's economy.
*   **Declining Oil Revenues:** Russian Urals oil, which accounts for two-thirds of Russia's oil exports, fell below $40 per barrel (to $38.7) at the end of the previous week, a record low since summer 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>. This decline will lead to serious budget problems, especially with a price ceiling being introduced from February 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[01:13:27]</a>. Russia stands to lose $100-180 billion in foreign exchange earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[01:13:36]</a>.
*   **Budgetary Shifts:** Losses will be compensated "at our expense" (the public's expense) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[01:13:53]</a>. Armed forces and security services (Russian Guard, police, FSB, Federal Protective Service) will be financed to the maximum, while social expenses and economic development spending will be cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[01:14:02]</a>. This is likened to "guns instead of oil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24:00">[01:14:24]</a>. To offset losses, Russia is attempting to increase oil exports, with January showing a sharp increase compared to December <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[01:14:41]</a>.

### Suspicious Deaths
A series of "strange deaths" of defense industry figures has occurred:
*   **Pavel Kamenev:** Scientific director of Almaz-Antey and developer of "Caliber" missiles, died on January 9 at age 85 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[01:15:13]</a>.
*   **Vladimir Nesterov:** General director of the Khrunichev center, who led the project to create heavy missiles, died on December 28 at age 73 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[01:15:43]</a>.
*   **Alexander Buzakov:** General director of the Admiralty shipyards and manufacturer of "Caliber" missiles, died on December 24 at age 66 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[01:16:08]</a>.
These three deaths in the defense industry "do not look like a coincidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[01:16:26]</a>.

## Geopolitical Landscape
The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) is described as "breathing on lat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[01:11:29]</a>, with its fate "predetermined" this year. Armenian leader Pashinyan's statement that Russia is not a defense threat and that the UN should be approached for peacekeepers indicates the CSTO's diminishing relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[01:11:15]</a>. Its continued existence will largely depend on the military dynamics in Ukraine; a Russian defeat, whether crushing or moderate, would cause the CSTO to "lose all meaning of its existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[01:11:45]</a>.

The speaker also mentions rumors that the Russian president's alleged trip to Ufa was carried out by one of his "doubles," likening it to Akira Kurosawa's film *Kagemusha* (Shadow of the Warrior) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[01:17:23]</a>.

The year 2023 is anticipated to be pivotal, offering a chance to "decisively influence our destiny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:43:00">[01:21:43]</a>, with the speaker expressing confidence that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:12:00">[01:22:12]</a>.

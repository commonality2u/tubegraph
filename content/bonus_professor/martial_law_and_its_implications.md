[[russia_moving_toward_martial_law | The introduction of martial law]] is "inextricably linked" with mobilization, regardless of which precedes the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. The decision for mobilization can only be made by the President, relying on federal laws and potentially new legal acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Legal Framework
Key laws of primary importance for understanding [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law | mobilization and martial law]] include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>:
*   Federal Law 31: "On mobilization preparation and mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Federal Constitutional Law: "On Martial Law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   Law: "On military duty and military service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Definition of Mobilization
Mobilization is defined as the transfer of the country's state structures, economy, and everyday life to a war footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. It can be partial, affecting specific territories, or full national mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Even if it starts as partial, there is a high probability it will develop into a full national mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Grounds for Martial Law
Reasons for the [[introduction_of_martial_law_and_restrictions | introduction of martial law]], as listed in the Law on Martial Law, include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>:
*   Bombing of Russian Federation territory by foreign armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   An attack by the armed forces of a foreign state on the armed forces of the Russian Federation, regardless of their location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Exile of armed gangs, groups, regular forces, and mercenaries by a foreign state to carry out aggression against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

It is noted that all three of these points are formally observable, indicating that legal grounds for the [[introduction_of_martial_law_and_restrictions | introduction of martial law]] and subsequent [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law | announcement of mobilization]] already exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Implications for Citizens

### Who is Subject to Mobilization?
Citizens in the reserve who do not have a formal deferment are subject to conscription for military service for mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This primarily includes men with a military ID aged 18 to 50 years with fitness categories 'A' (fully fit) and 'B' (fit with minor restrictions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

*   **Limited Fit (Category D):** Those with category 'D' (limited fit) who do not serve in peacetime due to health problems but receive a military ID after 27 years old, can also be mobilized from 27 to 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Women:** Women with necessary education and military registration specialties, primarily medical, are also subject to conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Categories:** Those in the reserve are distributed among three categories:
    *   First category: Men under 35 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
    *   Second category: Up to 45 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
    *   Third category: Up to 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
    The first category will be called first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### Who is Not Subject to Mobilization?
Generally, those who have not served and have not received a military ID up to 27 years old are not considered to be in the reserve and are not subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This includes students of scientific educational institutions studying in the scientific form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. However, new legal acts may change this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

A deferment can be received by <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>:
*   Persons liable for military service reserved for civilian needs (Category 'G' - temporarily not fit for military service) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   Those caring for relatives or disabled people requiring supervision, confirmed by medical certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   Guardians of minor brothers or sisters if there are no other guardians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Parents with four or more dependent children up to 16 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   Single parents and pregnant women after 22 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   Senators and State Duma deputies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   Those with an unexpunged conviction for a serious crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a> (though petty hooliganism makes one subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>).
*   Those with category 'D' (generally not fit for military service) from the draft board <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   Certain categories of citizens may be granted deferment by the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Mobilization Process and Enforcement
Citizens subject to conscription are obliged to appear at assembly points within the timeframes specified in mobilization orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Orders can be delivered at home or workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. An organizational plan assumes that not only military registration and enlistment office employees but also police or Russian Guard patrols will present summons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

When mobilization is announced, those registered for military service are prohibited from leaving their place of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. If they receive orders or summons, they are obliged to appear at military commissariats or other authorities performing these functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

Valid reasons for not appearing on summons according to federal law include illnesses or conditions leading to loss of ability to work, serious health conditions of certain relatives, or the death of relatives (e.g., to participate in a funeral) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Financial and Travel Restrictions
To stimulate appearance for mobilization, decisions were made to block bank accounts and cards of those subject to mobilization, and to close travel abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

*   **Financial Advice:** It is advised to transfer money to relatives' accounts or withdraw cash in advance if mobilization is a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Travel Advice:** It is technically important to keep a foreign passport in a safe place for quick access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### Penalties for Evasion
In peacetime, failure to appear on a military enlistment office summons incurs administrative liability in the form of a warning or a fine of 500 to 3000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Evasion of military service under Article 328 of the Criminal Code in peacetime provides for a fine of up to 200,000 rubles or imprisonment for up to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The speaker notes that penalties in wartime are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

> "It is better to lose a little money than a precious life and no less precious health" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

### Broader Economic [[impact_of_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | Impact]]
Mobilization is not just a call for military service; it involves the transfer of the entire country, including the already frail Russian economy and the not very strong Russian financial and banking system, onto a military footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This also affects private businesses, as material and technical resources, such as cars for transporting mobilized people, may be needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. Estimates from those who promised to block bank cards of mobilized individuals suggest that after such actions, the country will "finally plunge into financial [hell]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>.

### Geographic Impact
Mobilization will primarily affect residents of small and medium-sized cities, and only last of all large cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Call to Action
Citizens are urged to think and decide on strategies now, as when "time X" comes, there will be no opportunity to think, only to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. It is advised to decide with family or oneself and develop an algorithm of actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

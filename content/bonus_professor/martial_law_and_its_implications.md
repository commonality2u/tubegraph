From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The decision to mobilize is inextricably linked with the introduction of [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Whether [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] precedes or follows mobilization is not fundamental, as they are inseparable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Mass [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] is expected to be announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Legal Grounds for Mobilization and Martial Law

Key laws of primary importance for citizens include:
*   Federal Law 31 on mobilization preparation and [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Federal Constitutional Law on [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | Martial Law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   Law on military duty and military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Mobilization is defined as the transfer of the country's state structures, economy, and everyday life to a war footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Decisions on [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] can only be made by the president, based on federal laws and potentially new legal acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

A decision on [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] can involve either [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | partial mobilization]] in specific territories or full national [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. It is assumed that even if [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] starts as [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | partial]], it will likely develop into a full national [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Grounds for Introducing Martial Law

The law on [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] lists reasons for its introduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The speaker highlights three reasons most relevant to the current case:
1.  Bombing of Russian Federation territory by foreign armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
2.  Attack by foreign armed forces on Russian Federation armed forces, regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
3.  Exile of armed gangs, groups, regular forces, and mercenaries by a foreign state to carry out aggression against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

It is stated that all three of these points are formally observable, providing legal grounds for the introduction of [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] and subsequent [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation has repeatedly warned of potential provocations, such as the use of chemical means by Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

## Who is Subject to Mobilization?

Citizens in the reserve without a formal deferment are subject to conscription for military service for [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

*   **Men**: Those with a military ID, aged 18 to 50 years, and with a fitness category for the army (fully fit 'A' and fit with minor restrictions 'B') can be mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Limited Fit ('V' category)**: These individuals do not serve in peacetime due to health issues, but after age 27, they receive a military ID and can be mobilized between 27 and 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Women**: Not all women are subject to conscription, only those with the necessary education and military registration specialty, primarily medical but not exclusively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

Those in the reserve are categorized:
*   **First Category**: Men under 35 years old (privates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Second Category**: Up to 45 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   **Third Category**: Up to 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
These categories will be called upon for [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] starting with the first category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Recommendation
> The speaker suggests that those who display the "Z" symbol on their cars, supporting the special military operation, should be in the first category for [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] as a "worthy proof of their views" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Who is Not Subject to Conscription?

*   Those who have not served and have not received a military ID up to 27 years old are not considered in the reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Students of scientific educational institutions studying in the scientific form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. However, new legal acts could change this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   Persons liable for military service reserved for civilian needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   Category 'G' (temporarily not fit for military service) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   Individuals caring for relatives or disabled people with confirmed illness or need for supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   Guardians of minor brothers or sisters if there are no other guardians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Parents with four or more children dependent up to 16 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   Single parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   Pregnant women after 22 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   Senators and deputies of the State Duma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   Those with an unexpunged or unexpunged conviction for a serious article of crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Petty hooliganism, however, would still make one subject to [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Those who received category 'D' at the draft board, meaning generally not fit for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   Certain categories of citizens may be granted deferment by the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## Conscription Process and Enforcement

All citizens subject to conscription are obliged to appear at assembly points within the timeframes specified in [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. These orders can be delivered at home or work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

In the organizational and technical plan for [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_raussia | mobilization]], it is assumed that summons will be presented by employees of the military registration and enlistment office, potentially accompanied by police patrols or Russian Guard patrols, to prevent evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

Upon the announcement of [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]], those registered for military service are prohibited from leaving their place of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. If orders or a summons are received, they are obligated to appear at military commissariats or other authorities performing similar functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

Valid reasons for not appearing on summons, according to the federal law on military duty and military service, include:
*   Illnesses or conditions causing loss of ability to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   Serious health condition of certain relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   Death of relatives requiring participation in a funeral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Technical Measures to Stimulate Compliance
> To encourage compliance with [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]], decisions have been made to block bank accounts and cards of those subject to [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Additionally, travel abroad will be closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

## Punishment for Evasion

In peacetime, not appearing on a summons from the military registration and enlistment office incurs administrative liability, typically a warning or a fine from 500 to 3000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Evasion of military service falls under Article 328 of the Criminal Code, which in peacetime can result in a fine of up to 200,000 rubles or imprisonment for up to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The speaker notes that punishments in wartime may differ as [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] will likely be declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

The speaker quotes a saying: "It is better to lose a little money than a precious life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, adding "and no less precious health" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Advice

[[General_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | Mobilization]] is not just a call for military service; it involves transferring the entire country to a military footing, including the already fragile Russian economy and its financial and banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. This could impact private businesses, potentially leading to confiscation of vehicles or other material and technical resources needed for transporting mobilized individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

According to estimates from those who promised to block bank cards, they believe that after such measures, Russia will "finally plunge into financial hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. The speaker describes Russia as a "model of social hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

> [!TIP] Planning Ahead
> Citizens are advised to think and prepare now, as it will be too late once [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] is announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Recommendations include:
> *   Transferring money to relatives' accounts or withdrawing cash in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
> *   Keeping foreign passports in a safe, easily accessible place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
> *   Considering that [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] will first affect residents of small and medium-sized cities, then large cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
> *   Developing an algorithm of actions and making decisions with family or individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

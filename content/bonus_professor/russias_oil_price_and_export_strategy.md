## Introduction of Oil Price Ceiling

The introduction of a ceiling on [[oil_prices_and_russias_global_relations | oil prices]] has been a significant economic and political event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. The consequences of this ceiling are not expected to be fully apparent until January or February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. The cap, set at $60 per barrel by Canada, Australia, the EU countries, and the G7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:21:51]</a>, is considered "comfortable" for [[oil_prices_and_russias_global_relations | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:51]</a>. In the last week of November, Russian oil sold from the Primorsk port of shipment was already priced at $52 per barrel, which is $8 below the $60 ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>.

## Russia's Response and Export Strategy

In response to the price cap, the [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russian leadership]] declared that [[oil_prices_and_russias_global_relations | Russia]] would not supply oil to countries that adopt these restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:06">[01:30:06]</a>. Despite this, 47% of all [[economic_implications_of_oil_prices_and_export_strategies | oil exports]] go to EU countries that have adopted these restrictions, with the exception of Hungary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>.

There is an expectation that oil might still be supplied to these EU countries through third countries, involving transshipment of raw materials in the open sea before being delivered to Europe under a foreign flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. Notably, [[oil_prices_and_russias_global_relations | Russia]] acquired 100 tankers in the month prior, ostensibly for delivering oil to [[chinas_stance_on_russias_oil_export_and_military_strategy | China]], India, and other Asian countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:52">[01:39:52]</a>. The European Union has also introduced legislation imposing a five-year punishment term for those who assist [[oil_prices_and_russias_global_relations | Russia]] in circumventing sanctions, indicating awareness of potential illicit activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Impact of OPEC's Decisions

The decision of OPEC regarding oil production is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. If the United States successfully pressures oil-exporting countries to increase production, raw material prices will not rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. However, if OPEC refuses to increase production, [[oil_prices_and_russias_global_relations | Russia]] may attempt to compensate for losses in its [[economic_implications_of_oil_prices_and_export_strategies | oil exports]] to Europe by an increase in the global cost of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## Economic Implications for Russia

Regardless of these strategies, the [[economic_challenges_in_russia_and_governmental_strategies | Russian budget]] is anticipated to incur losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. These losses will likely manifest in the reserve fund not being replenished as expected, and budget rules not being strictly implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. A decrease in foreign exchange earnings is projected to lead to the "printing press" being spun up, resulting in accelerated inflation within [[oil_prices_and_russias_global_relations | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

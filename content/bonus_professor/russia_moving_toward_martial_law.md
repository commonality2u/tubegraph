Russia is reportedly moving "quite quickly" and "confidently" towards the [[introduction_of_martial_law_and_restrictions | introduction of full or partial martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This development is prompted by recent events and a growing atmosphere of tension within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Catalyzing Events

A series of incidents have contributed to an urgent and tense atmosphere across Russia:

*   **Kremlin Drone Attack** On the night of May 2-3, 2023, the Moscow Kremlin was reportedly attacked by drones of unknown origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. These drones are believed to be 99.99% Ukrainian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The Kremlin's swift public acknowledgment of the attack is seen as an admission that "things are not going very well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The attack itself was symbolic, aiming to show the Kremlin's vulnerability and that "the Russian flag has fallen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. It was not intended to strike President Putin, who is known to rarely be in the Kremlin, preferring deep bunkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Previous Military Actions** Prior to the Kremlin attack, there were other "truly military" incidents, including sabotage on railway transport and an alleged foiled assassination attempt on the head of Crimea, Aksyonov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Drones have also been regularly attacking frontline areas and increasingly flying into Moscow and the Moscow region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Public and Official Reactions

An "intensive and increasingly tense hysterical atmosphere" is forming in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

*   **Public Hysteria** There is a "mania for searching and detecting Ukrainian drones" that has swept Moscow and the Moscow region since April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. On one day, up to 100 calls were received from eyewitnesses claiming to have seen drones, though the "overwhelming majority" of these calls are considered "absolute nonsense" driven by fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Authorities' Response** Due to this mania, Moscow authorities have ordered public utilities to monitor the capital's airspace, leading to "ridiculous" scenarios reminiscent of WWII air raid vigilance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. On May 3, the Moscow mayor banned all drone launches except for "competent ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This indicates "strong nervousness" and "strong tension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Government Demands** Security Council Secretary Patrushev reportedly "demanded" that the president immediately impose [[introduction_of_martial_law_and_restrictions | martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. While [[introduction_of_martial_law_and_restrictions | martial law]] is already in effect in the "new territories," the demand was for its extension to the Russian capital, frontline regions, and potentially other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Putin's Delay** President Putin has postponed a decision on expanding [[introduction_of_martial_law_and_restrictions | martial law]] until the end of the week, as he dislikes hasty decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. It is expected that no decision will be made before May 9, presumably to allow for the Victory Day parade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Putin also understands that imposing [[introduction_of_martial_law_and_restrictions | martial law]] would diminish his power in favor of the security officers who would control its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## Implications of Martial Law

[[introduction_of_martial_law_and_restrictions | Martial law]] in Russia would involve a series of restrictions, primarily on civil rights and freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

Key restrictions could include:

*   **Civil Rights and Freedoms** Significant curtailment of existing rights and freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Travel Ban** A ban on travel outside the Russian Federation for those subject to military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. There are currently over 15 million people in the database of those potentially subject to [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Movement Restrictions** Restrictions on movement between regions, although this is more difficult to implement than border control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Passport Control** Strengthening of passport control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Freedom of Speech** A restriction on freedom of speech, impacting bloggers and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Internment** The possibility of internment, meaning detention without trial or investigation for up to 30 days, with potential extensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Conscription** Facilitation of conscription, with formal restrictions potentially being ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Mass Checks** Mass checks of those subject to conscription and military service are reportedly starting in some cities, leading to escorts of young people to military registration and enlistment offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Financial Restrictions** Theoretical blocking of bank cards and accounts for those potentially subject to [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The Central Bank has reportedly prepared for this since September 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

### Implementation Scope
The implementation of [[introduction_of_martial_law_and_restrictions | martial law]] may involve the actual implementation of its elements without a formal declaration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The scope of restrictions will likely vary by region and city, with local authorities playing a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. For example, Moscow Mayor Sobyanin is expected to try to protect Moscow citizens and maintain their loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

## Outlook
The speaker notes that these developments were foreseeable and are part of a broader trajectory for the [[russian_government_changes | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Despite the difficult situation, there is a belief that these changes will ultimately lead to "liberation," "justice," and a "different quality life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

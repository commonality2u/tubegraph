Ramzan Kadyrov is confirmed to be seriously ill, a fact publicly stated multiple times by "Ramza Ahto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The illness is described as very serious but "not fatal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

Regarding the diagnosis, the speaker's information on the causes and diagnosis of Kadyrov's illness does not align with information published by Novaya Gazeta Evropa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Political Implications and Rumors

### Succession
The question of Kadyrov's succession is currently not considered a "practical issue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Ministerial Appointment
There are rumors that Kadyrov seeks to be appointed Minister of Internal Affairs; however, this is stated to be untrue and "never been true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### Chechnya's Future
In the event of a change in Russia's leadership, a conflict with Chechnya is considered "extremely unlikely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. It is more probable that the relationship between Chechnya and the new leadership will evolve differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

The SVR General has previously stated that if his team comes to power, they would allow Chechnya to "go free floating" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This implies that if faced with a choice between war and free floating, the latter would likely be preferable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The decision for Dagestan, including parts that might wish to "sail with Chechnya," would ultimately rest with Dagestan itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Dagestan is described as a "hot sore spot for the Russian authorities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, with questions raised about the nature of its future governance and whether it will continue to be ruled by "Russian proteges and Generals who accumulate negative mood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The core issue is seen as the quality of management rather than the ethnicity of the manager, aiming to address [[current_state_of_political_and_social_issues_in_russia | corruption]], mass violence, and poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

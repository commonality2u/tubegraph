This article summarizes recent observations and discussions regarding [[Vladimir Putins health and political future | Vladimir Putin's health]] and its potential impact on Russia's political and economic future, as presented on the "What is Happening" program by Valery Solovya.

## Current State of Affairs

The program, recorded on June 5, 2022, noted that the Russian president was located in a "black stream," possibly within underground bomb shelters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>. This location was cited as a positive sign, indicating that the idea of tactical nuclear strikes on Ukraine was "off the agenda" at that moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:15">[01:30:15]</a>.

## Unfavorable Developments in the Special Military Operation

More than 100 days into the "special military operation," a "breakthrough" is not in sight for either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:13">[02:00:13]</a>. Signs indicating difficulties for Russia include:
*   Official instructions given to families not to emphasize the duration of the special military operation, suggesting it is not a "blitzkrieg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:09">[02:36:09]</a>.
*   Changes in military command: General Dvornikov, appointed in early April, disappeared two weeks prior to the recording, with Colonel General Gennady Zhidko now reportedly commanding the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:04">[02:56:04]</a>. Frequent changes in military leadership suggest operations are not proceeding as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:07">[03:26:07]</a>.

## Economic Concerns and Sanctions

While sanctions are expected to impact the Russian economy, they might not be "deadly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Russia is attempting to compensate for lost European oil exports by reorienting sales to China and India, albeit with discounts and logistical challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Methods to bypass oil sanctions include mixing Russian oil with other sources in tankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

However, personal sanctions against the Russian elite, including oligarchs, their spouses, and children, are causing significant irritation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

There is a prevalent feeling among officials and businessmen that serious economic problems will arise, particularly in August, which they refer to as the "fatal month" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. The exact nature of these problems is unclear but could involve the financial sphere, possibly a cyberattack on the banking system, or a global economic crisis affecting Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

## [[Putins health and its influence on Russian politics | Putin's Health]] and Administrative Disorganization

One potential factor for future economic instability is the "deteriorating [[putins_health_and_public_perception | health of the Russian president]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. It is considered "common place" among high-echelon Moscow officials that [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | Putin will have to leave]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. This knowledge has led to a noticeable "disorganization of the administrative apparatus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>, reminiscent of the Soviet bureaucracy's decline before the collapse of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

This uncertainty causes officials to question the wisdom of taking risks, focusing instead on personal and group tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. Some may even see it as a time for a "last grab" of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

## Public Image Management

Efforts are being made to conceal these internal developments from the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. This includes:
*   The use of doubles for public appearances, with one double being "absolutely identical" to the current president, having only "two tiny differences" detectable by a trained eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.
*   Augmented reality for video messages and conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
*   Pre-recorded "canned food" (meetings or speeches) submitted as current events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

## The Future of "Putinism"

If [[potential_consequences_of_putins_death | Putin were to leave]], the entire "Putin's system" would begin to fall apart, not immediately, but within years rather than decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. The system's core would disappear, weakening its structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

The State Council, currently being formed by Putin with personally selected personnel, is described as a "terrarium of like-minded people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>. While Putin has been able to reconcile these individuals and maintain their loyalty, it is doubtful whether they would remain united if he were to weaken and attempt to govern "from behind the scenes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. The speaker asserts that "without Putin, the Putin system is impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>.

### Political Uncertainty
The political landscape is highly uncertain. The speaker notes that it is difficult to predict anything about politics currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. There is even doubt that planned elections in September will actually take place, suggesting they could be canceled shortly before the voting date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. The summer of 2022 is anticipated to have a "very interesting outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.

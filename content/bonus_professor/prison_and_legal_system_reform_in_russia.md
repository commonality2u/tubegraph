From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The current Russian legal and penal system is described as a "Living hell" and a "social hell on earth," characterized by monstrous conditions in prisons and places of detention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02">[04:02]</a>. The overall activity of the speaker and their team aims to [[reforms_and_future_directions_for_russia | radically change the situation in the country]] and the very foundations upon which society and the state are based in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05">[02:05]</a>.

## Current State of the Penal System

Large super prisons are being constructed in 29 regions of Russia, financed by budget projects derived from taxes and deductions from energy resource sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06">[03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18">[03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40">[03:40]</a>. This project began when the number of prisoners was stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51">[03:51]</a>. The speaker suggests that the continuation of these projects, despite a changed military-political situation and differing financing needs, is linked to the embezzlement of budget money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56">[04:56]</a>. There is also an idea among some Chekists to use these new prisons as Stalin-era camps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45">[04:45]</a>.

## Proposed Reforms

The proposed reforms aim to radically change the current system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05">[02:05]</a>.

### Penal System and Political Prisoners
Under a new government, there would be significant changes to the penal system:
*   **Release of Political Prisoners**: All political prisoners, including figures like Furgal, who is considered a "classic political prisoner," would be released after a change of regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10">[12:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15">[12:15]</a>.
*   **End to Torture**: Torture is considered unacceptable in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59">[26:59]</a>.
*   **Fate of Specific Figures**: Medvedev, if no longer in power, would first undergo treatment for alcoholism, and then his fate would be decided according to the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51">[27:51]</a>.

### Broader Legal and Social Reforms
The speaker's team, representing a "third coalition," has noble and worthy goals in domestic and foreign policy, focusing on the development and security of Russia through peaceful and civilized means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16">[16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29">[16:29]</a>.

Key areas of [[reforms_and_future_directions_for_russia | reform]] include:
*   **Dismantling Tyranny**: The current system is seen as a continuation of tyranny even after Putin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31">[05:31]</a>. [[political_and_social_reforms_in_russia | Post-puncture penalties]] and a new system will arise only when the foundations of tyranny are dismantled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44">[05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46">[05:46]</a>.
*   **Judicial Reform**: While not explicitly detailing [[lustration_of_the_judicial_system_in_russia | lustration]] of the entire pedagogical corps, the speaker implies changes for those who persist in "delusions" related to election fraud, suggesting they "will be punished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:09">[25:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:32">[25:32]</a>.
*   **Economic System**:
    *   **Nationalization**: There will be nationalization of some private enterprises and strategically important assets, with new state corporations created from nationalized enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58">[13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11">[14:11]</a>. However, it is acknowledged that some assets may be distributed among "their own" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:24">[14:24]</a>.
    *   **Mandatory Labeling**: The system of mandatory labeling and certification of goods, created to enrich specific individuals, would not be supported, implying its likely cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03">[28:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:20">[28:20]</a>.
    *   **Real Estate Prices**: The team has a plan to decrease real estate prices, which would be implemented after a short-term period of chaos following a change of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:08">[26:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21">[26:21]</a>.
*   **Social Welfare**:
    *   **Pension Reform**: A real, broad, and comprehensive [[reform_of_the_russian_pension_system | pension reform]] is planned, which would include the issue of paying compensation for pensions taken away from those forced to leave Russia before the collapse of the Soviet Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:47">[30:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51">[30:51]</a>.
    *   **Social Payments**: All social payments, including for caregivers of severely disabled people, are planned to be significantly raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:39">[36:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:41">[36:41]</a>.
*   **Animal Protection**: The team is "categorically against" the monstrous conditions animals are kept in Russian circuses and against any circuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30">[11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36">[11:36]</a>. The animal protection system would be radically changed towards greater humaneness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46">[11:46]</a>. They are also "categorically against" the euthanasia of stray animals, calling for regional laws on this to be cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38">[32:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:53">[32:53]</a>.
*   **Legislation**: The State Duma is viewed as a "weak-willed and pathetic appendage" of the executive power, effectively a department of the presidential administration with no independent influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40">[34:40]</a>.
*   **Addressing Technical Degradation**: The team expects sanctions to be lifted quite quickly under their government due to consultations with Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04">[19:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17">[19:17]</a>. Additionally, the existing "import substitution" (substitution of Western products with Chinese ones) helps mitigate the problem of technical degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29">[19:29]</a>.

These [[internal_reforms_and_future_of_russian_governance | internal reforms and future of Russian governance]] are part of a broader vision for Russia. The speaker notes that despite financial and personnel challenges, there are enough resources to implement these [[future_of_russian_government_legal_reforms_and_political_prisoners | reforms and future directions for Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23">[20:23]</a>. Some tasks are short-term, others medium-term, and some require 10-12 years to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30">[20:30]</a>.

On November 16, 2022, Valery Solovyov discussed the significant implications of recent [[russian_military_actions_in_ukraine | military actions]] in Ukraine and the broader [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | military and political dynamics]]. This broadcast, the 38th episode of "What's Happening," highlighted a critical turning point in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Kremlin's Rejection of Peace Proposal

The Kremlin, specifically President Putin, rejected a peace proposal, evidenced by the launch of a massive missile strike on Ukrainian infrastructure on November 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This strike was unprecedented in scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Poland Missile Incident

A tragic incident occurred in Poland on November 15, involving missiles hitting its territory and the deaths of two Polish citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. While the investigation is ongoing and the cause remains unclear, it is unlikely this incident will become a *casus belli* or trigger NATO's Article 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. NATO does not appear interested in activating Article 5 at this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Escalation of Military Action

The rejection of the peace proposal signifies not merely a continuation of [[russian_military_actions_in_ukraine | military actions]], but an [[potential_escalation_of_military_conflict_between_russia_and_ukraine | escalation]] into a new, more dangerous phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. President Putin has reportedly adopted a strategy of "spearhead counter-escalation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Ukraine's Expected Escalation

In response to Russia's categorical rejection of peace, Ukraine is expected to receive new weapons, including long-range ammunition and missiles, as well as drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This will expand the Ukrainian armed forces' strike zone to include not only border regions but potentially Central Russia, with the radius continually increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Evidence of this potential expansion includes:
*   Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev being sent to inspect air defense systems in Central Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   The undermining of the steel key oil depot in the Varlovskaya region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   Reports of Ukrainian troops launching new offensives, including an alleged offensive on Popasnaya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Russia's Expected Actions

Russia is anticipated to continue massive shelling if it can procure enough missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. However, a full-scale offensive by Russian forces in Ukraine is deemed unlikely, as Russia has adopted a concept of "strategic defense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

Further [[russian_military_actions_in_ukraine | Russian military actions]] are likely to include:
*   A second stage of mobilization planned for after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This could be expedited if Ukrainian offensives prove successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, sending newly trained mobilized personnel to the front lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   Increased restrictions on civil liberties in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Martial law, currently applied to Ukraine's "new territories" (from Russia's perspective) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, could be extended to bordering Russian regions, and potentially to major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   Martial law would allow for curfews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, detention without trial for 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, and confiscation of private property for military needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   Further state control and mobilization of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>, with up to 40% of the economy already linked to the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## Broader Consequences

The [[potential_escalation_of_military_conflict_between_russia_and_ukraine | escalation of military conflict]] could involve NATO countries most actively assisting Ukraine, potentially leading to symmetrical strikes on these nations, such as cyberattacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. The conflict zone is expected to expand, with strikes on logistics hubs, potentially through sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

The speaker predicts that the [[militarypolitical_situation_in_russia_and_ukraine | military crisis]] will inevitably develop into a large-scale political and economic crisis for Russia, possibly leading to the collapse of Russian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This does not imply Russia's disappearance, but a profound transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

Putin's declining popularity, as indicated by internal polls, is leading authorities to "tighten the screws" further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. There is concern that this tightening could lead to the collapse of the entire structure of Russian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

The ultimate dilemma for Putin is between admitting defeat or using [[military_and_nuclear_concerns_regarding_ukraine_and_russia | tactical nuclear weapons]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. While the nuclear option is currently on hold, it is not considered taboo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Putin believes that escalation is the only way to compel the West to retreat and pressure Ukraine into a peace agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. However, the West is not expected to retreat; instead, it will increase pressure on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Russia, based on its combined power, cannot withstand the pressure of the consolidated West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

The current situation is likened to historical events such as the Crimean War (1853-1856), the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and the First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. The speaker anticipates that Russia is entering its "darkest times" in the 21st century, possibly comparable to events of 1990-1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

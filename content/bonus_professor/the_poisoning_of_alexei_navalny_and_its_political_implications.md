Political analyst and historian Valery Solovey discussed the poisoning of [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Alexei Navalny]] and its broader implications for Russian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## The Assassination Attempt on Navalny

The attempt on [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Alexei Navalny's]] life was unexpected, especially Russia's agreement to transfer him to German doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Solovey noted a "typological" similarity between the [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny]] case and an incident involving Ukrainian journalist Mikhail Tkach, suggesting a common "interested party" behind both events, not based in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>. Although the attempt on [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny's]] life was not entirely successful, he suffered very seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>.

The motivation behind targeting [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny]] is described as the Kremlin's extreme fear of [[Potential political crisis in Russia | political unrest]] and mass protests anticipated in the fall or early next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Solovey also revealed that he himself was warned in late July about a potential poisoning, similar to the circumstances of [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny's]] case, and was advised to avoid drinking tea, coffee, or storing water, due to the possibility of home infiltration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. He further stated that he knows of at least two or three other individuals on a Kremlin "liquidation list" and has warned them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

## Official Russian Reaction and Response

According to Solovey, the Kremlin is "not at all worried" about the international reaction to [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny's]] poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. Should external pressure increase, particularly if Germany finds evidence of Russian involvement, Russia plans to reject all accusations while cynically proposing a joint investigation, akin to the investigation into the Malaysian Boeing crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

The Russian leadership is reportedly "very concerned" about [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny's]] health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. There is a direct order for prioritized intelligence gathering on his condition, with information reaching the Russian leadership before public release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. For instance, reports indicate that the Russian president was informed within 10-12 hours of German doctors' attempt to bring [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny]] out of a coma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. It was a personal decision by President Putin for [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny]] to be transferred to Germany, even before any official requests for his transport, as German doctors preferred it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

## Political Future

The [[Potential political consequences for Putin and Russian establishment | political future]] of [[Death of Alexei Navalny | Navalny]] hinges on his recovery and whether he will fully regain his health, a question for which there is currently no answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

Russia is described as moving "quite quickly, confidently in the direction of introducing full or partial [[martial_law_and_its_implications | martial law]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This comes amidst a backdrop of increasing anxiety and tension following drone attacks on the Kremlin and other incidents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Secretary of the Security Council Patrushev has reportedly demanded the president immediately impose [[martial_law_and_its_implications | martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. While [[martial_law_and_its_implications | martial law]] is already in effect in the "new territories," the demand was for its extension to Moscow, frontline regions, and potentially other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. The president has postponed this decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, possibly until after May 9th, and is reportedly hesitant due to concerns about diminishing his own power in favor of security officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

Regardless of a formal declaration, it is suggested that important elements of [[martial_law_and_its_implications | martial law]] could be implemented without a formal proclamation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

## Civil Rights and Freedoms

[[martial_law_and_its_implications | Martial law]] fundamentally means a "set of [[restrictions_and_measures_taken_by_the_government | restrictions]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, primarily involving a "restriction of civil rights and freedoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

Potential [[restrictions_and_measures_taken_by_the_government | restrictions]] include:
*   **Travel Ban** For those subject to military service, there could be a ban on travel outside the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. There are reportedly over 15 million people in the database of those potentially subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, who can currently leave freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Internal Movement Restrictions** Restrictions on movement between regions could be introduced, along with strengthened passport control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Freedom of Speech** A restriction of freedom of speech is naturally expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Internment** The possibility of internment, meaning detention without trial or investigation for up to 30 days (extendable), could be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Military Service and Mobilization

The [[introduction_of_martial_law_and_restrictions | introduction of elements of martial law]] would make it "much easier to carry out conscription" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. Existing formal [[laws_related_to_military_service | restrictions]] related to military service might be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

Local police are already initiating mass checks on individuals subject to conscription and those liable for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. There are reports of groups of young people being escorted to military registration and enlistment offices for document verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>, where they are pressured to serve under contract or volunteer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## Financial and Economic Considerations

[[legal_and_financial_considerations_under_martial_law | Economic and financial restrictions]] are also possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. The Central Bank reportedly informed the president that the financial and banking system is prepared to "block bank cards and bank accounts" for those potentially liable for military service or subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. While financial authorities are not "delighted" with this prospect, they are prepared to implement it if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## Role of Local Authorities

The scope of [[restrictions_and_measures_taken_by_the_government | restrictions]] will heavily depend on the position of local authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. They will be involved in agreeing upon the set of measures to be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. It is expected that different regions and cities might have different sets of measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. For example, Moscow Mayor Sobyanin is anticipated to try and protect Moscow citizens to maintain voter loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

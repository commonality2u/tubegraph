The 25th episode of Valery Soloviev's "What's Happening" program, recorded on September 18 and released on September 19, highlights what is termed "a failure" for Russia at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This failure is analyzed across four key aspects: image/symbolic, geopolitical, economic, and physiological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Image and Symbolic Failure

The summit marked a significant downturn in [[International relations and diplomatic challenges for Russia | Russia's international standing and diplomatic challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>:
*   **Reception Protocol**: While other leaders were met by the President of Uzbekistan, Russian President Putin was met only by the Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Waiting Game**: In contrast to previous instances where others waited for him, Putin himself had to wait for four state leaders (India, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Kyrgyzstan) for talks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **Symbolic Seating**: A notable photograph from the summit depicted Turkish President Erdogan seated centrally in a chair, with Azerbaijani President Aliyev next to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Putin was positioned on a sofa between the very tall presidents of Belarus (Lukashenko) and Tajikistan, reflecting the perceived status granted to the Russian president by the summit organizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Didactic Tone**: The Prime Minister of India adopted a didactic tone with Putin, questioning "what he did not do in the 21st century wars," to which Putin made excuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Chinese Distrust**: When Putin attempted to reassure Chinese President Xi Jinping that everything was going "according to plan" in Ukraine and "all goals will be achieved," Xi smiled ironically and shook his head with "obvious distrust" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Geopolitical Failure

The summit exposed a shift in power dynamics and a weakening of [[Russias geopolitical strategy with NATO and the European Union | Russia's geopolitical influence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>:
*   **Emerging Powers**: China and Turkey are identified as the true "first" powers at the summit, successfully developing the post-Soviet space traditionally considered Russia's undivided sphere of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Kazakhstan's Sovereignty**: During a stop in Astana, Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly stated that China is the guarantor of Kazakhstan's sovereignty and territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The President of Kazakhstan demonstratively avoided communication with Putin at the summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Regional Conflicts**:
    *   The conflict between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan initially did not turn to Moscow for mediation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Putin later had to offer his services directly to the President of Kyrgyzstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
    *   In the Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Azerbaijan enjoys Turkey's support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Russia's support for Armenia is conditional, with Putin offering defense and territorial integrity guarantees only if Armenia joins a "union state," excluding Karabakh which is not formally part of Armenia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This offer, if accepted by Pashinyan, would be "suicide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **CSTO Collapse**: Moscow is not acting as a reliable mediator in CSTO affairs, leading to the inevitable collapse of the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Kazakhstan has signaled it will suspend its membership in the CSTO from the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Shifting Influence**: Russia's influence in the Greater South Caucasus is being challenged by China (mainly Central Asia) and Turkey, as well as the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Economic Failure

Regarding [[Russias economic challenges and strategy | Russia's economic challenges and strategy]] at the summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>:
*   Putin reportedly had nothing to offer participants beyond resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.
*   When Putin proposed building the "Power of Siberia 2" gas pipeline from Yamal through Mongolia to China, President Xi "shook his head ironically," indicating China has no need for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. This highlights [[Russias economic reliance on raw materials and missed opportunities | Russia's economic reliance on raw materials and missed opportunities]].

## Physiological Failure (President's Health)

Concerns were raised about President Putin's health and its impact on [[Russian internal political dynamics and leadership issues | Russia's internal political dynamics and leadership issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>:
*   Many observers at the summit noted Putin's "terrible physical and mental shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   A mini-video reportedly showed Erdogan, who himself suffers from diabetes, carefully supporting Putin's elbow to help him maintain pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   It was suggested that attending such summits is no longer physically or mentally possible for Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   A report indicated that 12 doctors awaited Putin when he visited the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   Strange statements and mannerisms from Putin suggest "something in the head of the Russian president," which is observed by "dozens and hundreds of attentive, trained eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. These observers are described as largely "unfriendly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

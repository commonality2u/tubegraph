## The "Big Three" Visit to Kyiv
On June 19, 2022, a visit by leaders from France, Germany, and Italy (referred to as the "big three") to Kyiv sparked expectations that they would persuade Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to engage in [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace talks]] with Russia and consider territorial compromises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Behind the scenes, the decision was indeed to advocate for such compromises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. It was suggested that French President Emmanuel Macron and then-Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi were the primary persuaders, with the Kremlin reportedly possessing "serious, reliable, and sensitive dirt" on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reportedly played a secondary role, merely nodding in agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

However, the public statement following the negotiations contradicted these initial intentions. It declared unconditional support for Ukraine's position, including its territorial integrity, and indicated that [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace negotiations]] would not commence without Ukraine achieving some battlefield success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:02:10]</a>. Several factors are believed to have influenced this change in stance:
*   President Zelensky's resolute position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   The firm stance of the United States, Great Britain, and a significant portion of NATO countries favoring a solution or preparation for [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_negotiations | peace negotiations]] on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   The psychological and emotional impact on the visiting leaders from their visit to Irpin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Western Support and Ukraine's Military Strategy
Following the "big three" visit, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's trip to Kyiv further confirmed the unconditional solidarity of the UK with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:35]</a>. The key focus for Ukraine and its Western partners is not merely declarative support, but substantial military assistance in terms of size and quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:54]</a>. This aid is intended to provide Ukraine with at least equality, if not decisive superiority, against the [[economic_and_political_landscape_of_russia | Russian Federation]], potentially leading to a strategic turn on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:04:09]</a>.

The United States is seen as the only nation capable of providing such decisive assistance, and it appears ready to do so despite the risk of escalating conflict with the [[economic_and_political_landscape_of_russia | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:26]</a>. Significant military aid, including weapons and personnel trained in the US and NATO countries, is anticipated by July 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:47]</a>. If this occurs, qualitative changes on the battlefield could be observed by late July or early August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:05:02]</a>.

David Arakhamia, the head of the Ukrainian negotiating group with Russia, stated that Ukraine could resume [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | negotiations]] with Russia by the end of August <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:22]</a>. This timeline is based on the expectation that Ukraine's negotiating position will be strengthened by then, due to the arrival of new weapons and anticipated significant battlefield changes, such as the potential return of Kherson to Ukrainian control or a counteroffensive in Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:06:05]</a>. However, the resumption of talks does not signify an immediate peace agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:21]</a>. Both Boris Johnson and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg have called on NATO countries to prepare for a "long campaign" and long-term assistance to Ukraine, spanning several years, encompassing military aid, support for state infrastructure, and reconstruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Kremlin's Perspective and Internal Political Dynamics
The [[kremlins_perception_of_peace_with_ukraine | Kremlin]] is also preparing for a long "special military operation" but reportedly seeks to achieve some results by the end of autumn or beginning of winter 2022, aiming to reach a final stage of armed confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:22]</a>. This urgency is linked to internal political dynamics, particularly the health of President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:36]</a>. A decision regarding the transfer or transit of power, potentially involving the gradual replacement of President Putin, may begin as early as late autumn/early winter, or even sooner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:08:02]</a>. In this context, the internal political agenda would take precedence for the Kremlin, making the ongoing [[military_and_political_situation_in_ukraine | military agenda]] an excessive burden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:19]</a>.

A recent speech by President Putin at the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum was noted for its lack of gravitas and seriousness, with the speaker comparing it to a classic Soviet joke about Leonid Brezhnev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:10:03]</a>. The expressions on the faces of gathered businessmen during Putin's speech were also observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:42]</a>.

## Emerging Anti-Patrushev Coalition in Russia
Recent observations indicate the beginning of a genuine split within Russian elites, moving beyond mere speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:11:12]</a>. An "anti-Chekist" or, more precisely, "anti-Patrushev" coalition has started to form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:22]</a>. This coalition reportedly includes prominent figures such as:
*   Roman Abramovich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:41]</a>
*   Anatoly Chubais <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:44]</a>
*   Vladimir Potanin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:46]</a>
*   Oleg Deripaska <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>

Oleg Deripaska was notably seen demonstratively not applauding President Putin during his entry at the St. Petersburg forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:12:09]</a>. This group is also associated with the "Yeltsin family," credited with launching Putin's political career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:19]</a>.

The coalition's "anti-Patrushev" designation stems from Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev's attempts to position his son, Dmitry Patrushev (Minister of Agriculture), as President Putin's successor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:49]</a>. This proposed succession is reportedly meeting with extreme resistance not only from oligarchs and civilians but also from within some power groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:13:04]</a>. While not yet a full split, a powerful elite coalition has emerged to resist power remaining solely in the hands of a security group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:21]</a>.

The alternative leadership configuration proposed by this coalition consists of:
*   Anton Siluanov (Minister of Finance) as president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:12]</a>
*   Elvira Nabiullina (Head of the Central Bank) as head of government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:14]</a>

This highlights a clear confrontation between "civilians" and "security forces" within the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:22]</a>. The "struggle for Putin's Russia" has commenced in recent weeks, driven by the elite's awareness that President Putin will soon have to relinquish or significantly diminish his role in Russian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:15:10]</a>. This struggle marks the opening of a "hunting season" for those who may pose a threat or whose departure could signal shifts in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:16:12]</a>. Recent "strange deaths of oil workers" and the sudden death of Alexey Ogarov, former head of Uralmashzavod, are mentioned as potential indicators of this heightened internal conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:49]</a>.

Citizens are encouraged to be vigilant and prepared for future opportunities to influence Russia's historical trajectory as these elite conflicts unfold, anticipating a period of difficulty and pain for the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:18:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:39]</a>.

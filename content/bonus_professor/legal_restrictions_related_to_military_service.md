Valery Solovey discusses various aspects of the upcoming second round of partial mobilization and the associated legal restrictions and potential measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This discussion addresses questions from the public regarding how these [[potential_mobilization_and_military_service_changes_in_Russia|changes]] might impact citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Potential Mobilization and Restrictions

Questions frequently concern the continuation of "partial mobilization" and potential [[restrictive_measures_for_russian_military_draft_dodgers|restrictions]] on citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The formal end of the previous "partial mobilization" has not occurred, and it is anticipated to resume with renewed vigor in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Financial Restrictions

A primary concern is the possible blocking of bank accounts and cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. While the [[legal_amendments_concerning_military_mobilization_in_russia|amendments to the law on the creation of a single register of military personnel]] do not explicitly mention this restriction, it is considered the most effective way to compel individuals to report to military enlistment offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The banking system, under Nabiullina's instructions, has reportedly been preparing for such a measure since September of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This measure would likely target those who receive electronic summonses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Other Restrictions Outlined in Law

The [[legal_amendments_concerning_military_mobilization_in_russia|law on the creation of a single register of military personnel]] includes other types of [[restrictive_measures_for_russian_military_draft_dodgers|restrictions]] for those who fail to report to military enlistment offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>:
*   A ban on traveling to the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   A ban on real estate transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   A ban on registering as an individual entrepreneur, potentially extending to general activities as an individual entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   A ban on driving a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

However, these measures may not be universally effective, as a significant portion of the population does not possess foreign passports or cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Criminal Liability for Evasion

Currently, there is no criminal punishment for evading [[mobilization_laws_and_categories_of_conscription|mobilization]] in the Criminal Code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. During the "partial mobilization," not a single person was administratively or criminally punished for evasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. It is considered unlikely that criminal liability for evasion will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Enforcement and Categories of Conscription

### Strategies for Forcing Compliance

Since criminal punishment is lacking, the authorities are likely to rely on financial [[restrictive_measures_for_russian_military_draft_dodgers|measures]] like blocking bank accounts and cards to compel individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This aims to create difficult living situations, encouraging compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Hunting and Trapping Tactics

Authorities will not "hunt for everyone" but will set traps in busy areas, such as train stations, large city metro stations, and potentially supermarkets in smaller cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. These locations could have police patrols and military enlistment office personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Reservists are advised to be cautious when traveling by plane or train, as these are places with high traffic where monitoring occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Those who receive a summons are especially at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

### Conscripts and Contract Service

There is an expectation that [[mobilization_laws_and_categories_of_conscription|conscripts]] might be sent to military service or forced to sign contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Under new amendments, individuals can be taken into contract service almost from the first moment of military service, a change from the previous requirement of three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Individuals are advised not to sign anything under duress and to contact lawyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Student Deferments

Students are also a concern regarding [[mobilization_laws_and_categories_of_conscription|mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. While full-time and part-time students generally have the right to deferment, graduates (bachelors and masters) are in a risk group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Those who completed a bachelor's degree this year should seek a master's program or an enterprise that provides a reservation to avoid conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Deferments sometimes are ignored in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

### Categories of Reservists Needed

Among reservists, car drivers, armored vehicle drivers, and grenade launchers are particularly needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

## [[martial_law_and_civil_liberties_restrictions|Martial Law]] Considerations

In the event of [[martial_law_and_civil_liberties_restrictions|martial law]], it is most likely that restrictions on leaving the country would apply only to those in the database of individuals potentially subject to [[mobilization_laws_and_categories_of_conscription|mobilization]], which currently numbers around 15 million but is expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Other categories, such as women, pensioners, and children, would likely still be able to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

[[martial_law_and_civil_liberties_restrictions|Martial law]] also includes a ban on movement between regions for Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that while [[martial_law_and_civil_liberties_restrictions|martial law]] is not necessarily imminent, this ban is a provision under it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Advice for Individuals

To protect against [[restrictive_measures_for_russian_military_draft_dodgers|restrictions]], it is advised to save personal money in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. For those living abroad, there is no point in communicating with Russian authorities or reporting information to military enlistment offices by proxy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. Individuals should prepare for the worst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.# Legal Restrictions Related to Military Service in Russia

## Potential Mobilization and Restrictions

Questions frequently concern the continuation of "partial mobilization" and potential [[restrictive_measures_for_russian_military_draft_dodgers|restrictions]] on citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

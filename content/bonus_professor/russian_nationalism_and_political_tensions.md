On March 6, 2023, discussions centered on the implications of recent events for [[russian_internal_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Russian internal political dynamics]] and the growing [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | political tensions]] within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. A significant focus was placed on the Bryansk region incident and its aftermath, and the looming [[potential_political_crisis_in_russia | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

## Bryansk Region Incident and its Aftermath

An incident in the Bryansk region was identified as a raid by a group calling themselves the "Russian volunteer corps," which is described as an organization whose existence is not widely known outside of this event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The purpose of the raid was to "show the flag" and demonstrate its existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Initial information surrounding the raid was contradictory, leading to various theories, including speculation that it was a "cunningly conceived needle" of the Russian Federation or an FSB operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. However, analysis concluded that it was a symbolic political, rather than military, act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

The contradictory information even led to the postponement of a Security Council meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. The political significance of the event lies in demonstrating that the armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine could be transferred to Russian territory by [[russian_internal_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Russian volunteers]] fighting on Ukraine's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Despite this, it's considered unlikely that the event will gain support from the broad Russian public, especially given the killing of people and shelling of civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. The Security Council was not significantly frightened by the raid itself, but rather by the very fact of [[russian_internal_political_dynamics_and_leadership_issues | Russian nationalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Purge of Russian Nationalists

Experts believe this incident will serve as a pretext to begin a purge of Russian nationalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. While no formal nationalist organizations exist in Russia (only a subculture and informal groups), this purge is not primarily due to fears of nationalists siding with Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Instead, it is linked to the [[potential_political_crisis_in_russia | serious political crisis]] expected after the armed confrontation with Ukraine concludes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Security officers, anticipating this crisis, are beginning to protect themselves from potential participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Russian nationalists have historically been feared, even though they haven't been a significant political or paramilitary force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

The events in Bryansk highlighted the vulnerability of border regions' populations to sabotage groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. However, the Russian leadership is reportedly not concerned about protecting these territories, leaving it to governors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. President Putin's primary concern remains his own security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Internal Discontent and Leadership Perceptions

The Security Council meeting on February 28, dedicated to the FSB, brought significant expectations for personnel changes within the FSB and other law enforcement agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. However, no changes occurred, as the president decided "not to change horses during the crossing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Replacing the head of the FSB, Bortnikov, after the Bryansk incident would imply holding him responsible, which Putin is not doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

Within the FSB, there is strong irritation towards the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. They reportedly characterize him as "impotent," believing he has made dramatic and tragic mistakes that have led Russia into a "dead end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. There is a sentiment that Russia needs to "get out of this crisis at the expense of this person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

## Economic Indicators and Future Crisis

Despite reports from Bloomberg indicating that Russian imports returned to 2020 levels and exports restored to pre-war levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, other economic indicators suggest underlying issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. Retail sales in Russia have been declining for ten consecutive months, falling by 10.5% in real terms by the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. This indicates that the population is becoming poorer, and those with savings are holding onto their money, preparing for worse conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

The prevailing public behavior suggests that an [[russian_internal_politics_and_economy | economic crisis]] is almost inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>. The enormous cost of the "special military operation," estimated by Bloomberg at $300 to $400 million per day, further exacerbates the economic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. This spending is seen as "against people" and "against Ukrainians and against Russians," leading to the destruction of cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>.

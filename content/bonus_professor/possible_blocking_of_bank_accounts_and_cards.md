During the 16th episode of his program, Valery Solovey addressed various questions submitted by viewers. Among the most frequently asked questions concerned the possible blocking of bank accounts and bank cards, particularly in relation to the upcoming second round of partial mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Origin of Concerns

The question about blocking bank accounts and cards arose despite such a restriction not being explicitly stated in the amendments to the law on the creation of a single register of military personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The current law outlines other types of restrictions, such as:
*   A ban on traveling to the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   A ban on real estate transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   A ban on registering an individual entrepreneur, potentially extending to general activities within the framework of an individual entrepreneur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   A ban on driving a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

However, these existing restrictions might not be effective enough to compel compliance, as many people do not possess foreign passports (only about 20% of the population) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, do not own a car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, or are not individual entrepreneurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Furthermore, there is currently no criminal punishment for evading mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## The Most Effective Measure

The speaker suggests that the easiest and most effective way to compel people to report to military registration and enlistment offices would be to block their bank accounts and cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, which is why this measure was not included in the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Accounts would likely be unblocked only after individuals come to the military registration and enlistment office and begin fulfilling their "sacred patriotic duty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Readiness of the Banking System

Contrary to some opinions that such a measure would cause a severe crisis in the banking system, the speaker asserts that the banking system is prepared for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Reportedly, Nabiullina (head of the Central Bank of Russia) has been preparing for the [[freezing_of_deposits_and_financial_challenges | blocking of accounts]] and cards since September of the previous year, acting on presidential instructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. It is suggested that this may not apply to everyone, but rather to those who receive electronic summonses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Protecting Against Financial Restrictions

For those concerned about potential [[freezing_of_deposits_and_financial_measures | financial restrictions]], the speaker advises to:
*   Save personal money in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
*   Be prepared to "spin" and adapt to difficult circumstances, as authorities are not interested in individual financial well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   "Get ready for the worst" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

This advice is rooted in many years of experience living in both the Soviet Union and the Russian Federation, where preparing for the best while expecting the worst has often been necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

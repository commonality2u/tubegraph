The withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson marked a significant [[historical_and_current_political_implications_in_russia | strategic turning point]] in the conflict, consolidating the strategic initiative in favor of Ukraine, which began around August-September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:12"></a>. While not a military catastrophe, the loss of Kherson is considered a "moral, psychological, and [[potential_political_crisis_in_russia | political catastrophe]]" for the [[potential_political_consequences_for_putin_and_russian_establishment | Russian leadership]] and the [[potential_political_consequences_for_putin_and_russian_establishment | Russian establishment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:12"></a>.

## Loss of Faith and Trust
A primary implication of the Kherson withdrawal is the final loss of faith in victory within the [[potential_political_consequences_for_putin_and_russian_establishment | Russian establishment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:04"></a>. Previously, the establishment believed that while they could no longer win, defeat was unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:22"></a>. Now, they must "get used to the idea of the inevitability of military defeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:49"></a>.

Furthermore, [[potential_political_consequences_for_putin_and_russian_establishment | Putin]] is now viewed by the establishment as a "loser," specifically a "toxic loser," where "everything he touches... turns into a substance directly opposite to gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00"></a>.

## Consequences of the Catastrophe
The [[potential_political_crisis_in_russia | moral and political catastrophe]] has several observable consequences:
*   **Confusion in Propaganda**: The propaganda machine and [[political_dynamics_and_potential_leadership_change_in_russia | political headquarters]] are at a loss for what to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:13"></a>. This confusion is expected to be overcome by tightened censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:10"></a>.
*   **Search for an Exit**: There is an intensified search for a way out of the impasse into which the Kremlin and [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | Russia]] were led <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:13"></a>.
*   **Recognition of Putin's Role**: [[potential_political_consequences_for_putin_and_russian_establishment | Putin]] is increasingly recognized as the main cause of the catastrophe, which is seen not only as moral and [[potential_political_crisis_in_russia | political]] but also partly global, with serious consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:04"></a>.
*   **Elite Discontent**: There is a noticeable increase in discontent among the elite, posing a fundamental threat to [[potential_political_consequences_for_putin_and_russian_establishment | Putin]]'s power and reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:08"></a>.

## Peace Proposals and Internal Dynamics
A peace proposal was received by the [[potential_political_consequences_for_putin_and_russian_establishment | Russian leadership]] immediately after the withdrawal from Kherson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:02"></a>. Key elements of these proposed global agreements include:
*   Russia's complete withdrawal from Ukraine, including DPR and LPR, but excluding Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:34"></a>.
*   Crimea receiving an indefinite status for seven years, with negotiations to follow, and Crimea being demilitarized with the Black Sea Fleet leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:12"></a>.
*   A 100 km deep demilitarized zone along the borders of Russia and Belarus with Ukraine, with heavy weapons removed from Russia and Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:15"></a>.
*   Ukraine promising not to join NATO for seven years and not to raise questions about joining NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:07"></a>.
*   The Russian military base in Transnistria to be moved to Russia, with Russia not interfering with Transnistria's integration into Moldova in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:01"></a>.
*   Russian military, political, and civilian personnel being guaranteed freedom, security, and the preservation of at least some assets, without being subject to punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:27"></a>. However, "scapegoats will be punished," while decision-makers are given "indulgences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:21"></a>. Financial compensation for Ukraine's damage was not mentioned in the received materials but should be discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:12"></a>.

Indirect signs suggest the [[potential_political_consequences_for_putin_and_russian_establishment | Russian leadership]] took these proposals seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:02"></a>:
*   The collapse of plans for tactical nuclear weapon use on Friday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:43"></a>.
*   Turkish President Erdogan's announcement of seeking to meet with [[potential_political_consequences_for_putin_and_russian_establishment | Putin]] soon to discuss peace with Ukraine, followed by a potential visit to Kyiv or call with Zelensky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:09"></a>.
*   A potential third sign would be if [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | Russia]] abandons the idea of another massive strike on Ukraine's energy infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:15"></a>.

These indications suggest the Kremlin is taking the proposals seriously, potentially to gain time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:02"></a>.

## Internal Responsibility and Future Outlook
The speaker emphasizes that [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | Russia]]'s public opinion does not influence the Kremlin unless it "imposes itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:47"></a>. The chance for public opinion to become a force exists if it unites and takes action to get rid of the "toxic asset" (referring to [[potential_political_consequences_for_putin_and_russian_establishment | Putin]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:07"></a>.

Regarding blame, the military will be blamed later, after a peace treaty is signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:49"></a>. Initially, "Turbo Patriots" who are now criticizing the authorities, like Strelkov and Dugin, will be blamed, repressed, intimidated, and punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:11"></a>. Censorship will also be tightened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:12"></a>. A "false [[political_dynamics_and_potential_leadership_change_in_russia | political target]]" or new [[political_dynamics_and_potential_leadership_change_in_russia | political party]] of "turbopatriots" might be created, with figures like Strelkov and Dugin potentially as its faces, to redirect discontent, possibly tied to early parliamentary elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:43"></a>.

Ukraine's military capabilities are critically dependent on American aid, and a decrease or cessation of this aid would reduce Ukraine's military effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:15"></a>. The American position is pragmatic: inflict a military defeat on [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | Russia]] on the battlefield, but without directly interfering to change [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | Russia's political system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:07"></a>. Any change in [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | Russia]]'s system or punishment of the guilty must be done by the citizens of [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | Russia]] themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:58"></a>. The speaker believes Russians will be able to achieve change, but it will come at a high cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:02"></a>. The nation is responsible for its actions and misdeeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:05"></a>.

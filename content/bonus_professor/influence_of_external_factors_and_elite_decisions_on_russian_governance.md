From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Russian politics is influenced by the decisions and [[power_struggles_within_russian_elite_groups | power struggles within elite groups]], as well as the impact of external circumstances and actors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Internal Political Dynamics and Elite Power

The [[internal_political_dynamics_and_power_transition_in_russia | internal political dynamics]] within Russia are heavily shaped by competing elite factions. These [[power_struggles_within_russian_elite_groups | elite coalitions]] exert visible influence on public affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Conflict Among Elite Coalitions
An example of this [[power_struggles_within_russian_elite_groups | struggle of elite coalitions]] was observed in a public dialogue between the Russian president's double (Evgeny Vasilyevich) and Denis Manturov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The reprimand directed at Manturov regarding waste incineration plants was initiated by the Patrushev group, which holds influence with the presidential security service that supervises the double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Manturov, however, answered worthily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Different "Kremlin towers" (elite groups) hold varying views on significant policy matters:
*   **Military Actions**: The Kremlin towers desire to end military actions with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. However, the "power or Chekist" tower prefers to conclude on more militant terms than the "pragmatist and realists" tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Plans for a peace agreement or truce with Ukraine remain in force, though their implementation terms can shift due to circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
*   **Chemezov's Group Influence**: Chemezov's group has successfully prevented a new wave of mobilization and the use of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. They have also blocked many other "extremely dangerous things" that the public might not be aware of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. For instance, in March-April 2022, several courageous individuals, at the cost of their careers, blocked the practical implementation of using tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### Political Leadership and Public Opinion
When considering potential leadership changes, public opinion is often disregarded in Russia. For instance, questions about Manturov's suitability for president are met with the assertion that public opinion has not been a factor in leadership for the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. Actual support for Putin is claimed not to have exceeded a third in recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>.

### Relationship with Key Figures
Ramzan Kadyrov's behavior towards other figures like Bastrykin and Kolokoltsev (critical remarks) versus Mishustin (politeness) is explained by his poor relations with Russian security forces, except for Zolotov, and excellent relations with Mishustin, who provides extensive support to Chechnya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>.

## External Influences on Russian Politics
External factors and [[international_perspectives_on_russian_politics | international perspectives]] significantly impact [[russian_political_situation_and_governance_issues | Russian political decisions]].

*   **US Administration and Truce**: The American side, specifically a new or incoming US administration (e.g., President Trump), sends signals to Russia that it will not tolerate delays in reaching a truce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. They are prepared to use blackmail to force Russia to conclude a truce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
*   **Trump's Plans for Mariupol**: The plans of elected President Trump are considered crucial for the fate of Mariupol, suggesting the Russian elite will have to adhere to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:09">[00:42:09]</a>.

## Governmental Plans and Their Implementation

Government plans and intentions are often subject to unforeseen circumstances, which can cause delays or modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. These "variables" can appear unexpectedly, interfering with plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

>[!INFO] On Predictability
>Plans are frequently postponed or modified due to unforeseen circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Only specific, well-known plans have absolute certainty, such as the 2022 military action against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> or the implementation of mass fertility tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Predicting outcomes in conditions of colossal uncertainty relies on probability, and even high probabilities only materialize in three out of four cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

Some decisions are purposefully exposed to prevent their implementation. For example, leaking information about the possible appointment of Viktor Khmari as acting Prime Minister helped block those plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

### Economic Policies
*   **Inflation**: Contrary to official statements, accumulated inflation over three years (from 2012 to end of 2015) is estimated to be no less than 90%, rather than the officially stated 28-29% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. Price growth is expected to accelerate, potentially reaching dollar exchange rates of 150-200 rubles next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Currency**: Old dollars are not accepted in certain places like Emirates or Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. It is advised to buy new dollars or euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.
*   **Imported Components**: Imported components are significant in almost all spheres despite claims of import substitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.
*   **Deposit Freezing**: The idea of freezing deposits has been postponed until spring/summer, but circumstances could lead to earlier implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>. There are competing projects for freezing deposits, with no common view yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>. The general public might not oppose such a measure, especially if smaller deposits are untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency**: Russian authorities are not preparing to arrest or confiscate cryptocurrency as they widely use it themselves to circumvent sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>. All transactions over $20 are recorded under the control of the FSB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:30">[00:48:30]</a>.
*   **Retirement Age**: After a change in power, the issue of returning to the previous retirement age and compensating those who did not receive their pension will be considered and likely implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

### Social Reforms
*   **Judicial System**: The judicial system will be reformed with complete lustration (purging) of the judiciary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.
*   **Education and Healthcare**: Extensive and comprehensive actions will be taken to reform education and healthcare systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>. While full changes may take 10-15 years, initial improvements will be felt in the first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.
*   **Travel Bans**: A significant portion of travel bans imposed by bailiff services will be lifted due to tax and other amnesties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>.
*   **Yarovaya Package**: The Yarovaya package (internet traffic storage) will be cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.
*   **Truth from the Media**: It is expected that next year, the truth will be told from "all the boxes," which will be a shock for many after 30 years of lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.

## Prospects for [[Future leadership and governance in Russia | Future Leadership]]

The year 2025 is predicted to be harder for Russia than the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. However, there is hope for 2026 to be easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

### Potential for Positive Change
There is a possibility that a change in power in Russia could lead to a government working for the good of society, rather than solely for personal interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>. This confidence is based on knowing the people involved and their commitment to building a control system that prevents self-enrichment at society's expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>. Such individuals, who prioritized noble paths over colossal wealth, exist in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.

There are enough honest people who desire career advancement aligned with ideal goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>. A democratic system of checks and balances, for which a concept is ready, will minimize risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:18">[00:47:18]</a>.

### Return to the Civilized World
A "return of Russia to the civilized world" means shedding illusions and removing corrupt leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>. This civilized world is defined by:
*   Absence of moral and psychological manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:53">[00:39:53]</a>.
*   Respect for personal freedoms (privacy, work, business) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.
*   No encouragement for mass murder under the guise of patriotism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.
*   Respect for women and valuing animals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:13">[00:40:13]</a>.
*   Good infrastructure (roads) and, crucially, a good attitude towards people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>.
*   Adequate social security, comparable to Central European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>.
*   A normal, decent, peaceful human life, free from constant violence against its own people and attempts to project violence globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:48">[00:40:48]</a>.

This transition depends on Russia's willingness to abandon its self-deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.

### Post-Transition Actions
*   **Treatment of Former Officials**: Individuals who broke the law (e.g., poisoning people with food, selling dangerous medicine) will be held accountable according to the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.
*   **Asat and Yanukovych**: Figures like Asat and Yanukovych will be transferred to their respective countries for legal proceedings, although the Russian side will not hand over its own citizens to international courts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>. Asat paid $132 billion of his country's foreign exchange reserves for political asylum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. Yanukovych also paid billions of dollars, with part of his funds financing Russian military operations in Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>.
*   **Toll Roads and Clinics**: Toll roads and clinics will remain, but a free, high-quality alternative must always be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>.
*   **Combating Fraud**: The fight against fraudulent schemes will be strengthened, with a 100% chance of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. Experts believe mass telephone calls can be stopped within six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:11">[00:45:11]</a>, as the protectors of these schemes are known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:01">[00:45:01]</a>.
*   **Bookmakers**: Bookmaking offices will survive any financial changes, as they are "racketeers" and bring in colossal profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:52">[00:49:52]</a>.
*   **Prigozhin**: Evgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin is alive and well, known in the West, and visits Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>. He will appear on stage when he deems it desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.
*   **Public Awareness**: The truth about what happened in Russia and what was done by the [[role_and_influence_of_key_Russian_political_figures_and_coalitions | Russian elite]] and leadership will be communicated and made available to everyone with evidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. However, a significant part of society may not believe it due to fear of thinking and the truth destroying their world view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

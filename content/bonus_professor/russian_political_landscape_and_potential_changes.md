## Current Military Operation and Peace Discussions

The ongoing special military operation has reached 100 days, with no "breakthrough" in sight for either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. Official instructions have been given to not emphasize the duration of the operation, indicating it is not a blitzkrieg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:44">[02:42:44]</a>.

Signs suggest the operation is not proceeding as planned:
*   **Leadership Changes** The commander appointed in early April, Dvornikov, reportedly disappeared from sight, with Colonel General Gennady Zhidko now assumed to be leading the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Such frequent changes in military command suggest that things are not going according to plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:25">[03:34:25]</a>. This signals shifts within [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | Russian political dynamics and power struggles]].
*   **Nuclear Strike De-escalation** The Russian President is reportedly in an underground bomb shelter, which suggests the idea of tactical nuclear strikes on Ukraine is currently "off the agenda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.

Amidst the conflict, Western countries like the United States, Great Britain, and the European Union are holding consultations on a "peace formula" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Notably, these discussions have occurred without Ukraine's participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. The proposed Italian formula suggests Ukraine as a neutral, non-aligned state, full autonomy for Crimea and Donbas, and Russian troop withdrawal to their February 24 positions, followed by large-scale negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

However, this formula is unlikely to satisfy either Russia or Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>:
*   **Russia's Position** Russia controls significant parts of Kherson, Luhansk, Donetsk, and Zaporozhye regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Steps are being taken to integrate these territories into the Russian Federation, including issuing Russian passports, introducing Russian mobile operators, and adopting the ruble as an official currency in the Kherson region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. It is difficult to imagine Russia agreeing to leave these "new territories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
*   **Ukraine's Position** Ukraine would likely not accept such conditions after the sacrifices it has made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. However, it could be "forced" to agree by a cessation of essential Western weapon supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. "Old Europe" (Germany, France, Italy) may favor this approach, while Great Britain, Poland, the Baltic countries, and the United States currently resist it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

## Economic Sustainability Under Sanctions

The European Union's 6th package of sanctions includes measures against Russian oil and oil products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. In 2021, EU countries imported nearly 71 billion euros worth of Russian oil and oil products, and the sanctions aim to reduce this by approximately 65 billion euros by the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

Despite these figures, the immediate impact on the [[russian_economy | Russian economy]] may not be "ominous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>:
*   **Reorientation of Exports** Russia can reorient up to 40% of its oil exports from Europe to China and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>.
*   **Circumventing Measures** Even restrictions on supplying Russian oil to third countries or refusal to insure tankers can be bypassed, for example, by mixing Russian oil with other oil so it is no longer "formally Russian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. High oil prices also mitigate losses from selling at a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:17]</a>.

However, personal sanctions against the Russian elite, their spouses, and children are highly irritating as they restrict travel and access to assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. While this irritation is significant, it is not expected to lead to a conspiracy or riot against Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

## Unspoken Concerns About the Economy and August

While expert estimates suggest sanctions may not be "deadly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>, individuals integrated into the real economy (officials, businessmen) report serious concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. They view August as a "fatal month," fearing a financial crisis or a powerful cyberattack on the Russian banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:07]</a>. Though they cannot verbalize the exact nature or source of these problems, they share an "unpleasant feeling" that the end of summer could be "extremely alarming and even unpleasant" in financial and economic terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>. This indicates underlying [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian sociopolitical dynamics]] and a sense of unease.

## Looming Changes in Russian Leadership

There is a growing sentiment among [[russian_domestic_political_situation | Moscow officials and the highest echelon of the federal bureaucracy]] that Putin "will have to leave" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>. This belief is leading to:
*   **Disorganization of the Administrative Apparatus** Officials are less willing to take risks, leading to noticeable disorganization, reminiscent of the Soviet Union's collapse in 1990-1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.
*   **"Last Grab" Mentality** As the transitional moment approaches, some officials may be focused on "exclusively their own personal and group tasks," possibly engaging in a "last grab" of resources before potential changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>. This highlights [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | internal political dynamics and power struggles]].
*   **Concealment Efforts** To hide the true situation, the use of doubles, augmented reality for video messages, and pre-recorded meetings (canned food) is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>.

### The Future Without Putin

If Putin departs, "almost everything" will change, though not immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>. The system, which relies on Putin as its core, will begin to fall apart, likely within years, not decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:00:00">[17:00:00]</a>.

> "without Putin the Putin system is impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>

The State Council, which Putin is currently staffing, is described as a "terrarium of like-minded people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>. While Putin could reconcile and maintain stability among these individuals, it is highly doubtful that the system will remain unified or functional without him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>.

The future of liberties and freedoms will depend on the actions of the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:14:00">[18:14:00]</a>. Even scheduled elections in September may be cancelled at the last minute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>. The summer of 2022 is anticipated to lead to a "very interesting outcome," potentially dramatic and exciting, in [[potential_changes_in_russian_leadership_and_implications | Russian political dynamics amidst leadership changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>.

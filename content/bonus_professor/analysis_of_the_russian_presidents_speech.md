This article analyzes a speech delivered by [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | the Russian President]] to the Council on Human Rights and Civil Society Development on December 7th, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. The analysis is based on comments made by Valery Solovyov on his YouTube channel, episode 42 of "What's Happening," recorded on December 8th, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Solovyov notes that this speech perfectly characterizes [[Assessment of Vladimir Putins presidency and its impact | the mental state and style of the Russian president]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Context of the Speech

The Council on Human Rights is described as a "specially selected body" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, with "troublemakers" removed in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. The questions posed to [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | the President]] were preliminarily approved by the administration and personally approved by him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, ensuring no "uncomfortable and disturbing" topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

Solovyov summarizes [[President Putins address to Russians | Putin's speech]] with the phrase: "What do you want from a sick mind?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>, implying the "sick person" is not a metaphor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. He warns of a "huge distance" between [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | the President's]] words and actions, a gap that is constantly increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Key Points and Analysis

### International Doctrine of Human Rights

[[President Putins address to Russians | Putin stated]] that the international doctrine of human rights is "used to destroy the sovereignty of states" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

> Solovyov questions this, noting that human rights encompass free elections, separation of powers, freedom of movement, and inviolability of personal property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. He argues that these freedoms only threaten a state "the basis of which is the power of criminals, thieves, and bandits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>, as human rights directly challenge and destroy such a state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

### Donbass and "National Interests"

[[President Putins address to Russians | Putin claimed]] that the rights of Donbass residents are violated, and Ukraine considers Russia a "second-class country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. He asserted that Russia's only answer can be a "consistent struggle for their national interests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

> Solovyov challenges the idea of "national interests" in the context of defending a country where 25% of toilets are outdoors, huge territories are "emptying and dying," and pensioners live on "tiny pensions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. He points out that the "special military operation" has only accelerated this decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. Regarding Donbass, he states that at least 1.5 to 2 million people have left since 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.
>
> Solovyov also questions why [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin]], as Supreme Commander-in-Chief, did not start an operation to protect Donbass residents in 2014-2015 when chances of military success were "disproportionately higher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. He highlights a "logical inconsistency" where human rights allegedly undermine Russia's sovereignty, but the rights of Donbass residents should undermine Ukraine's sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

### Origin of the War

[[President Putins address to Russians | Putin reiterated]] the common propaganda line that the war was "not started by us" but by the Ukrainian authorities after the 2014 coup d'Ã©tat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

> Solovyov directly refutes this by citing Igor Strelkov-Girkin, an "icebreaker" of the "Russian world," who "said and repeated it many times, 'the war in Donbass began, I'" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. Solovyov states he trusts Girkin's words on this matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>.

### Poland's Alleged Intentions

[[President Putins address to Russians | Putin claimed]] that "a nationalist group in Poland" desires to "take the western territories of Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.

> Solovyov dismisses this as statements from "marginal groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>, comparing them to Russian State Duma deputies who demand Alaska's return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. He points out that Poland has been a major sponsor of Ukraine, providing military and humanitarian aid, and accepting the most Ukrainian refugees, with no public or state figures expressing territorial claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.
>
> Solovyov then ironically notes that Russia, according to [[President Putins address to Russians | Putin]], is "the only guarantor of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>, despite having launched a "special military operation" that resulted in Ukrainian territories being included in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. He draws a parallel to Russia's guarantee of Ukraine's security via the Budapest Memorandum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.

### Protection of Russian Rights

[[President Putins address to Russians | Putin suggested]] that Russia needs to protect the rights of Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:15:00">[12:15:00]</a>.

> Solovyov immediately counters with the issue of the "rights of the mobilized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. He questions why the President is "surprised that in some places there are still problems with the equipment of the mobilized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>, sarcastically suggesting "enemies have penetrated the device" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. He also highlights the President's promises to address rehabilitation for the wounded, modern prosthetics, and drug provision, noting that these issues are only being discussed "more than 9 months" after the special military operation began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.

### Nuclear Weapons Doctrine

[[President Putins address to Russians | Putin stated]] that [[exercises_and_potential_implications_for_russian_leadership | Russia's nuclear weapons]] are considered "only as a means of protection" and only if "we have nothing else left" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:36:00">[14:36:00]</a>. He added that if Russia does not use them first, it will have "no chance at all to survive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:29:00">[15:29:00]</a>.

> Solovyov interprets this as a recognition of Russia's ability to deliver a "first nuclear strike" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:59:00">[14:59:00]</a>, calling it a "very dangerous statement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>.

### Mobilization

[[President Putins address to Russians | Putin claimed]] that "the conversation about additional mobilization does not make sense" at the present time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>.

> Solovyov asserts that this is untrue, stating that preparations are underway for "additional recruitment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>, with agendas prepared and military commissars awaiting the "go-ahead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>. He warns that a full mobilization of "millions of people" could be declared if the concept of a "people's war" suggested by Sergei Kiriyenko is adopted, implying martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>. Solovyov reminds listeners of [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin's]] past broken promises, such as "as long as I am alive there will be no pension reform" and "we will not rewrite the Constitution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>. He urges people not to be deceived by words but to look at actions, which "directly, frankly, unequivocally contradict" [[President Putins address to Russians | what the President said]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>. He also points out that the President has not signed a decree ending partial mobilization, which indicates further plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>.

### Duration of "Special Military Operation"

[[President Putins address to Russians | Putin stated]] that the special military operation is "designed to last a long time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.

> Solovyov contrasts this with the claim of no need for mobilization, arguing that a long operation will require human resources and rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>. He notes that the operation "absorbs a quarter of the budget of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:33:00">[19:33:00]</a>, meaning funds for "new hospitals, pension increases, social payments, maternity capital increases" are diverted to "guns, shells, artillery shots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:41:00">[19:41:00]</a>. He highlights that 1.5 million sets of uniforms have "disappeared" and that "300 billion Russian reserves dollars in Europe" turned out to be less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>, suggesting they were stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34:00">[20:34:00]</a>.

### "Achievements" of the Special Military Operation

[[President Putins address to Russians | Putin cited]] the Sea of Azov being turned into an "inland sea of Russia" as an achievement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>.

> Solovyov questions the value of acquiring more land for "the largest country in the world by area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:53:00">[20:53:00]</a>, which he describes as "unkempt" and "lying as if in ruins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>. He emphasizes that the authorities "do not care about our country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:17:00">[21:17:00]</a> and suggests focusing on internal issues like gasification for millions, providing water, and building toilets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:25:00">[21:25:00]</a>. He concludes that Russia should be proud of putting its own land in order, which would naturally attract other countries, rather than exporting violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:00]</a>.

### Healthcare Payments

[[President Putins address to Russians | Putin promised]] additional payments for primary care doctors starting January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>.

> Solovyov expresses skepticism, noting that it is "supposed to mobilize 300 thousand women in the second stage," mostly doctors and medical personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>. This means the remaining doctors will "work for two, for three," making any increase "very, very insignificant" compared to the increased workload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:53:00">[22:53:00]</a>.

## Overall Assessment of the President's Mental State

Solovyov concludes that [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | the President]] "still believes in all this himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>, ignoring all inconsistencies and illogicalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:40:00">[23:40:00]</a>.

> This type of thinking is categorized as "medicine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:53:00">[23:53:00]</a>, echoing the earlier quote, "What do you want from a sick consciousness?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03:00">[24:03:00]</a>. Solovyov laments that "this man runs Russia" in a "strange, bizarre way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:08:00">[24:08:00]</a>, which is a "grief and misfortune for us" and for Russia's neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:00">[24:23:00]</a>.

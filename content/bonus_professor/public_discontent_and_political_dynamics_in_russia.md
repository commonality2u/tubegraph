Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, in episode 42 of the program "What's Happening," recorded on Sunday, December 11 and released on Monday, December 12, discusses various aspects of [[the_internal_political_and_social_atmosphere_in_russia | Russia's internal political and social atmosphere]] and its challenges [00:00:30]. The episode covers topics such as negative economic and employment growth, how Vladimir Putin "saves the people," the "fog of war" clearing minds, and the government's strategy of "sitting on bayonets" [00:00:48].

## Analysis of Vladimir Putin's Statements

Recent public speeches by Russian President Vladimir Putin contained internal contradictions, reflecting a "pathologically sick consciousness" [00:03:59].

### "Everything is Going According to Plan"
Putin's assertion that "everything is going according to plan" is questioned due to the lack of public knowledge regarding this plan. Any negative outcome could be labeled "planned" if the plan itself is unknown [00:04:13].

### No Mobilization
Despite Putin's repeated public assurances that there will be no mobilization, this statement is met with skepticism [00:04:39]. The speaker highlights Putin's past unfulfilled promises, such as not raising the retirement age, not running for a third term, and improving Russia's economic standing to match Portugal or Slovakia [00:05:10]. The possibility of a future need for new recruits due to ongoing events is raised [00:05:03].

### Nuclear Weapons
Putin's comments on nuclear weapons also contain contradictions [00:05:33]. While stating Russia does not intend to use them first, he implied that not using them first would eliminate the chance to use them at all [00:05:38]. This has led to discussions about a preventive strike concept, which the United States has, versus Russia's concept of a response to a counterstrike [00:05:44]. These statements were perceived in the West as a readiness by the Russian president to use nuclear weapons [00:06:01].

## Economic Situation

Despite "bravura statements" about Russia's nuclear shield, economic forecasts are becoming gloomier [00:06:15]. Unofficial forecasts, particularly from Alfa Bank and its economist Natalia Orlova, predict a significant economic downturn [00:06:38].

*   **GDP Decline**: Alfa Bank forecasts Russia's GDP will decrease by 6.5% in 2023 [00:06:49]. This contrasts sharply with the Central Bank's forecast of a 2.0-2.1% fall and the Ministry of Economic Development's projection of less than 1% [00:06:58]. If Alfa Bank's forecast proves true, it would be the largest GDP decline in Russia since 2009 [00:07:08].
*   **Nature of Crisis**: Highly qualified economists suggest the current crisis has a different nature, implying a slow recovery [00:07:36]. Key factors include decreased domestic demand, export restrictions, and a decline in investment [00:07:48].
*   **Employment**: There's a "negative increase in employment" [00:08:03]. By early summer, 13% (4.3 million) of Russia's working-age population were on unpaid, partially paid leave, or idle [00:08:11]. This trend in unemployment is considered dangerous [00:08:45].

## Demographic Decline and Elite's Vision

Alexander Solzhenitsyn's 1990 treatise, "How to Organize Russia," stated that the main task of the authorities should be to save the people [00:08:52]. However, the current situation shows a contrasting trend [00:09:03].

*   **Falling Birth Rate**: In October 2022, the birth rate in Russia fell by 11% compared to the previous year [00:09:23].
*   **Population Decrease**: The population has decreased by half a million people since the beginning of the year [00:09:33].
*   **Elite's Ideal**: The speaker suggests that the current direction aims to transform Russia into a land with a ruling "elite" and 25-30 million "servants," with the population degrading both socially and anthropologically [00:09:51].

## Shifting Public Mood

Even so-called "Turbo Patriots" (those who consume military Telegram channels and TV propaganda) are experiencing a shift in mood [00:11:03].

*   **Focus Group Findings**: Materials from two focus groups, reportedly ordered by the Kremlin and conducted by the "Dossier Center," reveal this shift [00:10:44].
    *   The first study was in July 2022, when Russian troops were advancing through heavy battles [00:11:11].
    *   The second study was in November, after a series of defeats, including the loss of Kherson [00:11:25].
*   **Growing Disappointment**: The mood has changed significantly, with "Turbo Patriots" now disappointed in the army and Putin [00:11:38]. Many are reportedly ready to sacrifice new territories for peace, seeing no sense in them, indicating that the "fog of war" is clearing [00:11:48].
*   **Worsening Situation for Authorities**: This suggests that the situation in the country is changing for the worse for the authorities [00:12:30]. Putin's popularity is at record lows, and [[social_unrest_and_public_dissatisfaction_in_russia | public dissatisfaction]] is increasing [00:12:43]. This is a reason Putin continues to promise no mobilization to avoid disturbing people, who are clearly under stress and expect "dirty tricks" from the government [00:12:51].

## Government Response to Discontent

The Russian government's strategy to cope with growing discontent involves increasing reliance on force [00:13:24].

*   **Budget Allocation**: The federal budget for 2023-2025, signed by Putin, reflects this [00:13:31]. It projects a 5% decrease in overall tax collection and a 24% decrease in oil and gas budget revenues [00:13:36]. Simultaneously, it includes a sharp reduction in economic support spending and a "record jump" in financing "unarmed forces" â€“ the police, National Guard, FSB, and Federal Protective Service [00:13:46].
*   **"Sitting on Bayonets"**: Every third ruble will go to security forces, and a quarter of the budget is classified [00:14:04]. This approach is described as "sitting on bayonets," a strategy that is unsustainable in the long term [00:14:20].
*   **Judicial Control**: The government's control extends to the judiciary, as exemplified by the sentencing of Ilya Yashin [00:14:52]. High-profile negotiations, including sentencing terms, are discussed and confirmed by the president, indicating that the courts are not independent despite Putin's claims [00:15:16].

## Behavior of the Russian Establishment

The behavior of the Russian establishment and officials, particularly those forming the backbone of Russian power, is changing [00:15:59].

*   **Increased Alcohol and Substance Use**: "Very interesting everyday sketches" suggest that breakfast in political institutions now begins with alcohol, followed by more alcohol at lunch, supplemented with "a certain specific amplifier of mental processes" (implied to be drugs) to provide "freedom, energy," and a means to "forget about the terrible present" and "even more terrible prospects." Evenings involve a "cocktail" [00:16:10].
*   **Putin's Dissatisfaction**: President Putin is reportedly very dissatisfied with this increase in drinking among officials at both federal and regional levels [00:16:58]. He himself is described as having a very moderate attitude towards alcohol [00:17:10]. This increased consumption is seen as a coping mechanism for stress [00:17:42].
*   **Seeking a "Second Homeland"**: Rumors suggest that Russian officials are actively seeking a "second homeland" where they can "lie low" after the regime collapses [00:18:08].
    *   **Latin America**: Latin America is not considered a safe option for top Russian elite due to the predominant influence of the United States [00:18:34]. Second and third echelon officials might get lost there without guarantees, but the American state machine could still reach them anywhere [00:18:53].
    *   **Africa**: Instead, Africa is being used in this capacity [00:19:22]. "Alternate airfields" have been created there, including luxury housing, reserves of currency and precious metals, and protection [00:19:42]. The Wagner Group's reputation was formed in Africa, where it operates successfully, and part of its forces remain there [00:19:58].

## Outlook on the Situation

The situation for Russian authorities appears largely hopeless [00:20:33]. They can no longer count on a military victory or broad public support, despite the concept of a "people's war" [00:20:36]. Furthermore, there is "nowhere to run" [00:20:49]. The speaker concludes that the authorities do not deserve pity [00:20:51]. This assessment underscores the ongoing [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | political crisis and instability in Russia]].

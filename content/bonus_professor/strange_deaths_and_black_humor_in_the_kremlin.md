The Kremlin is reportedly prone to "black humor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. An example of a popular joke circulated within the Kremlin was "who will die faster Nikita Mikhalkov or about the DKB" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, referring to the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

## Unexplained Deaths in the Defense Industry

A series of "strange deaths" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a> occurred over approximately three weeks, attracting significant attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>:

*   **Pavel Kamenev** The scientific director of Almaz Antey, developer of "infamous" Caliber missiles, died on January 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. He was 85 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   **Vladimir Nesterov** The general director of the Khrunichev center, who led the project to create heavy missiles, died on December 28 at the age of 73 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
*   **Alexander Buzakov** The general director of the Admiralty Shipyards and manufacturer of Caliber missiles, died four days before Nesterov, on December 24, 2022, at 66 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

These three deaths of individuals involved in defense industry design work "do not look like a coincidence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. This pattern is noted alongside other "suicides or strange deaths of SL employees last year" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>, information which is often hidden but still reaches the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.

## Speculation Regarding Doubles

Rumors suggest that an alleged trip by the Russian president to Ufa to say goodbye to the first Bashkir president, Murtaza Rakhimov, was actually made by one of his "doubles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. It is claimed that there are "22 doubles" of the president, with this particular one being the "first main double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. This individual reportedly "very successfully coped" with the role, even meeting with the current Bashkir president and giving interviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

This situation draws a parallel to Akira Kurosawa's film "Shadow of the Warrior" (Kagemusha), where a double replaces a killed feudal prince to conceal his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. The double becomes so immersed in the role that he begins to believe he is the prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. The film's story, which ends tragically for both the double and the principality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>, illustrates that the practice of using [[speculations_around_putin_and_doubles | doubles]] existed in medieval Japan and "a number of countries, not only in the modern Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.

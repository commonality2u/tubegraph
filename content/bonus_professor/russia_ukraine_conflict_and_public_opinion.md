This article explores various aspects of the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia-Ukraine conflict]], including its economic impact, [[political_unrest_and_geopolitical_tensions_in_russia_and_ukraine | political unrest]], and the evolving [[public_opinion_and_its_impact_on_russian_political_dynamics | public sentiment]] within Russia.

## Key Topics Discussed

The program addresses several key topics, including:
*   The question of President Putin's understanding of reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   The introduction of an oil price ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   Statements made by President Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
*   The fear of The Hague and the sentiment that "no one wanted to die" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Public Interest and Concerns

During a public lecture, the audience's questions primarily focused on the current situation rather than historical context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Key concerns included:
*   Questions of survival, particularly in connection with mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   The general economic prospects of Russia, which were described as "joyless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   The future of Russia after the conflict ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   The global context, occasionally with "subtle conspiracy tint" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
    *   A typical question was whether the [[ukraine_russia_conflict_analysis | confrontation]] was a trap for Russia set by the West, or part of a plan by "over the national global forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The speaker answered negatively to both scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Economic Reality Versus Official Statements

Despite President Putin's claims of "positive dynamics in reducing the poverty level in Russia" to 10.5% by the end of the third quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, the speaker asserts that this figure represents "Hellish poverty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   Only 23% of Russians are satisfied with their financial situation, according to a public opinion survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   The share of microcredit loans with overdue payments of more than three months has reached 43% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, indicating a struggle for many compatriots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   The Russian economy is expected to fall by at least 20% over the next 8-10 years, according to the Chief Economist of the U.S. State Department, Emily Blanchard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This means a "stable decline and degradation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   The speaker suggests that the Russian government and elite "live on another planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, detached from the reality of the Russian people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.

## Impact of Oil Price Ceiling

The introduction of a ceiling on oil prices by Canada, Australia, and the G7 for EU countries at $60 per barrel is not expected to be as dramatic as some predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   Russian oil (Urals crude) was already selling at $52 per barrel in Primorsk in the last week of November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, placing it below the ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   Russia's leadership has stated it will not supply oil to countries that adopt these restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>, despite 47% of all oil exports typically going to EU countries (with the exception of Hungary) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   There's an expectation that oil might be supplied through third countries or via transshipment at sea, delivered under foreign flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Russia has reportedly bought 100 tankers in the last month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   The EU is introducing a law with a five-year prison term for those who help Russia circumvent sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>, indicating anticipation of such efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   The Russian budget is expected to suffer losses, which may lead to the "printing press" being spun up and accelerated inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

## Diplomatic Stances and Propaganda

President Biden's statement about being ready to talk to Putin was quickly clarified by the U.S. State Department: discussions would only occur "after the complete withdrawal of Russian troops from Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. This led to a chorus of condemnatory words from Kremlin forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

Russian propagandists like Simonyan and Skabeeva have stated that if Russia "loses," everyone will end up in The Hague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.
*   The speaker views this as an attempt to invoke "collective responsibility" and to "probe the readiness of society for a people's war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
*   The speaker refutes this, stating that the responsibility for "every mistake, every crime, has a surname, first name, patronymic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.
*   Propagandists are warned they might face "domestic justice" before The Hague <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

## [[russian_societal_change_and_public_dissatisfaction | Shifting Public Sentiment]] Regarding the Conflict

Surveys indicate a significant shift in [[public_opinion_and_its_impact_on_russian_political_dynamics | public opinion]] concerning the [[russia_and_ukraine_conflict_dynamics | conflict]]:
*   According to closed surveys by the Federal Security Service (FSO), 55% of Russians are now in favor of [[discussion_on_russian__ukrainian_relations_and_conflict_resolution | peace negotiations with Ukraine]], while only 25% support the continuation of the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>.
*   The Levada Center, an independent sociological center, reported similar findings in October: 57% for peace negotiations and 27% for continued military action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.
*   Reasons for this shift in sentiment include:
    *   Reliable information about what is happening is becoming more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
    *   The "partial mobilization" significantly influenced people's attitudes, as the conflict moved from a distant event to something that "can come to every home" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.
    *   Fears are growing due to the anticipated "second stage of mobilization," which is expected to be "incomparably more extensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. This fear is justified as the Russian leadership has no other way to stop the Ukrainian pressure than to "throw bodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

## Outlook for the Future

The speaker states that 2022 was the hardest year for Russia in the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>. Unfortunately, the coming year is expected to be even harder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

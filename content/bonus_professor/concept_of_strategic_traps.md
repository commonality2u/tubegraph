From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Valery Solovey's program "What's Happening" delves into the concept of a [[strategic_deadend_in_russianukrainian_war | strategic trap]], particularly in the context of the [[strategic_situation_of_the_russian_federation | Russian Federation]] and its leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This term, while often used in military art, is also applicable in business and other fields where strategy is a key concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

> [!definition] Strategic Trap
> A strategic trap is characterized by two main features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>:
> 1.  The fundamental inability of one party in a conflict to achieve its military-political goals through military means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
> 2.  Despite this fundamental inability, the party continues to increase efforts to achieve these goals, which are often obviously unattainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## [[historical_examples_of_strategic_traps | Historical Examples of Strategic Traps]]

Several superpowers have fallen into [[historical_examples_of_strategic_traps | strategic traps]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>:
*   **United States:**
    *   In Vietnam (1965-1973) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
    *   In Afghanistan (2001-2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Soviet Union:**
    *   In Afghanistan (1979-1989) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Modern Russia:**
    *   Currently in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

These traps have historically been long in duration, ultimately ending with withdrawal and political defeat, not necessarily military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. In these situations, colossal resources were ineptly wasted to no avail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Reasons for Falling into Strategic Traps

Countries fall into strategic traps due to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>:
1.  **Overestimation of Own Power:** The first party to the conflict overestimates its own economic and military strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
2.  **Underestimation of Enemy Strength:** The second party underestimates the strength of the enemy, including not only military power but also the ability of civilians to sustain resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
3.  **Misunderstanding of Theater of Operations:** The party holding the initiative does not fully grasp the significance or specifics of the military operational theater (e.g., jungle terrain in Vietnam, mountainous terrain in Afghanistan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
4.  **Underestimation of Strategic Context:** An error in assessing the strategic context, such as the involvement of other superpowers providing aid to the enemy (e.g., Soviet Union and China aiding North Vietnam, the West aiding Afghanistan against the Soviets, or the West aiding Ukraine against Russia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Russian propaganda accurately notes Western involvement, primarily as a supplier of equipment, intelligence, and technology, with some Western PMCs actively involved on Ukraine's side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

## Reasons for Persisting in Strategic Traps

Even with predictions of danger, countries persist in strategic traps due to:

### Arrogance of Power
The hope that the difference in economic and military potential will eventually favor the side with greater potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This "arrogance of power" is characteristic not only of the United States (in Vietnam and Afghanistan) but also of the Soviet Union (in Afghanistan) and applies to the actions of the [[russias_military_strategy_and_internal_debates | Russian Federation]] in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

### Cognitive Delusion
A cognitive delusion, common in military-political leadership, involves constantly increasing stakes to achieve a result, similar to a casino player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Examples include Defense Secretary McNamara's proposals to increase American military presence in Vietnam and the Soviet Union's behavior in Afghanistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Russia's energy war against Ukraine is seen as a similar attempt to recoup losses and raise the stakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This behavior, known as "not wanting to fix losses," is typical for businesses that continue to invest in mediocre, losing projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### Distorting Properties of Religion or Ideology
While not typical for the US or Soviet Union (though ideology played a role), the obscuring properties of religion can lead to prolonged conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. The Iran-Iraq war, which lasted eight years with over 1.5 million casualties, is cited as an example, fueled by Iran's passionate ideology of the victorious Islamic revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

## Persistence and Political Systems

While everyone is subject to cognitive delusions, only countries with colossal economic and military potential, such as superpowers, can easily afford to persist in such delusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Economically developed but smaller countries, lacking such resource potential, are quickly forced to abandon conflicts and seek reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

Democratic systems generally have an advantage here because criticism and competition force leaders to react faster to resource depletion, as they risk losing elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This contributes to the observed pattern that regional conflicts over the past 200 years have averaged 3-4 to 16-18 months, indicating an inability to sustain resource overstrain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Authoritarian leaders, however, persist because losing or exiting on terms they perceive as dishonorable is fraught with the loss of their political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. There is no external "luring" into these traps; political and military leaderships willingly enter these situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. When they get deep into a trap and do not want to exit, opponents begin to wage a war of attrition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

## Russia's Current Situation

Unlike the Soviet Union, Russia is not a superpower in terms of resource potential, with its GDP share in the world being 1.7% compared to 23% for the US and 17% for the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This vast economic and military incomparability with supporting nations means Russia cannot talk about victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.

Russia had a chance for an "honorable withdrawal" in March of the previous year, when Ukrainian leadership was ready to make concessions, but this opportunity was "blown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Now, neither the Ukrainian leadership nor society will make concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

The situation for the [[kremlin_strategic_challenges_and_military_ambitions | Russian Federation]] and its leadership is expected to worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. To achieve an "honorable exit" that can be presented as a victory, Putin is ready to do anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:42">[00:18:42]</a>. He has two resources:
1.  **Nuclear tactical weapons** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
2.  **Manpower**: Believing Russia's human potential significantly exceeds Ukraine's, Putin is prepared to "throw the people into the furnace of confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. This highlights the [[consequences_and_strategies_for_individuals_during_mobilization | consequences and strategies for individuals during mobilization]] in such a context. He is willing to sacrifice his own people to preserve his power, considering losses of up to half a million people acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

The Ministry of Defense does not confirm or refute these estimates, preferring to report Ukrainian losses, which are statistically illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a>.

Ultimately, the goals of the "special operation" are now internal to Russia, with the main goal for Putin being the preservation of his own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. However, this pursuit paradoxically weakens his power daily, as those around him and Russian society understand that they are caught in a trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

Miyamoto Musashi, the Japanese swordsman and author of "The Book of Five Rings," is quoted: "Immature strategy is the reason for sadness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. This phrase accurately describes what has happened to Russia, the Kremlin, and Putin personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

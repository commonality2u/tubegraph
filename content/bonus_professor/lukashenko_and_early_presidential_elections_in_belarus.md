Following the presidential elections in [[protests_in_russia_and_belarus | Belarus]], which many European countries, including Ukraine, did not officially recognize, the political situation remains highly uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The ongoing protests in [[protests_in_russia_and_belarus | Belarus]] have evolved into what is described as a revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. However, this revolution appears to be reaching a dead end, as the impulse of Belarusians is deemed insufficient to decisively overthrow [[future_of_belarus_under_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Proposed Compromise and Russian Influence

A compromise solution is anticipated, with its formula having been discussed during telephone conversations between Russian President [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Putin]] and [[future_of_belarus_under_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The proposed compromise includes:
*   [[future_of_belarus_under_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] remaining president of [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] for no longer than one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   Announcement of early presidential elections after this period, coinciding with the adoption of a new constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   During this transitional period, [[future_of_belarus_under_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] must sign a new union treaty with [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   [[future_of_belarus_under_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] will not run in the early presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Instead, Babariko, a candidate supported by [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Moscow]], is expected to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   This arrangement would lead to [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] gaining a new non-authoritarian president, while [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Russia]] secures control over [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   [[future_of_belarus_under_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] would move to [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Moscow]] and become secretary of a new State Council planned for [[political_transition_in_russia | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Threats and Resistance

While [[future_of_belarus_under_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] asserts he will never voluntarily leave his position, believing he was elected by his people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, it is suggested that if he becomes an insurmountable obstacle to [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Russia]]'s control over [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]], "troubles can befall him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. His confidence in his ability to survive is deemed exaggerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### [[impact_of_external_factors_on_belarusian_protests_and_opposition | External Factors and Russian Reserves]]

[[future_of_belarus_under_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] claims an [[impact_of_external_factors_on_belarusian_protests_and_opposition | external factor]] influences the rallies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. While American consultants in Warsaw are acknowledged as providing some help to the opposition, their role is not considered decisive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The primary [[impact_of_external_factors_on_belarusian_protests_and_opposition | external impact]] on events is attributed to the [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

[[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Putin]]'s statement about having prepared reserves to aid [[future_of_belarus_under_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] is interpreted as a desire to compel the Belarusian opposition and society to negotiate a compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This statement is largely seen as a rhetorical warning rather than an intent to use military force, as such an intervention would significantly damage relations between Russians and Belarusians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Putin]] had previously assured Merkel that [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Russia]] would not introduce armed forces into [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. The "reserve" mentioned refers to elements of the Russian Guard and OMON, with about 200-300 individuals currently present in [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]], including former Ukrainian Berkut fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Future of [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]]'s Independence

Should the proposed union treaty be signed, [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] would effectively become a "western province of the [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Russian Federation]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This would result in [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_its_relationship_with_russia | Belarus]] losing 95% of its national powers in favor of the union state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

The determining factor for future relations between [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Russia]], [[political_situation_in_belarus and its relationship with russia | Belarus]], and Ukraine is expected to be a very powerful and radical [[political_transition in russia | political crisis]] within the [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This crisis would change the nature of [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Russia]]'s relations with its neighbors, as [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Russia]] would become preoccupied with internal problems and [[russian_political_dynamics_and_influence_in_belarus | Putin]]'s departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

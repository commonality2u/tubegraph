The current situation is expected to develop "alarmingly faster, fleeting, and worse" than previously anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. There is a very high probability of facing the imposition of martial law on a general national scale throughout Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. In such a scenario, existing legal conflicts, including amendments to legislation, will become meaningless, and the law itself may cease to hold meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

The process of introducing "military serfdom" in Russia began on April 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, a "monstrous social regression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This process of enslavement of the Russian population will be successfully completed with the reduction of martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

The speaker notes that the coming months will bring changes no less significant than those experienced since February 24, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The upcoming year will require living in a state of severe, constant, and permanent [[strategies_to_cope_with_stress_and_crisis | stress]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Life, property, and modest savings will be under a constant and growing threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Losses are inevitable; one should be grateful if only money and nerves are lost, rather than lives, injuries, or illnesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. The current period is described as a "holiday of common misfortune," or more accurately, a "funeral feast," where the goal is to leave with the least losses, alive and well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

## Key Priorities

The two primary priorities during this period are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>:
1.  **Preserving your own life and health**, as well as the life and health of family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
2.  **Preserving your property**, including modest savings and business ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

All other matters, such as apartment repairs, non-essential purchases, or vacation plans, are secondary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. It's crucial not to try to solve everything at once, and some secondary tasks or needs may need to be forgotten or ignored due to limited time and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## Strategies for Survival

### Managing Stress and Seeking Support
*   **Acknowledge the stress**: It will be strong, almost constant, and will intensify over months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Seek support**: It will be impossible or extremely difficult to survive alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. People need others with whom they can share fears, concerns, and even cry, as this reduces stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **Role of Women**: Women play a primary role in building emotional balance and mental stability within the family, as men may more easily fall into prostration or panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Traditional Stress Relief**:
    *   Moderate alcohol consumption (excess intensifies stress and depression) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
    *   Sedatives for acute reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   Sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
    *   Sports and walks in fresh air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
    *   Pets and children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
    *   Specific stress relief techniques (not detailed here, but widely available) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Calmness**: The most important advice is "Calmness, the main thing calmness" or at least the absence of hysteria and panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
*   **Safe Haven**: A "safe haven" and "reliable friends or an extensive family" who can come to the rescue are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.

### Protecting Life and Health
*   **Avoid Risk Areas**: Avoid places and situations where risks, especially of being apprehended ("getting in for the good"), increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
*   **Understanding Mobilization and Enforcement**:
    *   Police, Russian Guard, and State Traffic Safety Inspectorate will be instructed to "comb the public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
    *   The "partial mobilization" from September last year, for which the completion decree was not issued, did not result in criminal or administrative prosecution for evading mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
    *   Even with martial law, risks of criminal/administrative prosecution for evasion may be minimal, with only demonstrative punishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
    *   The single register of military personnel for summonses will not be ready until autumn, but databases are already integrated enough to send summonses and "comb the public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
    *   The law's promise of 20 days notice for summonses is false; there will be no 20 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
    *   Blocking of accounts, bank cards, and driver's licenses will happen automatically and immediately, without notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Restrictions on civil and property rights, including travel abroad, will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
    *   Individuals stopped on the road may have licenses canceled and be immediately directed to military registration and enlistment offices, then to assembly points, and finally "into the fields" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
    *   Mobilized personnel will be expected to provide their own equipment (e.g., bulletproof vests), shifting to self-sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

### Protecting Property and Finances [[potential_effects_on_private_property_and_economy | Potential Effects on Private Property and Economy]] [[legal_and_financial_considerations_under_martial_law | Legal and Financial Considerations Under Martial Law]] [[recommendations_for_financial_and_personal_preparedness_amidst_crisis | Recommendations for Financial and Personal Preparedness Amidst Crisis]]
*   **Cash Reserves**: Always have a sufficient amount of cash for operational freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
*   **Bank Accounts/Cards**: Money can be withdrawn or transferred to trusted relatives or friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.
*   **Vehicles**: A general power of attorney will not protect car ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. Cars will be impounded, and owners will still be forced to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>. Compensation attempts are unlikely to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.
*   **Business**: Transferring business ownership may be difficult or impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. It's better to lose some money than a precious life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   **Legal Advice**: For business and property protection, seek immediate recommendations from lawyers to develop and quickly implement schemes to retain property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Always have a lawyer's phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
*   **Accept Losses**: Accept that some losses are inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

The speaker will provide further details on the dynamics of the situation and how to live with stress in an upcoming online meeting on April 13 at 8 PM Moscow time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

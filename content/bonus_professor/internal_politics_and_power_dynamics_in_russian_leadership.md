According to Valery Solovey, in the 154th episode of the program "What is Happening," several aspects of [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russian internal political dynamics]] and power struggles are discussed, particularly in relation to international events and potential leadership changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Influence of U.S. Elections on Russian Leadership
The U.S. presidential elections are considered the most important elections in the world, heavily influencing peace and international relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The [[russian_political_climate_and_leadership | Russian leadership]] specifically is determined by the results of these elections, impacting both [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russian domestic policy]] and international policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Elite Coalitions and Communication with Donald Trump
Hot on the heels of the U.S. elections, on November 6, two [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | Russian elite coalitions]], one led by Chemezov and the second by Patrushev, sent "enthusiastic congratulations" to Donald Trump through informal channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Trump responded to both messages, referring to the situation between Russia and Ukraine as an "incident" that it is "time to end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Kremlin's Vision for Peace
The [[kremlin_internal_political_dynamics | Kremlin]]'s proposed contours for peace with Ukraine include:
*   **Crimea**: Remains on the Russian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Donetsk and Luhansk Regions**: Remain on the Russian side within their administrative borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Territory Exchange**: Ukraine throws in the Kursk region in exchange for Russia giving up fragments of territories it controls in the Kherson and Zaporozhye regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Land Corridor to Crimea**: Previously, the Russian side insisted on retaining a land corridor to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. However, during a recent conversation, the [[kremlin_internal_political_dynamics | Kremlin]] stepped back from this idea, provided Ukraine guarantees unimpeded transit of goods and people from mainland Russia to the Crimean peninsula through Ukrainian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## The "So-Called Putin" and Leadership Challenges
The "so-called Putin," referred to as Evgeny Vasilyevich (a double), is described as "not very educated" and "not very smart," facing an "insurmountable intellectual challenge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. During an hour-long speech, this figure made 44 mistakes, including mispronouncing words, repeating words, and making long pauses, indicating significant difficulty in public speaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

### End of Career and Personal Concerns
It is claimed that the "Politburo 2" has decided to end the double's career as president of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. Despite being promised a "quiet, secure, privileged life," the double is concerned about his "survival," understanding the nature of those he deals with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

## Broader [[Russian political dynamics and leadership issues | Russian Political Dynamics]]
The "Russian elite" is responsible for determining the meanings embedded in public speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. The government, or more precisely the [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | government]], intends to emerge from the current crisis at the "expense of society, at the expense of the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[0:18:13]</a>.

Foreign countries, including those in the West and East (such as Arab nations, Saudi Arabia, and China), prioritize their own interests over initiating internal changes or supporting political struggles within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">.[00:16:23]</a> They view the Russian Federation with skepticism, believing that Russians are responsible for their own situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">.[00:16:45]</a>

## Western Interests

The primary interest of the West is the maintenance of stability in Russia, regardless of the ruling regime, even if it is "cruel and cannibalistic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">.[00:17:11]</a> The West's (likened to a "sheriff") promises are described as "vague" and decreasing in real size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">.[00:17:34]</a> This stance is characterized as cynical and shameless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">.[00:17:48]</a>

The West also aims to demonstrate to Ukraine that providing aid is futile, advocating for pressure on Ukraine to engage in peace talks instead of continuing to supply ammunition and weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">.[00:35:02]</a>

### United States and Israel

The United States' rearmament efforts and Israel's need for weapons and ammunition affect the supply of weapons to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">.[00:28:44]</a>

## Eastern and Arab Interests

Countries like Arab nations, Saudi Arabia, and [[Chinas_influence_on_russian_politics | China]] engage with the current Russian leadership (including the "double" of the president) because they anticipate receiving benefits or "goodies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">.[00:17:55]</a> For these nations, the current situation in Russia is considered "acceptable," if not optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">.[00:18:17]</a> They are focused on extracting advantages for themselves, not for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">.[00:18:08]</a>

Regarding [[RussiaChina_relations_and_influence | Chinese-Russian relations]], there is interest in how Western and Chinese English-speaking media cover these topics, as well as China and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">.[00:22:41]</a>

## Special Services and Foreign Influence

The nature and purpose of special services are often misunderstood; they are not "charity agencies" or "information agencies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">.[00:18:35]</a> The situation regarding [[foreign_agents_and_influence_in_russia | criminal groups]] and their control by the Russian leadership is described as complex and ambiguous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">.[00:24:30]</a> It is a "pernicious misconception" to believe that the government can readily use criminal groups in a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">.[00:24:50]</a>

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The primary development within Russia is the "construction of a new configuration of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This new configuration is intended to ensure "the safety of transits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> and provide "stability post-puncture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Ensuring Stability in a Non-Democratic System

In non-democratic systems like the Russian Federation, stability is maintained differently than in democracies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The Russian system has a "single and indivisible power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> concentrated in the executive, specifically presidential, authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Other powers, such as legislative and judicial, are considered "pathetic appendages" of the executive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

To maintain stability amidst opposing elite groups, it's necessary to:
*   Differentiate influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   Ensure mutual deterrence within these spheres of influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   Place "your people" to control specific spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   The risk of mutual destruction or paralysis among groups leads to system stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   Have a negotiating platform or moderator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The "late Putin" previously served as this moderator and coordinator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Proposed Changes and Key Players

The new configuration, planned for the fall, involves specific appointments and a new role for the State Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Prime Minister and Presidential Succession
It is assumed that "another person will become prime minister" in the near future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Denis Manturov's candidacy is being discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Manturov is described as a protégé of Viktor Chemezov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. The Chemezov coalition is considered as influential as, or even more influential than, the Patrushev coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

The preconditions for early presidential elections include the "resignation of Putin’s double," named Yevgeny Vasilyevich, who is currently "usurping the dubious and extremely unstable situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The current agreement is that one coalition will appoint the prime minister, but a different person will run for president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Nikolai Patrushev's coalition has promised that his son, Dmitry Patrushev, will be the presidential candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. If elected president, Nikolai Patrushev has pledged to leave any government position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### The Role of the State Council
A "negotiating platform" is needed for the key Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This role is assigned to the State Council, which is intended to become the "new Politburo" in the new power configuration, replacing the Security Council which previously held this role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

In this proposed system of checks and balances:
*   If Dmitry Patrushev becomes president, the State Council will be headed by Chemezov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   If the situation does not favor Nikolai Patrushev's wishes (i.e., if Dmitry Patrushev does not run for president or another person runs), then Nikolai Patrushev himself would head the State Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

A symptom of the formation of this new configuration is the appointment of Alexei Dyumin as Secretary of the State Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Dyumin has good relations with both Chemezov and Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. His role's significance will depend on the overall functionality of the State Council as the new Politburo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## Impact of [[potential_political_transition_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | Political Transition]]

The West's increased willingness to allow strikes on proper Russian territory is attributed to their understanding that "Putin is gone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. The West feared the "crazy and dangerously crazy" former leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, but views the current ruling group as more realistic and unwilling to escalate to thermonuclear war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This perception has led to a decrease in the perceived risks of escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

The massive use of Western weapons on Russian military and critical infrastructure will not lead to a "strategic turning point" in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. However, it is capable of weakening Russia's offensive impulse and causing serious damage to its armed forces and logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. The situation is expected to return to a "strategic impasse" by the turn of summer/autumn, likely by September of this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

This impasse, alongside the internal [[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | political dynamics]] in Russia, may incentivize a transition to direct peaceful consultations between Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>. A previous offer from Russia for peaceful consultations was rejected by Ukraine about a month ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The speaker suggests that by September, the perception of the situation might change on both sides, potentially increasing Russia's readiness for a "very broad compromise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. If the [[russian_government_changes | political transition]] unfolds in an unforeseen and destructive way for the Russian system, it could further impact Ukraine's strategic position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

## The Return of Yevgeny Prigozhin

Yevgeny Prigozhin has "returned to Russia" in the form of a full-length bronze monument erected at the Porokhovskoy cemetery in St. Petersburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. The speaker suggests he will "definitely return" in person to admire his monument <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>. This situation is described as "grotesque" and "macabre humor," reflecting the unpredictability of events in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

> [!quote] "Appreciate admirari" (don't be surprised at anything) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a> suits the description of what is happening in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>, especially in [[russias_future_political_system_and_governance_structure | Russian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. The most unexpected and unforeseen events will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.

The speaker concludes by stating that "very big events are brewing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>, the "biggest in the last 25 and possibly 30 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>, which will change Russia's trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

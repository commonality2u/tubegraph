Valery Solovey's 124th program, "What is Happening," aired on Monday, May 20, Moscow time, focused on the recent visit of a Russian delegation to Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The main topic of the episode highlighted how the "Chinese Bogdykhan bestowed the Moscow prince with a label for reigning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This phrase suggests a subservient role for the Russian side, receiving approval from China to rule Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

The visit, which included a "so-called president," a double named Evgeny Vasilyevich, and a representative delegation, was initiated by the "real masters of Russia" who sent the delegation to Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Moscow's Objectives

Moscow's goals for the visit included:
*   **Legitimization of the Double** The primary goal was to gain international acceptance for the "double" as president, by having China acknowledge him in that role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Influence on the Swiss Summit** The Kremlin aimed to [[chinas_stance_on_russia_and_ukraine_conflict | influence Beijing to not participate in the Swiss summit on Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Continued Military Support** Moscow sought guarantees of China's continued support for military operations against Ukraine, particularly the supply of dual-use products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. It was noted that without Chinese support, Russian military actions would subside within months and the economy would likely collapse within six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Banking Payments Resolution** The delegation intended to resolve issues with bank payments stuck in Chinese banks, which significantly slow down and reduce mutual trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Power of Siberia 2 Gas Pipeline** The Kremlin hoped to secure China's consent for the construction of the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Beijing's Objectives

Beijing had two main objectives for the visit:
*   **Assessing New Leadership** To observe the "new composition" of the Russian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Evaluating Secret Treaty Readiness** To understand Moscow's readiness to fulfill a [[secret_treaty_between_russia_and_china | secret treaty]] signed by the late Russian President Vladimir Putin with [[xi_jinpings_visit_to_moscow | Chinese leader Xi Jinping]] in February 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This treaty, hidden from the Russian public, grants China a 49-year lease of "gigantic territories" in Siberia and the Far East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This lease includes the right to develop natural resources and organize its own administration, effectively removing these territories from Russian jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This agreement was considered the price for China's support during the "special military operation" and is described as an "act of national treason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The treaty is set to come into effect on January 1, 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The Kremlin sought to postpone its implementation due to fears of a "monstrous scandal and domestic political crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

## Outcomes and Chinese Stance

The visit resulted in a "humiliating situation" for the Russian delegation, with China acting as a "master looking down on Moscow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Beijing did not provide a clear "yes" or "no" answer to Russia's requests, including the postponement of the secret treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

*   **Agreements Signed**: Several symbolically important, though not very significant, agreements were signed. One notable agreement concerned cooperation on Bolshoy Usuriysky Island, an island in the Amur River formally divided but considered entirely Chinese on Chinese maps without Russian protest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This is seen as a hint that the Kremlin is prepared to implement the secret agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Swiss Summit**: Contrary to Moscow's goal, China stated it would not mind sending a delegation to the Swiss summit on Ukraine, though not led by [[xi_jinpings_visit_to_moscow | Xi Jinping]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Economic Agreements**: No decisions were made regarding bank payments or the Power of Siberia 2 gas pipeline project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
*   **Overall Assessment**: The meeting primarily served for the "modest legitimization of the double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. This outcome is described as "offensive to Russia" and its national dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. The territorial integrity and national sovereignty of the Russian Federation were questioned due to the implications of the secret treaty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

### Humiliation and Control

The visit was characterized by humiliation for the entire Russian delegation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Notably, Russian "masters" Sergei Chemezov and Nikolai Patrushev did not attend, reportedly to avoid disgracing themselves or taking responsibility for the humiliating requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

The "one-on-one" meeting between the "double" and [[xi_jinpings_visit_to_moscow | Xi Jinping]] was not truly private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. In addition to a translator, individuals controlled the double from the Russian side to prevent him from saying anything "unnecessary" or "idiotic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Discussions during this meeting were vague, consisting mainly of "praises of wisdom, strength, and strong-willed dignity of the Chinese leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

Some members of the Russian delegation faced basic restrictions, including being denied access to toilets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. China also showed significant interest in Andrei Belousov, the newly appointed first deputy prime minister, viewing him as a potential "new strong man" with whom to conduct business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

The topic of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] has generated the most questions and remarks, with its contours described as increasingly ominous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Planned Mobilization
The intention is to [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | mobilize]] between 300,000 and 2 million people, which includes 300,000 women, after the New Year holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This [[political_address_and_military_mobilization_measures_in_russia | mobilization]] is planned in conjunction with the introduction of [[renewed_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. It is expected that the next mobilization will not be called "partial" but will be declared as a general mobilization, carried out with greater organization and toughness than the previous one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Enforcement Measures
Summonses are reportedly already prepared in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Individuals subject to mobilization are being entered into a facial recognition system database, such as the one used in the Moscow metro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This system allows authorities to approach individuals in the metro and direct them to mobilization points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. A database for the border service will include up to 7 million people potentially subject to mobilization, preventing them from leaving the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### Mobilization of Women
The plan includes mobilizing 300,000 women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Priority for women's mobilization is expected to be doctors and medical personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The speaker has doubts about whether the Russian authorities can provide sufficient uniforms and equipment for such a large number of mobilized people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The authorities believe this number of mobilized personnel will allow them to at least withstand Ukrainian offensives and cement Russian defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Martial Law
[[russia_moving_toward_martial_law | Martial law]] has already been introduced in the so-called "new territories" of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. It is anticipated that after the New Year, this [[impact_of_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] will be extended to either all of Russia or a significant portion of its territory, including Moscow and St. Petersburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Implications of Martial Law
[[possibility_of_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | Martial law]] grants authorities the right to:
*   **Labor mobilization:** Individuals not called to active military service can be subject to forced labor mobilization to strengthen the country's defense capability, applying to people aged 14 to 60 or 65 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Forced change of ownership:** This includes the possibility of forced changes in the ownership of organizations or enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. It is assumed that part of large corporate and private business property will be nationalized or transferred to "patriotic hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Seizure of private property:** Private property can be seized with subsequent compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that such measures are embedded in the martial law regime and will "definitely be implemented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

These measures are framed as a choice between "life" and "temporary inconvenience" for those who do not wish to participate in the [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The slogan for these operations will be "everything for the front, everything for Victory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Impact on Loans and Communication
In the event of a general mobilization, a deferment of loan and mortgage payments will likely be announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. If an individual dies at the front, their loans might be written off or offered on preferential terms for their family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

[[mobilization_and_the_state_of_the_russian_army | Martial law]] also provides for the possibility of restricting freedom of communication and the use of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. While YouTube has not been blocked because it is needed by the government for pro-government bloggers to distribute information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>, such restrictions are possible under martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

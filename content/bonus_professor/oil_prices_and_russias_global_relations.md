## Overview of Russia's Economic Dependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:12">[03:12:12]</a>
Russia's economy is critically dependent on oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:12">[03:12:12]</a>. While official figures suggest the Russian Federation has sufficient resources, including gold, foreign exchange reserves, and the National Welfare Fund, to support society and small to medium-sized businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:33">[02:54:33]</a>, government estimates indicate that money might only last until October or November if the current status quo persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:40">[03:21:40]</a>.

## The OPEC+ Deal Breakdown and its Ramifications
The decision to break the OPEC+ deal was made by Russian President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The exact reason for this decision remains unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, but the manner of refusal was perceived as offensive to the Saudis and other OPEC participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This led to a significant personal conflict between Putin and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, with the Crown Prince refusing to speak with Putin on the phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

### Underlying Conflict: The Khashoggi Scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>
Beyond the OPEC deal, the Saudis reportedly received information suggesting the Kremlin's involvement in the scandal surrounding Ashoka (likely Khashoggi) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. This alleged involvement included the distribution and replication of information through Russian agents and media in the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. The Kremlin's perceived logic was that a colossal scandal and subsequent US sanctions against Saudi Arabia, along with a hostile attitude from Europe, would push the Saudis into the arms of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. Following the scandal, [[russiachina_relations_and_influence | relations between Russia and Saudi Arabia]] did improve sharply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

The Saudis, particularly the Crown Prince, reportedly took an oath at a family meeting to take revenge, viewing the situation as a serious blow to their reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

### US Mediation and the Venezuela Deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>
Russia was forced to turn to US President Trump to influence the Crown Prince <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Trump played a key role in brokering the deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. In exchange for their participation in the deal, the Americans demanded that Russia leave Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. This involved Russia promising to stop supporting Maduro and evacuate him, potentially linked to the transfer of Rosneft assets to Russian state property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

## Current and Future Outlook on Oil Prices
Saudi Arabia's conditions for Russia included significantly reducing oil production, potentially twice as much as Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>. The Kremlin is now ready to agree to virtually anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Even at $25 per barrel, Russia could make ends meet if management changes and "Homeric scales" of stealing cease, along with a refusal of non-core expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

However, global economic growth is needed for high oil prices, which is unlikely to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. Prices are expected to remain in a low range not only for the remainder of this year but also for a significant part of next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

## Domestic Impact on Russia
### Economic Hardship and Public Discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:11">[03:07:11]</a>
The current economic situation, exacerbated by low oil prices and the pandemic, is dire. The government is reluctant to bear financial and legal responsibility to society like Western countries, which means it doesn't want to declare a state of emergency to avoid payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. There's an idea to depreciate the ruble to 100 per dollar to make up for lost budget revenues, but Putin is resisting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

The population is experiencing massive disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. Putin's electorate, traditionally uninterested in politics and staunchly supportive, has seen their sympathy turn to hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. People expected broad assistance programs, but received none, with responsibilities shifted to governors without resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. This has led to unprecedented despair and hatred among the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

### Putin's Leadership and Shifting Perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>
Putin's lack of confidence in his actions is notable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Historically seen as a factor of stability, for the first time in 20 years, he has become a factor of destabilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. An authoritarian regime is theoretically good for quick, tough decisions, but Putin is unwilling to take responsibility, instead shifting it to Moscow mayor Sobyanin and governors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

[!WARNING]
Putin, who has been described as having "scared the whole of Europe" for six years, is now unable to take responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

In his inner circle, there are whispers that "luck has left" Putin, who previously had a reputation as a very lucky person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. This perception of lost luck coincides with the confluence of the epidemic, falling oil prices, and a constitutional crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Geopolitical Implications
### Sanctions and International Aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:11">[03:07:11]</a>
There has been an active push in Russia to lift international sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. Trump has reportedly promised that the US will not tighten sanctions and may even try to soften them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. However, within the European Union, a consensus is required to lift sanctions, which makes it unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. The EU's diplomatic department is currently too absorbed in its own problems to discuss lifting sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

Longer term, if the epidemic subsides, there may be global discussions about mutual assistance and joint confrontation of threats, which *could* raise the question of lifting sanctions, especially if [[Geopolitical tensions and Russias international relationships | relations between Russia and Ukraine]] improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

### Russia's Ukraine Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>
Despite the internal crisis, Russia's intentions regarding Ukraine remain absolutely unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Russia believes that Ukraine will soon turn to it for logical help, similar to Russia sending military virologists to Italy and Serbia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. This is seen as a good option for Russia to leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

[!NOTE]
In the context of the crisis in Russia, interest in Donbass will likely decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. This could mean Russia stops active pursuit of its goals in the Ukrainian direction, depending on the scale of the crisis in Russia itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:11">[00:49:11]</a>.

Donbass is considered an important electoral resource due to the large number of people with Russian passports who have the right to vote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. The number of such passport holders is being formally increased to a million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>. This resource is considered "absolutely manageable" in terms of voting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>.

An offensive by Russia in Donbass could be expected if Russia needs to pressure Ukrainian leadership or distract from internal problems, especially when the crisis within Russia unfolds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>.

### Influence on US Elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:32">[00:52:32]</a>
The results of the US elections are quite important for Putin, who would like Trump to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:36">[00:52:36]</a>. Russia will attempt to help Trump, possibly through Ukrainian friends who will provide information on the Biden family's interests in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. This would be a "formally Ukrainian" but "actually Russian" effort to aid Trump <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

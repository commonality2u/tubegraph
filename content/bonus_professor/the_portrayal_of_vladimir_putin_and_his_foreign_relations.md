This article details the perceived actions and reception of [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Vladimir Putin]] and the Russian leadership in their foreign relations, particularly concerning military and economic alliances, and their diplomatic standing as of December 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Diplomatic Engagements and Setbacks

### Visit to Kazakhstan
In December 2023, a trip by the individual referred to as "so-called president" or "Putin's double Yevgeny Vasilyevich" to Kazakhstan was an attempt to increase imports through Kazakhstan and engage it more actively as an intermediary for supplying dual-use products to the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. However, Kazakhstan's President Tokayev politely but adamantly refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Tokayev indicated that Kazakhstan had exhausted its transit aid resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a> and that increasing import volumes to Russia via Kazakhstan would create serious problems for the Kazakh economy and financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Observers noted a clear mockery of the "double" in Tokayev's behavior, with Tokayev appearing to dominate the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. In response to this refusal, the individual identified as [[Vladimir Putin and his political strategies | Putin]] reportedly boasted about a "miracle weapon" capable of changing the strategic situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

### The Situation in Syria
Russia's position in Syria has weakened, highlighted by the fall of Aleppo to the Syrian Armed Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Russian specialists reportedly "evaporated into captivity or simply disappeared" during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. When Syrian President Assad sought military assistance in Moscow, the Russian leadership, like Tokayev, refused politely but adamantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The stated reason was that all available weapons, equipment, planes, and military personnel were diverted to the Ukrainian front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The Wagner PMC is no longer active in its previous form, and a similar analogue needs to be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The Russian side is perceived as looking "not very convincing" and "not very confident" in the regional game involving Turkey and Iran, having to retreat after what seemed like successes in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Military Aid and Negotiations
The Russian Minister of Defense, Belousov, travelled to Pyongyang, North Korea, to secure continued military aid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This visit occurred because the new American administration had begun consultations with China and North Korea, proposing to reduce the volume of military aid to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The Americans believe this is a way to compel Russia to enter negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Russia currently receives critically necessary ammunition, shells, and missiles from North Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Both Russia and Ukraine are experiencing a progressive inability to conduct intensive military actions due to depleted resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Ukrainian Stance on Peace Negotiations
Ukrainian President Zelensky, in an interview with Sky, made an "unprecedented statement" indicating Ukraine's readiness to abandon a military return of lost territories in exchange for NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Previously, Ukraine publicly sought the return of all lost territories to its 1992 borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Zelensky's statement, though formally addressed to a Western audience, is seen as preparing the Ukrainian domestic audience for a compromise with the Russian Federation, despite knowing that NATO membership is not immediately forthcoming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This indicates that Ukraine's leadership is now preparing its society for a compromise it previously rejected publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

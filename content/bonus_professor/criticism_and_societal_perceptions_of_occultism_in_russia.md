The topic of occultism and its [[influence_of_occultism_in_russian_politics | influence in Russian politics]] and society is a subject of ongoing discussion, often highlighted by notable public cases and perceived shifts within the elite's beliefs. While traditional views often condemn or deny such practices, there is a growing acknowledgment of their presence and impact on decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.

## The Case of Shaman Alexander Gabyshev

The forced psychiatric treatment of Alexander Gabyshev, a self-proclaimed shaman, exemplifies the complex interplay between politics and perceived magical threats in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Gabyshev was forcibly sent to a psychiatric hospital by court decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, ostensibly for political repression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. However, some believe the primary reason was a magical or [[occult_practices_in_russian_politics | occult]] concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

It is reported that a direct order from the President of the Russian Federation mandated that the shaman be "stabbed with drugs" to induce a "state of vegetables" or offer an alternative: private life under surveillance without "socially significant initiatives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This directive came just days after Gabyshev announced he had conducted a ritual to "drive out evil spirits" from the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The seriousness with which this perceived ritual was taken by the country's "supreme leadership" underscores the belief in such practices at high levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

Andrey, a philosopher, describes Gabyshev as belonging to a "cultural type of shamans whose worldview is based exclusively on mythology and folklore" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. His "rite of the stolen soul," common in Siberian-Mongolian cultures, involves a shaman battling a demon to retrieve a person's soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Crucially, the person whose soul is stolen must participate in the ritual, making a remote ritual for someone like Putin impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. From an esoteric perspective, Gabyshev's activities are considered insignificant compared to "sinister and bloody cults" or the practices of "13 world occult orders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

From a psychiatric viewpoint, forcibly hospitalizing Gabyshev is seen as punitive and a form of [[cultural_and_societal_repression_within_Russia | political repression]], giving rise to "even greater evil" for both the individual and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. Critics argue there is no convincing evidence that Gabyshev is dangerous to society or himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>, viewing him simply as an "ordinary person who has his own ordinary worldview life, a different position" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

## Perception by Russian Authorities and Elite

The Russian elite's [[mystical_beliefs_among_russian_elite | mystical beliefs]] and [[influence_of_occult_practices_in_russian_politics | occult practices]] are considered to deeply influence decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. The interest in such matters reportedly began in the early 2000s, driven by an interest in predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. A significant shift occurred around 2014, moving from simply seeing the future to actively attempting to "influence the future to change" it in the desired direction, as the future began to "develop not as expected" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

The pervasive nature of [[occultism and magical practices in Russia | occult practices]] among the elite is described as unparalleled in Russian history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. This phenomenon is partly attributed to "extreme mental instability" within the ruling class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. The sudden and seemingly unmerited ascent of these individuals to power has led them to seek rationalization and external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>. They believe they are "chosen by higher powers" and seek to communicate with these powers through operators and intermediaries to solve complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. This reliance on the occult is seen as a search for "the ring of omnipotence," a quest for a force to provide power and preserve resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>.

The current atmosphere within the elite is characterized by a "loss of all bearings" and a pervasive uncertainty about their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>. This instability, coupled with a belief in their own chosenness, drives them to increasingly "potent means" in the occult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>.

## Historical Context and Modern Shift

Historically, the Russian court's fascination with occult practices is associated with figures like Rasputin in the early 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. Rasputin was seen not just as a healer but as a political influencer at a time of "collapse" for the Romanov house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. This historical example illustrates moments when authorities feel "helplessly" unable to resist "evil fate" and seek "magical help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

However, the current situation in Russia is considered far more extreme than anything seen previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. While the early 20th century court exhibited a "rationality and Voltairean skepticism" by comparison, today's elite are immersed in a reality where the "interweaving of the occult and the political" is central <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This extends beyond simple astrology or fortune-telling, which are considered "prehistoric era" practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. The current [[occult_rituals_and_psychiatry_in_Russia | occult rituals and psychiatry in Russia]] practices are described as "more gloomy, more sinister and frightening" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>.

Even the Soviet security officers (Chekists) from the 1920s reportedly searched for the "ring of omnipotence" and engaged in experiments with parapsychologists and psychics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>. The Americans even borrowed experience from the KGB in studying parapsychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:08">[00:27:08]</a>. This reflects a historical lack of belief in their "own power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.

## The "Business" of Occult Services

The provision of [[occultism and magical practices in Russia | occult]] services to the elite is a "colossal business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>. It involves a "very closed" environment of "tested" individuals who have "practice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. While many are outright scammers, there's a small fraction of individuals who might genuinely possess abilities, similar to Rasputin who reportedly "stopped the blood" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.

The appeal of these services is rooted in a low "level of culture" and education among some in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. When a "respected character" introduces these practices, promising answers for a fee, individuals become susceptible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

Some common practices include "flights to Nibiru" and "flights to Sirius," which involve the use of local alkaloids like atropine, psilocybin, and mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. These rituals aim to create hallucinations and "thought forms" for communication with entities like "Reptiloids" or "owl heads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>. Regular participation leads to addiction and a "rapid personal transformation of degradation," causing individuals to perceive the "shifted reality" as their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:51">[00:34:51]</a>.

More extreme rituals, particularly for "evil" purposes, are described as increasingly relevant in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>. These can involve digging up fresh corpses, cutting them into pieces, mixing them with grave soil, and sacrificing birds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:47:57]</a>. Dolls carved from wood, resembling the "victim," are soaked in blood (not animal blood) and plant juice, buried in grave soil, and then fed with "the blood of a virgin and the sperm of men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:56">[00:48:56]</a>. Such practices are said to work primarily on a psychological level, fulfilling what the person "believes in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

Another relevant cult is Santa Muerte, which utilizes mummified corpses and requires followers to possess a human skull, preferably from an "influential person of high rank," as a "fool's skull" would lead to foolishness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>. These rituals are performed for "colossal money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## Societal Implications and Public Perception

The widespread propagation of pseudo-scientific and occult ideas through media outlets like Ren TV, which is reportedly financed by Kovalchuk, normalizes these concepts for the average person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. This public exposure, while seemingly contradictory to the "secret" nature of high-level rituals, may serve to legitimize the beliefs of the "initiated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

The belief that the elite has entered an "occult war" against "very powerful" forces (like "two or three" of the 13 world occult orders) shapes their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. This perception is not confined to Russia; similar views are reportedly held by some in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:38">[00:40:38]</a>.

The internal logic of these practices makes them appear "very logical" and "consistent" from the inside, even if they seem "strange, incomprehensible, monstrous" from an external perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. This situation contributes to a broader sense of [[moral_and_social_degradation_in_russia | moral and social degradation in Russia]], as those in power make critical decisions while operating in a "shifted reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.

## Role of the Traditional Church

The traditional Russian Orthodox Church faces internal crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a> and adopts various strategies regarding these non-traditional occult practices:
1.  **Avoidance, condemnation, and denial** of these practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>.
2.  **Calm treatment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>.
3.  **Participation**: some religious figures or those associated with the church are believed to participate in these practices, seeing them as a "real path to power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>.

It is noted that the Russian elite, in their search for a "powerful master" or force, are increasingly turning away from Orthodoxy and Christianity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:25">[00:56:25]</a>. This trend has become "more and more noticeable" in the last "five, six years, decades" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:37">[00:56:37]</a>.

The church's ability to "retain" influence is questioned, given that the "highest echelons" of power, who make decisions about the church itself, are deeply involved in these practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:17">[00:57:17]</a>. There is a perception that the church and occult practices "get along quite well and peacefully" in this niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. The historical oversight of the Russian Orthodox Church by state security committees also contributes to public skepticism regarding its spiritual authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:37">[00:58:37]</a>.

## Conclusion

The presence of [[occult_practices_in_russian_politics | occult practices in Russian politics]] and among its elite is portrayed as a significant and unsettling reality, not just a historical curiosity. It reflects a profound level of "mental instability" and a desperate search for power and control in an uncertain world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. While public discussion of these phenomena is often avoided or seen as unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:22">[00:59:22]</a>, it is suggested that signs of this reality can be observed in the behavior of high-ranking officials and public information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>.

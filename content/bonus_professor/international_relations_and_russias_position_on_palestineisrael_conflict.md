Following recent political shifts within Russia, there has been a notable change in the country's [[geopolitical_tensions_and_russias_international_relationships | international relations]], particularly concerning the Palestine-Israel conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This shift is presented as a feature of a "new political reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

## Withdrawal of Support for Palestinians

Russia is reportedly withdrawing from supporting the Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This decision stems from [[russian_diplomacy_and_international_relations | behind-the-scenes negotiations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. The process began with a telephone call from Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>, followed by direct negotiations with the current Russian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

The primary objective of these negotiations from the Israeli side was to ensure that Russia would cease providing assistance to Palestinians and international terrorist networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. The aim was to minimize Russia's involvement, at least while Israel conducts its armed military operation in the Gaza Strip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## Leverage and Political Implications

The speaker suggests that Israel achieved this diplomatic outcome through a form of leverage, hinting or bluntly blackmailing Russian officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. The "exchange item" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a> involved the threat to reveal the secret regarding the state of health and whereabouts of the Russian president, who was described as being "alive but deeply unwell" at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. This pressure from the "extremely convincing Israeli leadership" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a> compelled the Russian side to comply.

This shift in [[influence_of_international_relations_on_russian_politics | Russian foreign policy]] is presented as a significant indicator of the "new political reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a> within Russia.

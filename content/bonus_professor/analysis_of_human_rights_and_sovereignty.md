This article provides an [[valery_solovievs_political_analysis | analysis]] of the Russian president's speech before the Council on Human Rights and Civil Society Development on December 7th, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. According to the speaker, the speech reveals the president's "mental state and mental style," which helps in understanding his motivations and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. There is a "huge distance" between the president's words and actions, a distance that is "constantly increasing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

The Human Rights Council itself is described as a "specially selected body" where questions are "preliminarily approved by the administration and then personally approved by the president," ensuring no "uncomfortable and disturbing" topics are raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The speaker summarized Putin's speech with the phrase, "What do you want from a sick mind," stating this is not a metaphor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## International Doctrine of Human Rights and State Sovereignty

The Russian president asserted that "the international doctrine of human rights is used to destroy the sovereignty of states" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The speaker countered this by listing elements of this doctrine: free elections, separation of powers, freedom of movement, and inviolability of personal property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The speaker questioned if these freedoms threaten any state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, concluding that they only threaten "the state the basis of which is the power of criminals thieves and bandits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Donbass and National Interests

The president claimed that the rights of Donbass residents were violated, and that Russia was considered a "second-class country" with no right to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. His proposed solution was a "consistent struggle for their national interests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The speaker critically examined what "national interests" Russia is defending, pointing to poor domestic conditions such as 25% of toilets being outdoor facilities, and vast, dying territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The [[ukraine_russia_conflict_analysis | special military operation]] has accelerated the population decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

The speaker noted the contradiction in Russia's stance: criticizing Ukraine for violating human rights in Donbass while asserting that human rights doctrine destroys state sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. If human rights undermine sovereignty in Russia, they should logically undermine the sovereignty of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Logical Inconsistencies and the President's State of Mind

The speaker attributes these "logical inconsistencies" to a "certain type of thinking characteristic of those people to whom President Putin belongs," suggesting it is a "group with certain medical indications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

The president stated that the war was not started by Russia but by Ukrainian authorities after a coup in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This is a common theme in Russian propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. However, the speaker cited Igor Strelkov-Girkin, a prominent figure in the "Russian world" movement, who repeatedly stated he began the war in Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

The president also claimed that a nationalist group in Poland seeks to take western Ukrainian territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. The speaker dismissed this as "marginal groups" making statements, comparing it to Russian State Duma deputies demanding Alaska's return, and questioning their mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Poland, by contrast, is a major sponsor of Ukraine, providing military and humanitarian aid, and accepting Ukrainian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. No Polish state official has made territorial claims against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

Ironically, Putin claimed Russia is the "only guarantor of the sovereignty and integrity of Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, despite the [[ukraine_russia_conflict_analysis | special military operation]] leading to Ukrainian territories being incorporated into Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. This contrasts with the Budapest Memorandum, which Russia signed, guaranteeing Ukraine's security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Protecting the Rights of Russians

The president believes Russia needs to protect the rights of Russians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>. However, the speaker highlighted issues with the rights of mobilized citizens, noting problems with equipment that surfaced after 9 months of the [[ukraine_russia_conflict_analysis | special military operation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. The president's statements regarding rehabilitation for the wounded, prosthetics, drugs, and travel accessibility are only now being discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

## Nuclear Weapons and Mobilization

The president stated that Russia's nuclear weapons are "only as a means of protection" and for defense "by all available means" if nothing else is left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. The speaker interprets this as a recognition of Russia's ability to deliver a "first nuclear strike" under the guise of a "counter retaliatory strike," calling it a "very dangerous statement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

Regarding mobilization, Putin stated that "the conversation about additional mobilization does not make sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>. The speaker, however, argued that preparations for "additional recruitment" are underway, with agendas prepared and military commissars awaiting orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. The speaker believes that if a "people's war" concept is adopted, martial law and "full mobilization" with millions of people will be declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. The speaker warned against believing Putin's words, noting his past reversals on pension reform and constitutional changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. The lack of a decree on the end of partial mobilization indicates future plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

The president also stated that the [[ukraine_russia_conflict_analysis | special military operation]] is "designed to last a long time," implying a continuous need for human resources and rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. The operation absorbs a quarter of the Russian Federation's budget, meaning funds for social programs, pensions, and maternity capital are diverted to military expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>. The disappearance of 1.5 million sets of uniforms and the revelation that 200 billion out of 300 billion frozen Russian reserves were missing suggest widespread theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

The only "positive effect" mentioned by Putin was the Sea of Azov becoming an "inland sea of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>. The speaker criticized Russia's internal state, describing it as "unkempt" and "lying as if in ruins," with millions living without gasification or basic amenities like indoor toilets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. The speaker emphasized that Russia should focus on putting its own land in order rather than acquiring more territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

## Conclusion on the President's State of Mind

The speaker concluded that the president genuinely believes his own statements, despite their inconsistencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>. This "type of thinking" is "classified as medicine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. The speaker reiterated the phrase, "What do you want from a sick consciousness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>. The speaker expressed concern that this individual is running Russia, which is a "grief and misfortune" for both Russia and its neighbors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>.

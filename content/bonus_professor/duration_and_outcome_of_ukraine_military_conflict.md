From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The speaker, Valery Solovey, addresses questions regarding the duration and potential outcomes of the [[ukraine_russia_conflict | military actions in Ukraine]].

## Predicted Duration
The speaker does not share the Pentagon's pessimistic view that [[ukraine_russia_conflict | military actions]] could "drag on for three years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Instead, he believes the outcome of the [[ukraine_russia_conflict | military conflict]] will be "predetermined even before the summer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This does not imply an automatic cessation of hostilities, as actions "can still continue after that but rather by fading inertia and in attempts to find the best way out for a political solution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Factors Influencing the End of Conflict
The cessation of [[impact_of_military_actions_on_ukraine_and_nato_responses | military actions]] is linked to the removal of Putin from power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. The nature of the cessation depends on who succeeds him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>:
*   If "the most likely contenders" come to power, [[impact_of_military_actions_on_ukraine_and_nato_responses | military actions]] will "not automatically cease" and might even "experience some intensification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This intensification would be short-term, as this new force would need to "bargain for itself the best conditions for leaving Ukraine" and "ending the armed confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Potential Scenarios for the Conflict
*   **"Korean Version" (Frozen Conflict)**: The likelihood of the conflict freezing, leading to Russia's "deepest self-isolation" and "greater degradation of all spheres of life," is assessed as "extremely extremely low tending to zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Nuclear Outcome**: The speaker does not rule out a nuclear outcome in the event of an "unfavorable development of events at the front" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>, stating that the "Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Federation leaves this option acceptable for himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>. However, he expresses hope that it will not come to a point where the execution of such an order needs to be verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.

## Broader Changes and the Year 2023
The year 2023 is highlighted as significant, with a "very high probability" for an opportunity to "change their own fate and the fate of their children grandchildren and the fate of their country for the better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The speaker anticipates a "clear and distinct signal when the time comes to act" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

It is believed that China is interested in the "earliest possible completion" of the conflict because, as an economically developed country dependent on international trade, it "needs peace for trade for economic development in the world, and not in military action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.

On Thursday, October 26th, at approximately 9 pm, Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly died in his Valdai residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This event aligns with prior public predictions that Putin would not survive the fall, likely dying even earlier, no later than October <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Immediate Aftermath and Concealment Efforts

Following Putin's reported death, there have been attempts to hide the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This practice of concealing the deaths of leaders in authoritarian regimes is not unprecedented, with examples including Heydar Aliyev, Hugo Chavez, and Islam Karimov (whose deaths were hidden for three months), and Zhirinovsky (whose death was concealed for a month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Despite efforts to suppress it, information tends to spread faster when met with more refutations and lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This creates an "information shell" that expands like a snowball, engaging new groups in the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The government's typical errors in managing such information, rather than ignoring and containing it, often lead to wider dissemination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Use of a Body Double
The concealment of Putin's death is facilitated by the successful replacement of him with a body double, known as a "deuce" in the professional jargon of the Federal Security Service and Presidential Security Service, for the past two to three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This "deuce" can be utilized for a short period, estimated at a maximum of two to three months, to manage the transition to [[the_future_of_putinism_without_putin | post-Putinism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## [[russian_political_situation_and_governance_issues | Future Political Developments]]

The current attempt is to maintain the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This indicates that there will be no new liberties or freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, and no reduction in military tension on the fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Instead, there might be further tightening of controls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, driven by the government's fear of public reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. A decision was reportedly made in October, when Putin was no longer capable of negotiating a strong position with Ukraine, to continue this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. Therefore, de-escalation is not expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

However, despite these immediate challenges, the speaker expresses confidence that the situation is not dire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

> "The process has started" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

Putin's death has "torn the core out of the regime he created" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>, initiating its downfall like an avalanche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. It is believed that the regime cannot be saved under any circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

A "window" is beginning to open, signifying the start of new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The future will depend significantly on the actions of the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. It is seen as a crucial time to "choose the right side of history," advocating for freedom and justice for Russia and for changing its future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

> "Events will soon develop very quickly, I would even say rapidly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

The speaker expresses certainty that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

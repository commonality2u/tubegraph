## Speculation on Russia's Future Political and Military Actions

Valery Solovey's 51st program, recorded on February 19th, 2023, discusses a "crusade against Putin" and the Russian response, including its offensive and the potential implications of various revelations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The program aims to provide insight into the future and its practical benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Western Stance: A "Crusade Against Putin"

The recent Munich conference, according to Solovey's sources, effectively declared a "crusade against Mr. Putin personally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The conference emphasized two main theses:
1.  The West is deliberately working to inflict military defeat on Russia and strip it of all territorial acquisitions in Ukraine, including Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
2.  No threats from Putin or Russia, including the use of nuclear weapons, will deter the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

It appears the West is deliberately provoking Putin to react harshly, possibly to incite decisive action from his inner circle to prevent "inadequate actions" by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### China's Ambiguous Position

China's stance, articulated at the Munich conference, is described as "very interesting and ambiguous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. While China expresses categorical opposition to unilateral sanctions, it is "reluctantly and slowly, drifting towards the position of the Western coalition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. The Chinese representative insisted on peace and is prepared to present its own "Peace Plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This plan is based on "respect for the sovereignty of both parties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, which implicitly means Russia must renounce its territorial claims from Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

The fact that China intends to present this plan soon suggests it has been working on it for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This implies that China, Russia's "reliable Chinese Partner," does not believe in the possibility of a Russian Federation victory or President Putin's strategic genius <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. A potential meeting between Xi Jinping and Putin was conditioned on Russia achieving a decisive victory or agreeing to peace; the first option is now considered "crossed out" by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Expected Russian Response: Verbal and Practical

Russia is expected to respond to the Western "ultimatum" both verbally and practically (militarily) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

#### Verbal Response: Putin's Message to the Federal Assembly

The verbal response is anticipated in Putin's message to the Federal Assembly on February 21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Historically, the Kremlin inflates information before such addresses, creating "information bubbles" that burst without significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The only previous message that announced something serious was in January 2020, when constitutional reform was declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

There are several options for the upcoming message, categorized by their degree of radicalism:
*   **"Horror-Horror" Option:** Putin declares a "people's war on NATO" to the "last Russian," potentially leading to general mobilization and martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. However, there are currently no signs this option will be chosen, and Putin himself might be afraid of such a radical decision given his past experience with the February 24, 2022 decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **"Horror" Option:** To compensate for military failures in Ukraine and respond to the West's ultimatum, Russia could announce new "victories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This might involve:
    *   The inclusion of South Ossetia and Abkhazia into Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
    *   The declaration of independence of Transnistria with a subsequent "geopolitical throw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
    The speaker views these potential announcements as "hypothetical propaganda messages" that even "deceived Russians" would treat with irony or misunderstanding, as most don't know the geography of these regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **"Usual Nonsense" Option:** The president delivers a typical speech with many threats and hints, but without announcing any concrete decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Putin likes to "throw a pebble into a pond and looks at the circles that diverge" to gauge public reaction before making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

The final decision on which option to choose will be made just hours before the address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

#### Practical Response: A New Offensive

The practical part of Russia's response is expected to be a new military offensive, aiming for quick success before Ukraine receives advanced Western weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. These advanced weapons are seen as capable of significantly increasing Russian losses and are key to Ukraine's counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

However, Russian military personnel are reportedly reluctant to go on the offensive, believing it would be a "big mistake" and that there is "practically no chance of success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. This reflects the poor moral and psychological state of the Russian armed forces and command staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. Russia also faces an "acute shortage of weapons" and is relying on "remnants of Soviet weapons," lacking new, advanced weaponry in sufficient quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

#### Mobilization Challenges

While Putin desires to announce a new mobilization, and technical preparations are ongoing, an open, massive mobilization has not occurred for two reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>:
1.  **Logistical Issues:** The required quantity of uniforms could not be fully prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
2.  **Putin's Fear:** Putin, the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, is "afraid" of such a large-scale mobilization, despite reports that previous partial mobilizations were successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. He also prefers unexpected actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

### Lukashenko's Disbelief

Even Alexander Lukashenko, Putin's closest ally, demonstrates "completely obvious disbelief" in the strategic talents of the Russian Supreme Leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>. Lukashenko was observed "openly trolling the Russian president" during their meeting on February 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. This suggests Putin lacks confidence even in himself, let alone in the Russian armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

### The Risk of Nuclear Weapons

If the Russian offensive fails and the command staff's reluctance turns into "sabotage," Putin, who "cannot suffer defeat," may reach for the "nuclear baton" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. Both China and the West have warned against this, but the West has also made it clear it is "not afraid" of such a threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

While the probability of nuclear weapon use is often cited as low (e.g., two to three percent), the speaker considers this "colossal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. Putin is psychologically and morally ready for this, though the speaker hopes he will be unable to implement such a decision even if an order is given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a>. The world has not been so close to the possibility of nuclear weapon use since the Cuban Missile Crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.

### Seymour Hersh's Nord Stream Revelations

The revelations by Pulitzer Prize winner Seymour Hersh regarding the explosion of the Nord Stream pipelines are briefly mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. The speaker asserts that the information provided by Hersh has "absolutely no relation" to reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>. The source of Hersh's information is believed to be non-Russian, surprising even Russian propaganda, which was bewildered by its publication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>. The speaker suggests Hersh was "played blind," implying his "dementia state and the tendency to conspiracy theories" were exploited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

### Outlook on Russia's Future

The speaker emphasizes that [[possible_future_political_changes_in_Russia | changes are close]] and that 2023 has brought them "as close as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>. He anticipates a signal for action and encourages support for "important humanitarian initiatives" aimed at Russia's development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>. The speaker remains confident that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>.

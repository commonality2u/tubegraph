The winter offensive by the Russian armed forces on the Ukrainian fronts has concluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This campaign is described as having an "inglorious end," with the exception of the prolonged and bloody storming of Bakhmut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner PMC, has openly complained about the lack of shells and high losses during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Notorious figure Igor Strelkov also stated that the winter campaign ended "without result," anticipating the enemy's next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Nature of the Offensive

There are indications that the "grand offensive" may have been more of an imitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This imitation was seemingly designed to manage the supreme commander-in-chief's expectations, demonstrating forward movement, even if only "meter by meter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. In most directions, even this minimal progress was not achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## General Gerasimov's Role

The primary reason for this imitative offensive is attributed to [[general_gerasimovs_appointment_and_strategy | General Gerasimov]], who is recognized as an "excellent planner" and "the best commander of the Russian armed forces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Gerasimov reportedly understands that the Ukrainian side is likely preparing a counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Preparation for Counteroffensive

In anticipation of this, Gerasimov's strategy involves:
*   **Building a line of defense** This defensive line, previously known as the Surovikino line, is now expected to be called the Gerasimov line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. A significant portion of [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_Russia | mobilized]] personnel are involved in digging trenches and creating this line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. The hope is that Ukrainian forces will be repelled by this defense, leading to a transactional position where negotiations might begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Preserving equipment and accumulating shells** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Preserving the remaining professional army** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

The "imitation offensive" was carried out to achieve these objectives, particularly in directions that were supposedly covered, though it likely amounted to little more than "reconnaissance in force" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The Russian side is now preparing for a defensive posture against the anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

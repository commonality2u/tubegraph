The surrender of the Azovstal fighters is considered by Russian propaganda to be the primary and most significant outcome of the past week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Military and Symbolic Success for Russia

This event is acknowledged as a genuine military success and an important symbolic victory for the Russian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Not a Strategic Turning Point

Despite being a success, the surrender of the Azovstal fighters does not signal a strategic turning point in the "special military operation" or the armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This is contrasted with other ongoing developments, such as successful Ukrainian counteroffensives, including the [[russian_troop_withdrawal_from_ukraine | withdrawal of Russian troops]] from Kharkiv <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, and fierce, unsuccessful battles for Russia on the Siversky Donets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Fate of the Azovstal Fighters

There are two probable scenarios for the Azovstal fighters:
*   **Public Trial:** Participants from the Azov Regiment, which is deemed an extremist organization in Russia and labeled as a "Nazi regiment" by official Russian propaganda, will likely face a public trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This is intended to demonstrate to Russia and the world that the demands for the "denazification of Ukraine" were justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Prisoner Exchange:** Fighters not associated with the Azov Regiment will likely be exchanged for Russian prisoners of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The decision on when this exchange will occur rests personally with the President of the Russian Federation, guided by the prevailing political situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Russia's Shifting Strategic Goals

For at least two weeks, both sides have been in a "clinch" or positional fight, hoping to achieve a strategic military advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. However, signs emerged last week that the Russian Federation is increasingly moving away from seeking a [[strategic_outcomes_of_the_ukrainian_offensive | strategic turning point]] and instead aims to consolidate the new "status quo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Russia seeks to legitimize its current territorial gains through negotiations with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

This [[military_and_strategic_implications_in_russia_ukraine_conflict | strategic shift]] is evident in several ways:
*   **Revival of Russian Agents of Influence:** There has been a resurgence of Russian agents of influence in European Union countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. For example, former Italian Prime Minister Berlusconi, a personal friend of Putin, publicly stated that Europe must convince Ukraine to accept Russia's conditions for negotiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Diplomatic Initiatives:** The Italian Foreign Ministry simultaneously sent proposals to Ukraine for the [[end_of_military_actions_in_ukraine | end of the conflict]], which could be quite favorable to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. French and German politicians are also implicitly or explicitly suggesting that Ukraine make peace "here and now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

The conditions Russia seeks to legalize include:
*   Recognition of Crimea as Russian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   Recognition of Donbas as independent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   Recognition of territories in the [[withdrawal_of_russian_troops_from_kherson | Kherson region]] and parts of the Zaporizhzhia region, establishing a land bridge to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Reasons for European Pressure

Several factors contribute to European leaders' cautious push for peace:
*   **Russian Leverage:** Russia reportedly has leverage over some European politicians, including French President Macron and German Chancellor Scholz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The United States has also reportedly made it clear to Scholz and Macron that it possesses compromising information on them, advocating for adherence to Euro-Atlantic solidarity and NATO's unconditional support for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Fear of Escalation:** European leaders fear an escalation of the conflict, which could lead to the use of non-conventional weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Refugee Burden:** Escalation inevitably increases the number of refugees. Approximately six million refugees have already left Ukraine, imposing a significant financial and social burden on EU countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Global Famine Threat:** The ongoing conflict severely limits Ukraine's ability to export grain, raising concerns about a global famine due to disrupted logistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Russian propaganda and officials actively exploit this threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Ukraine's Stance and Future Plans

Ukrainian President Zelensky maintains that the outcome of the conflict will be determined on the battlefield, and peace negotiations will only begin once one side achieves a military advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Ukraine's intention for a strategic turning point is supported primarily by the Anglo-Saxon duo (Great Britain and the United States), as well as Poland, the Baltic countries, and other European nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This support includes "unconditional support of Ukraine" and "waging war to a victorious end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

Ukraine is reportedly making serious plans for a counteroffensive, aiming to achieve technological and military superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This offensive is likely to occur by the end of summer or early autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Ukraine's far-reaching plans aim to restore the territorial status quo, at minimum to February 24, and potentially include Donbas and even Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## Russian Concerns and Preparations

Ukraine's stated intention to launch a counteroffensive is causing tension on the Russian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Russian propaganda suggests that Ukraine crossing the Russian border would be a disaster, implying that such an action would reset all of Russia's territorial gains, possibly even in Donbas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
Russian military officials, particularly the General Staff, are reportedly expressing a realistic view that Russia might lose these new territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The acquisition of new territories by Russia is immediately followed by the construction of defensive fortifications, indicating that Russia is preparing to defend these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

Despite official statements from Russian functionaries, such as Turchak declaring Kherson "forever with Russia," there is skepticism about the stability and permanence of the new territorial "status quo" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Historical parallels suggest that such pronouncements of permanence often prove to be temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The vice-premier responsible for construction, Khusnullin, benefits from the "gold mine" of restoring territories like Mariupol and Kherson, where budget financing is colossal, and if the status of the territory changes, accountability for expenditures vanishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

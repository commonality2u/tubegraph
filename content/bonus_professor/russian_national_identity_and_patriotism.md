The concept of [[patriotism_and_national_identity | Russian national identity and patriotism]] is explored through various statements and addresses in the transcript, highlighting a unique national character, the vastness of the country, and a focus on unity and resilience.

## Perceived [[patriotism_and_national_identity | National Character]]

A distinct character is attributed to a "Russian person," capable of performing difficult tasks, such as drinking "with shaking hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This resilience was humorously demonstrated in a theatrical performance by People's Artist Lebedev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Another cultural reference, "Stop drinking and get on his skis," implies a time for action and responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## The Beloved Fatherland

[[Russian_Political_Climate_and_Mobilization | Russia]] is frequently referred to as "our beloved country" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, a "free fraternal peoples Union" extending "from the southern thieves to the Polar region" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The country's vastness is celebrated, with "our forests and fields are spread out generally free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The sentiment suggests Russia is unique and "alone in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Emphasis on Practical Skills and Historical Pride

A sense of pride in practical skills and a connection to the [[internal_russian_political_dynamics_and_changes | Soviet past]] is evident. The speaker recalls being a "fourth-category carpenter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, a qualification earned while working in a student detachment in the [[russian_internal_politics_and_economy | USSR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This skill, which allowed for decent earnings at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>, is something the speaker remains "proud of" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. The anecdote of showing proof of this skill to a "President of the United States" further underscores this unique aspect of personal and, by extension, national experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

## A Call for Unity and Future Building

A New Year's address strongly emphasizes unity and collective responsibility. Citizens are encouraged to "move forward to create the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. The past year is recognized for hard work, common achievements, and firmness "in defending the [[patriotism_and_national_identity | national interest]], our freedom and Security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. The ability to overcome "colossal challenges" and "solve complex problems" is attributed to the "Solidarity" of the people and their "colossal responsibility for the Motherland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. The address also highlights the importance of family, new families, and the birth and healthy upbringing of children as key to the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

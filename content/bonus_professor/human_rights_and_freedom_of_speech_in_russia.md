The current state of [[Media censorship and freedom of information in Russia | media censorship]] and public perception in Russia is heavily influenced by state [[Media censorship and freedom of information in Russia | propaganda]]. The speaker highlights that state propaganda is "imbued with Jan hatred of Ukraine" and poses the question of how to extract the "zombified part of the Russian population" from a "coma of absolute and sinister delusion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Combating Propaganda and Restoring Freedoms

To counter the prevailing [[Media censorship and freedom of information in Russia | propaganda]], the speaker proposes that the state propaganda machine must be "switched off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It is believed that after this, a significant portion of society (though not all) would "come to its senses" within a relatively short period, up to six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The objective is to change the "climate in the country from malignant to benign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> by turning off the "state propaganda machine which is hostile to everything human everything honest everything fair everything humane and the inclusion of other narratives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Individual Freedoms and Opinions

The speaker emphasizes the importance of [[Prospects of freedom and democracy in Russia | freedom of thought]] and free will. They state that "people are endowed with free will freedom of thought and freedoms include the right to make mistakes and even to be an idiot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, referencing a statement by US President Biden about the "right to idiocy" being a "liberal nity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This implies that differing points of view should be respected.

## Legislative and Judicial Reforms

Regarding [[Repressive laws and political commentary in Russia | repressive laws]], the speaker's team plans to immediately repeal laws concerning the blocking of various internet resources once they come to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>. This would be an "automatic" action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>.

In terms of the judicial system, all officials of category A will have their cases reviewed, including figures like Golikova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. The judicial system's current decisions are seen as exhibiting a "common cognitive error" where people are "not able to imagine a future different from the present" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>, despite impending "absolutely crazy changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>.

### Restoring Constitutional Legality

Special departments, possibly within the Ministry of Internal Affairs or as a separate commission, will be created for the "restoration of constitutional legality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. These departments will focus on civil and political rehabilitation, as well as property matters for those who were forced to flee Russia due to fabricated criminal cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:41">[00:34:41]</a>.

## Public Desire for Change

There is a significant public demand for values associated with [[Prospects of freedom and democracy in Russia | democracy]]. While people may not use the term "democracy," there is a "huge request" for values such as "equality, a functioning court, the values of competition, the values of freedom of movement, the values of competitive elections" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. The speaker asserts that "no one wants to live in poverty, lack of rights and dispa, no one wants it except for a group of perverts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>, and that "all normal people want the implementation of democratic and liberal values" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

Despite these desires, a majority of the population is described as "tired" and living by "ready-made formulas" provided by [[Media censorship and freedom of information in Russia | propaganda]], representing a "process of saving energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. Even with significant events occurring, such as personnel reshuffles in the Ministry of Defense, a considerable group of people will continue to deny changes, asking "And what And what happened still remained the same as it was" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. The speaker notes that "there are people who, even if they have a goal on their heads, they will not see anything they will not hear anything and they don't want to understand anything and there are a lot of such people, to be honest, there are actually a majority of such people, unfortunately, especially in Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

The current [[political_situation_in_russia | political situation in Russia]] is characterized by an ongoing [[political_crisis_and_economic_implications_in_russia | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. While it's possible to predict the entry into a [[potential_political_crisis_in_russia | political crisis]] with over 75% accuracy, predicting its course or results is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. However, active participation from the beginning of the crisis offers tangible chances to influence desired outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Phases and Duration of the Crisis

The most acute phase, or "peak," of the crisis is expected to last only a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, but the crisis itself will extend over several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Power Dynamics and Influence

Within the current [[political_situation_in_russia | political situation in Russia]], those who oppose Nikolai Patrushev are as influential as he is, making opposition difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The pursuit of "power in Russia and power over Russia" can blind individuals to rational thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. An example given is Patrushev's perceived stubbornness, which could destroy the Putin regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

The strength of coalitions, such as those led by Patrushev and Chemezov, is described as equal, with Chemezov's possibly being stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Role of State Institutions

In the upcoming crisis, state institutions like the Prosecutor General's Office and Investigative Committee are expected to align with the winning side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. In the acute phase, they may not play a direct role due to a lack of armed resources, but they can serve as instruments for one of the competing coalitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA) is likely to become subordinate to the winning side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. A preferable position for the MIA leadership might be neutrality, akin to a "fortress plan" where police stations close themselves off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. The Ministry of Defense is also expected to take a neutral stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, while the General Staff's main department could play an important role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Societal Impact and Post-Crisis Reforms

Following a change of power, several reforms are anticipated:

*   **Justice and Lustration:** Those who committed crimes, such as beating protesters or issuing unlawful sentences, will be prosecuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. All court employees will undergo lustration without exception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. The taking away of service housing for those involved is not yet confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Pensions:** The old retirement age is planned to be reinstated within a year to eighteen months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>. Those affected by the increased retirement age will receive compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.
*   **Minimum Wage:** The minimum wage (MW) is planned to be increased at least two to three times through internal resource redistribution and a reduction in theft and corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Housing and Mortgage Prices:** Housing prices and mortgage costs are expected to decrease significantly due to rationalization, increased efficiency, and establishing order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Currency:** The ruble faces unfavorable prospects, suggesting that stocking up on dollars or euros is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Medicine:** Retired individuals and those in difficult social circumstances will receive vital drugs for free or with significant discounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:34">[00:28:34]</a>.
*   **Weapons Legislation:** The regular tightening of weapons legislation reflects the authorities' fear of armed citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>. The right to bear arms may be introduced in Russia after military actions conclude and society recovers mentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.
*   **Personal Data Leaks:** The new government intends to combat massive personal data leaks from government agencies, punishing those involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. This problem is expected to be largely resolved within two to six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>.

## Geopolitical Considerations

### Ukrainian Front and Peace Negotiations

The Russian Federation desires to take Kharkov but currently lacks the military strength for such an operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. However, the Ukrainian front could collapse, or chance could play a significant role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. While the speaker's team actively participates in efforts to stop the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, peaceful negotiations between Ukraine and Russia are possible both before and after a coup in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

### War Crimes

The speaker's political force is definitively positive about investigating and punishing war criminals and those guilty of crimes against humanity after the war's end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

### Putin's Status

According to the speaker, Putin is not alive, and Ukrainian intelligence, including from Western intelligence, is well aware of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. The entire top Russian elite also knows this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>.

### Nuclear War

The possibility of a nuclear war is theoretically not excluded, but practically, despite rhetoric, the real chance of conflict is very small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

### Territorial Status

*   **Kaliningrad Region:** Its fate depends on whether the Kremlin launches a hybrid operation against the Baltic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>.
*   **Crimea:** Crimea is not expected to face a good outcome regardless of how the situation develops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.
*   **Siberia and Far East:** A hypothetical possibility exists for these territories to fall under China's protectorate, but this is expected to tend towards zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
*   **Hybrid Operations in Baltics:** A preliminary hybrid operation targeting Baltic countries, particularly Latvia and Estonia, is scheduled for summer-fall of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. The preparatory stage has not yet begun, but a structured plan exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

### Kremlin's Foreign Policy

*   **Georgia:** The Kremlin has largely implemented its plans for Georgia, with the Georgian leadership under strong Kremlin influence, evidenced by the adoption of the foreign agent law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. However, the Kremlin cannot influence Georgian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.
*   **Armenia:** The Kremlin wishes to punish Armenia due to Nikol Pashinyan's leadership but is currently unable to do so as resources are diverted elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>.

## Internal Dynamics

### Terrorist Acts

Security officers are actively working to prevent further terrorist acts in Russia, especially by Islamic terrorists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

The current authorities in Russia do not care about the significant number of people (one-third to half) experiencing PTSD from military actions, which leads to inadequate and socially dangerous behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. This is seen as a fundamental aspect of the current Russian state's relationship with society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>.

### Elite Conflict

The elite war will not escalate into a civil war or the collapse of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. While armed excesses are probable, they will be localized, likely in the center of the Russian capital, and may even avoid actual weapon use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>. A large-scale civil war is not expected due to a lack of necessary conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. However, there is a risk of a split or withdrawal of some territories, with the North Caucasus being a particularly dangerous zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.

### Future Leadership and Political Systems

*   **Prigozhin:** Yevgeny Prigozhin is expected to make contact and reappear in the Russian Federation at a time he deems most favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>.
*   **Monarchy:** The idea of restoring a monarchy in Russia, possibly a new dynasty, is considered by the speaker for the very distant future (15-20 years), serving as a symbol of unity and guardianship of law and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>.
*   **Chemezov as President:** While theoretically possible, Chemezov, like Patrushev Sr., reportedly has no desire to be president, preferring to govern or influence Russia from behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:36">[00:39:36]</a>.

## Miscellaneous Topics

*   **WHO Pandemic Agreement:** The speaker has no information on whether Russia will conclude a pandemic agreement with the WHO, stating that any such agreements have no real effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.
*   **WTO Membership:** Russia's membership in the WTO is viewed calmly; it neither interferes with nor significantly helps the country, and no country has left the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>.
*   **Sirius Sochi Project:** The Sirius educational complex for gifted children is currently functioning for its proclaimed purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:12">[00:23:12]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency:** There are no plans to ban cryptocurrency or crypto exchanges in Russia, as the country needs to utilize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Cash Withdrawal Limits:** In the event of a spontaneous financial crisis, freezing deposits is not excluded, meaning limited cash withdrawals from accounts will be imposed, with card limits tightened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **Palace in Gelendzhik:** The continuous rebuilding and re-equipping of the palace in Gelendzhik, featured in Navalny's film, is described as a "gigantic theft of budgets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. The actual inhabitant is irrelevant, as the main goal is theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.
*   **Social Media Blocking:** Exercises to block social networks and video hosting platforms were largely unsuccessful, so there are currently no plans to close YouTube, Telegram, or WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57">[00:39:57]</a>.
*   **Stalin's Death:** Stalin was not prevented from dying and was not given timely medical care, as depicted in the film "The Death of Stalin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.

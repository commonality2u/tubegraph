The topic of [[russian_political_and_military_mobilization | mobilization]] has re-emerged, with discussions around President Putin and the Kremlin's intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Potential for Nationwide Mobilization
There is a perception that [[possibility_of_mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | nationwide mobilization]] is not off the table and is being considered by the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. It is speculated that a meeting of the State Duma, possibly on July 15, could potentially be for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. While a July 15 announcement isn't certain, a later date might be more logical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## Obstacles to Announcing Mobilization
There are two primary obstacles to announcing a nationwide [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization process in Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>:

1.  **Image and Reputational Obstacle**: The Kremlin's consistent assertion that the "special military operation" is proceeding "according to plan" for four months creates a paradox. Announcing [[possibility_of_mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] would imply that the plan is not going well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, contradicting the narrative of a low-cost victory on foreign territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
2.  **Political and Social Complications**: There is uncertainty about how Russian society, particularly residents of large cities, would react to a [[general_mobilization_readiness_in_russia | nationwide mobilization]] announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This represents a significant risk of [[social_and_political_implications_of_mobilization_in_russia | social and political complications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Proposed Stages of Mobilization
A potential first stage of [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] could involve introducing [[internal_russian_mobilization_and_possible_martial_law | martial law]] in five frontline or border regions adjacent to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The reaction to this initial step would then be assessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

It is also noted that announcing [[possibility_of_mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] during the summer might not be ideal, as many potential conscripts are dispersed and currently unreachable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Societal Preparation for Mobilization
A "negative mobilization" is reportedly occurring in the Russian Federation, where some are called to the armed forces while others face repressions to prevent dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. The recent sensational cases involving hockey players, such as Ivan Fedotov being sent to the North for service, and accusations against three others for illegally acquiring military tickets, are seen as part of an informational, moral, and psychological preparation of society for [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

This serves as an "exemplary flogging" to demonstrate that everyone, regardless of fame, will be treated equally under [[general_mobilization_readiness_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. However, the government is reportedly unsure that society will react positively, and it is doubtful that half a million people would voluntarily report to military enlistment offices if [[possibility_of_mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] were announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a>.

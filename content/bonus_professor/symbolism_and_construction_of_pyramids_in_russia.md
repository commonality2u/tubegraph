The construction of pyramids has emerged as a peculiar phenomenon in Russia, particularly among the elite, reflecting a growing interest in [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | occultism and magical practices]]. This trend is closely linked to [[mystical_beliefs_among_russian_elite | mystical beliefs among the Russian elite]] and concerns surrounding the longevity and influence of leaders like Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Modern Pyramid Construction

Pyramids are being built in various locations across Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. One notable example is a pyramid near Tomsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Patronage:** This specific pyramid project is reportedly undertaken by a group of businessmen, potentially connected to Prigozhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The developers are said to include deputies from United Russia and large businessmen in Tomsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Architect:** The architect identified for this project is Valery Uvarov, known for designing the "Crystals and Lounge" spa and salon in St. Petersburg, whose owner was reportedly offered Prigozhin's "love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Location Significance:** The choice of Tomsk is thought to be tied to an archaeological expedition in the late 1980s. This expedition uncovered a small complex from the late Bronze Age, where four graves were found containing inventory items related to Egyptian culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. While the presence of Egyptian artifacts is attributed to ancient trade routes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, a conspiracy theory links the pyramid's location to Alexei Navalny's poisoning in Tomsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

Another anecdote mentions a farmer in southern Russia who built a large pyramid on his field, claiming it cured him of diseases, increased his cattle, and boosted crop yields, though he subsequently went bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Symbolism and Purpose of Pyramids

The construction of these pyramids in Russia reflects a deep dive into the mystical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>:

*   **Tombs:** One interpretation, drawing from the pharaonic period of Egyptian pyramids, suggests they are intended as tombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Mystical Power:** According to Russian [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | black ideas about pyramids]], they are endowed with mystical power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This belief suggests a hierarchical structure within such a "pyramid," with a political subject at the top, followed by shamans (often former USSR party workers), and at the bottom, a "well-known Russian folk doctor Malakhov" for prolonging life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Reversing Misfortune:** The surge in occult practices, including pyramid building, is seen as an attempt by the current government and elite to counteract perceived misfortunes and the "exhaustion of luck" experienced by the leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, particularly after events like August 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. This reflects a desire to prolong life, heal, or gain benefits in the afterlife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Historical Context of Pyramids

Understanding the modern Russian fascination with pyramids benefits from looking at ancient pyramid construction:
*   **Ancient Egypt:**
    *   **Official Version:** The pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty of the Ancient Kingdom are credited with building the three great pyramids on the Giza plateau and the Sphinx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Most other pyramids were built as tombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. However, the remains of pharaohs were never found in the three great pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   **Modern Version:** Some theories suggest the civilization of ancient Egypt was built upon the ruins of an older civilization, to whom the three great pyramids and the Sphinx are attributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
    *   **Step Pyramids:** Built during the Third Dynasty, these were *not* used for mystical rites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Mesoamerica:** Step pyramids in Mesoamerica, such as temple complexes in Palenque and Chichen Itza, *were* used for performing mystical rites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Nepal:** Today, three small pyramids in the labyrinthine tunnels of the Ligand Gorge in Nepal are used for ritual purposes by shamans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Broader Context of Occultism

The pursuit of pyramid building is part of a larger trend of [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | occult and magical practices]] within the Russian elite. This is seen as a way to "deceive history" or "challenge fate" in the face of perceived decline and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. The widespread belief in supernatural solutions, even among officials and the financial elite, highlights a societal shift where traditional political and economic instruments are seen as failing to change reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>. This includes consulting astrologers, fortune-tellers, and shamans, reflecting a widespread belief in a "miracle" that can alter their circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:15">[00:40:15]</a>.

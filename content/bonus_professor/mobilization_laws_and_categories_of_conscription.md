This article outlines the legal framework and categories of individuals subject to conscription during [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]] in Russia, as discussed by Valery Solovyov.

## Introduction to Mobilization
[[Mobilization_and_military_readiness | Mobilization]] refers to the transfer of a country's state structures, economy, and everyday life to a war footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. The decision to mobilize is intrinsically linked with the introduction of martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.

## Legal Grounds for Mobilization
The decision to mobilize can only be made by the President, based on federal laws and potentially new [[legal_amendments_concerning_military_mobilization_in_russia | legal acts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

Primary laws governing [[legal_grounds_for_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] include:
*   Federal Law 31: "On mobilization preparation and [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   Federal Constitutional Law: "On Martial Law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   Law: "On military duty and military service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### Types of Mobilization
[[Mobilization_and_military_policies_in_Russia | Mobilization]] can be either [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | partial mobilization]], concerning specific territories, or a [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | full mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. It is assumed that even if [[potential_mobilization_and_military_service_changes_in_russia | mobilization]] begins as [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | partial]], it will likely develop into a full national [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

### Grounds for Martial Law
Reasons for introducing martial law, which precedes or is associated with [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]], are listed in the Law on Martial Law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>:
*   Bombing of Russian Federation territory by foreign armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   Attack by foreign armed forces on Russian Federation armed forces, regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   Exile of armed gangs, groups, regular forces, and mercenaries by a foreign state to carry out aggression against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

It is stated that these three points are formally observed, providing [[legal_grounds_for_mobilization_in_russia | legal grounds]] for martial law and subsequent [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation has also suggested the possibility of a Ukrainian provocation involving chemical means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

## Categories Subject to Conscription
Citizens in the reserve who do not have the right to a formal deferment are subject to conscription for [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

### Men
*   Men with a military ID, aged 18 to 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
*   Fitness Categories: "A" (fully fit) and "B" (fit with minor restrictions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   Those with fitness category "V" (limited fit) who receive a military ID after 27 years old, can also be mobilized from 27 to 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

Reservists are distributed among three categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>:
*   **First Category (Privates):** Men under 35 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
*   **Second Category:** Up to 45 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.
*   **Third Category:** Up to 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
Conscription will start with the first category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.

### Women
Women are also subject to conscription for [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]] if they have the necessary education and military registration specialty, primarily in medical fields but not exclusively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

## Categories Not Subject to Conscription
Individuals may receive a deferment or are not subject to conscription under current law:
*   Persons liable for military service reserved for civilian needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.
*   Category "G": Temporarily not fit for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
*   Those caring for relatives or disabled individuals who require supervision, confirmed by medical certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.
*   Guardians of minor brothers or sisters if there are no other guardians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
*   Parents with four or more children dependent up to 16 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.
*   Single parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
*   Pregnant women after 22 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
*   Senators and deputies of the State Duma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
*   Those with an unexpunged or unexpunged conviction for a serious crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>. Petty hooliganism does not provide an exemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.
*   Those who received a category "D" at the draft board, meaning generally not fit for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.
*   Individuals who have not served and have not received a military ID up to 27 years old, as they are not considered to be in the reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   Students of scientific educational institutions studying in the scientific form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
*   Certain categories of citizens may be granted a deferment by the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.
*   Exceptions exist for female military personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Note on [[legal_amendments_concerning_military_mobilization_in_russia | new legal acts]]
> New [[legal_amendments_concerning_military_mobilization_in_russia | legal acts]] can be adopted, which might alter the content of existing regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

## [[mobilization_process_in_russia | Mobilization Process]] and Consequences
All citizens subject to conscription are obliged to appear at assembly points within the timeframes specified in [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

### Summons and Orders
*   Orders can be delivered at home or at the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
*   Summons/orders may be presented by employees of the military registration and enlistment office, or by police patrols or Russian Guard patrols <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.
*   Those registered for military service are prohibited from leaving their place of residence once [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]] is announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
*   If they receive orders or a summons, they are obliged to appear at military commissariats or other authorities performing these functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

### Valid Reasons for Not Appearing
According to federal law on military duty and military service, valid reasons for not appearing on summons include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>:
*   Illness or circumstances leading to loss of ability to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.
*   Serious health condition of certain relatives or the death of relatives, requiring participation in a funeral (Article 7, paragraph 2 of the law) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

### Penalties for Evasion (Peacetime)
*   **Not appearing on summons (military registration and enlistment office):** Administrative liability in the form of a warning or a fine from 500 to 3000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.
*   **Evading military service (Criminal Code Article 328):** In peacetime, this can result in a fine of up to 200,000 rubles or imprisonment for up to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Wartime Penalties
> The speaker does not know the specific punishment in wartime, as martial law will likely be declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>. He advises that it is "better to lose a little money than a precious life and no less precious health" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.

## [[consequences_and_strategies_for_individuals_during_mobilization | Consequences and Strategies for Individuals]]
In addition to patrols appearing for those subject to [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]], a decision was made to block bank accounts and cards of those subject to [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]], and to close travel abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.

### Financial Advice
*   Individuals can transfer money to relatives' accounts or withdraw cash in advance to bypass account blocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.
*   Most people in Russia are not wealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

### Travel Restrictions
*   It is advised to keep a foreign passport in a safe place for quick access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

### Geographic Impact
[[Mobilization_and_military_readiness | Mobilization]] will primarily affect residents of small and medium-sized cities, and only last of all large cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Urgent Consideration
> Individuals are urged to think about strategies *now*, before [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]] is announced, as it will be too late to think and decide once it begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. This includes making decisions with family or oneself and developing an algorithm of actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications of Mobilization
[[Mobilization_and_military_readiness | Mobilization]] is not merely a call for military service but a transfer of the entire country to a military footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:02:00">[15:02:00]</a>. This includes the already frail Russian economy and the not very strong financial and banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.

*   Private businesses could be affected, for example, by the confiscation of cars needed for transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>.
*   The impact on the banking system is unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>. It is estimated that blocking bank cards of those subject to [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]] will lead to a financial "hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:45:00">[15:45:00]</a>.

Valery Solovey presented the 48th episode of "What's Happening" on Monday, January 16, discussing topics including demobilization, General Gerasimov, and strange deaths [00:00:30].

## Overview of the [[Militarypolitical situation in Russia and Ukraine | Military Situation]]
The [[Militarypolitical situation in Russia and Ukraine | military situation]] regarding relations between Russia and Ukraine is described as "getting worse and worse every day" [00:01:33]. Vladimir Putin acknowledges that the situation is not good and that the "special war, an operation, it is time to somehow end it" to "emerge victorious" [00:02:21].

## General Gerasimov's Appointment and Military Strategy
General Gerasimov was appointed as Chief of the General Staff and commander of a group of Russian troops in the special military operation zone [00:01:40]. This appointment is not the sole reason for the current situation [00:01:50]. Despite a "spectacular victory" of capturing Solidarity after an assault that began in August – a process noted to be much slower than the taking of Berlin – the situation on the fronts is "not so good" [00:01:51].

Gerasimov is described as "the best Russian General," an "excellent planner," a person with "strategic thinking," and an author or co-author of the "concept of hybrid warfare" [00:02:45]. Putin has granted him "special emergency powers," demanding "victory" in return [00:02:58]. The definition of victory remains an "open question," possibly implying "honorable conditions of peace personally of President Putin" [00:03:13].

There is a high probability of a Russian armed forces offensive in the coming months, as supported by Western media and intelligence services [00:03:30]. Concurrently, Ukraine is also preparing for an offensive, soon to receive tanks, considered a "breakthrough weapon" [00:03:46]. For Ukrainians and Russians, this is a "monstrous national tragedy" [00:04:04].

## Political Underpinnings of Military Appointments
One reason for Gerasimov's appointment is purely [[Military dynamics and morale in the Russia Ukraine conflict | military]] [00:04:14]. Another is [[Militarypolitical situation in Ukraine and Russia | military-political]] [00:04:16]. Yevgeny Prigozhin, a protégé of Putin, had become "excessively strong" and created "a whole galaxy of influential ill-wishers" [00:04:20]. These adversaries influenced the president, leading to Gerasimov, an opponent of Prigozhin, being placed in a position where Prigozhin's forces are subordinate to him [00:04:41]. This occurred while a significant portion of Prigozhin's fighters allegedly died during the assault on Solidarity [00:04:55].

However, the President of Russia is not interested in Prigozhin being "removed from circulation" [00:05:24]. Prigozhin is viewed as a "reliable" and "effective tool" for Putin [00:05:31]. Prigozhin himself is preparing for "Putin's future," having formed a resource base, controlling significant finances, media resources, and enjoying political weight and influence [00:05:42]. His attempts to form a military resource based on his personnel met with success until he received an "unexpected refurbishment from the president and part of the elite who decided that such excessive strengthening is not the president lithium is useless" [00:06:03].

## Mobilization and Military Service
Rumors of a new stage of mobilization have been circulating, which President's press secretary Peskov refuted as "sabotage and provocations" [00:06:43]. However, these rumors are paradoxically spread by the current authorities themselves [00:07:02].

Examples include:
*   The cancellation of deferment from mobilization for fathers of many children [00:07:07].
*   Information about increasing the upper limit of conscription for military service to 30 years from 21 years old, starting in spring [00:07:19]. This is considered a "hidden form of mobilization" [00:07:36].
*   Discussion about increasing the length of military service to two years, likely to be resolved positively by the fall draft [00:07:44].

These preparations suggest Russia anticipates a "quite long time" in confrontation with Ukraine or "with the whole world" [00:12:34].

## Military and Political Dynamics in Spring 2023
Significant military events are expected in the spring [00:08:11]. Both sides are preparing for offensives [00:08:14].
*   From the Russian side, this could be a "combination of strategic defense against the Ukrainian offensive and then a transition to a counteroffensive" [00:08:27].
*   From the Ukrainian side, the strategy might be to wait for Russian troops to "go on the offensive to be exhausted and then Ukraine will launch its counterattack" [00:08:37].

Ukraine will eventually receive tanks, which will play a decisive role in what is anticipated to be "the most significant military battle of the 21st century," unfolding in the steppes of Ukraine [00:08:53]. These events will "predetermine the outcome of the armed confrontation [and] political outcome military confrontation between the Russian Federation and Ukraine" [00:09:21]. This is expected in spring [00:09:35].

Russia's demographic resource, with a population three to three and a half times larger than Ukraine's, is a key factor [00:09:38]. Russia aims to "resettle Ukraine more in the army" [00:09:54].

The Times newspaper, citing MI6, reports that Russia is preparing for a "second stage of mobilization" [00:10:13]. This stage will be stretched into several parts, with the first wave mobilizing up to half a million, and a total of up to 2 million people [00:10:20]. The same newspaper also states Russia is preparing for an offensive [00:10:37].

## Economic Impact and Military Spending
Russia's main source of foreign exchange is oil and gas exports [00:12:46].
*   Russian Urals oil fell below $40 per barrel (specifically $38.7) around 10 days prior, marking a record low since summer 2020 [00:12:53]. This decline in export revenues will lead to "serious problems" for the budget [00:13:23].
*   With a price ceiling being introduced from February 5, Russia could lose $100 billion to $180 billion in foreign exchange earnings [00:13:29].
*   These budgetary losses will be compensated "at our expense" (the citizens') [00:13:53]. The armed forces and security forces (Russian Guard, police, FSB, Federal Protective Service) will be financed to the maximum [00:14:02]. Social expenses and economic development spending will be cut, akin to "guns instead of oil" [00:14:15].

To offset losses, Russia is attempting to increase oil exports; in January, exports reportedly increased by one and a half times compared to December [00:14:41].

## [[Russian nationalism and political tensions | Political Tensions]] and Strange Deaths
There is a "black humor" prevalent in the Kremlin [00:10:50]. A popular joke asks who will die faster: Nikita Mikhalkov or the CSTO (Collective Security Treaty Organization) [00:11:00]. While Mikhalkov is alive, the CSTO is seen as "breathing on lat" [00:11:08]. The Armenian leader Pashinyan stated that Russia is not a defense threat and that the UN should provide peacekeepers [00:11:17]. The fate of the CSTO is likely predetermined this year, heavily dependent on the [[Military dynamics and morale in the Russia Ukraine conflict | military dynamics]] starting in spring or late winter [00:11:32]. A Russian defeat, whether crushing or moderate, would render the CSTO's existence meaningless [00:11:57].

There have been a series of "strange deaths" in the defense industry over approximately three weeks [00:15:04]:
*   **January 9**: Pavel Kamenev, scientific director of Almaz Antey and developer of Caliber missiles, died at 85 or 86 years old [00:15:13].
*   **December 28**: Vladimir Nesterov, general director of the Khrunichev center who led the heavy missile project, died at 73 years old [00:15:43].
*   **December 24, 2022**: Alexander Buzakov, general director of the Admiralty Shipyards and manufacturer of Caliber missiles, died at 66 years old [00:16:04].

These three deaths of individuals involved in design work in the defense industry do not appear to be coincidental [00:16:26]. This trend is compared to "suicides or strange deaths of SL employees last year," which are usually hidden [00:16:40].

## Speculation on Putin's Doubles
There is speculation that the Russian president's alleged trip to Ufa to say goodbye to the first Bashkir president, Murtaza Rakhimov, was actually made by one of his doubles [00:17:23]. It is suggested that this was the "first main double" of the president, with mentions of 22 doubles [00:17:42]. This double reportedly "very successfully coped" with the role, meeting with the current Bashkir president and giving fewer interviews to journalists [00:17:48]. This situation is compared to Akira Kurosawa's film "Kagemusha" (Shadow of the Warrior), where a double replaces a killed prince [00:18:02]. The film's story ends tragically for both the double and the principality [00:18:44]. The speaker notes that the practice of using doubles existed in medieval Japan and in other countries, "not only in the modern Russian Federation" [00:18:57].

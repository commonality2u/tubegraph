The recent arrests of high-ranking military personnel in Russia have given rise to discussions about a "military mutiny" or "military underground" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>, a term reminiscent of the Soviet Union in the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This narrative suggests that "valiant military counterintelligence" has exposed and begun to "strangle" a supposed "hydra" connected to Khodorkovsky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. The speaker employs sarcasm when discussing the alleged "Trotskyite military conspiracy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Recent Military Arrests

Over the past month, five high-ranking military personnel have been arrested, four of whom are generals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

*   **Timur Ivanov and Kuznetsov**: Their arrests are largely attributed to an economic background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Army Commander Popov and Vadim Shamarin**: The deputy of Gerasimov, their arrests, while formally accused of economic crimes, are suggested to have a different, possibly political, underlying reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. For instance, Ivan Popov was accused of stealing 12 tons of metal products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Fifth Arrest**: A colonel or lieutenant colonel involved in purchasing [[military_products | military products]] was also arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

The arrests of two generals, Popov and Shamarin, are considered to have a political background, a topic openly discussed in Moscow expert circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Possibility of a Military Rebellion

Despite the official narrative of exposing a mutiny, the speaker sarcastically notes that a rebellion in Russia is certainly possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This was "brilliantly demonstrated" by Yevgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin on June 24 of the previous year, when he initiated a rebellion and nearly reached Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Prigozhin's Status
> The speaker dismisses recent photos and videos claiming to show Yevgeny Prigozhin in Chad as fake or outdated, stating that Prigozhin was not in Africa and is no longer in Latin America, but is in "tempting proximity" to Russian borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Historically, an attempt at a military rebellion also occurred in 1998, organized by General Lev Rokhlin, which had "good chances for implementation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

The key question is not whether a rebellion was actually being prepared within the General Staff or Ministry of Defense, or if two or three generals and two dozen colonels were involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Rather, military counterintelligence could easily falsify and inflate such a case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Implications of Discussing a Military Mutiny

An army engaged in intensive [[military_operations_and_strategic_goals | military operations]] for years naturally begins to acquire "political subjectivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. While there's a "huge distance" between seditious conversations and the actual preparation of a mutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, the fact that a military mutiny is being discussed and has become "part of the political reality in Russia" is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

This discussion serves as a "completely clear, obvious," and "ominous sign of the weakness of the political system and the weakness of the regime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. The regime, although often called the "VM Putin regime" to suggest its preservation, is in fact "beginning to disintegrate" and "weaken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, in its "Answers to Hot Questions" program, discusses the emerging contours of mobilization and martial law, which are expected to have significant [[impact_of_political_actions_on_russian_society_and_economy | political and economic impacts]] on Russia after the New Year holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. These contours are described as "increasingly ominous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Expansion of Mobilization and Martial Law

A significant expansion of mobilization is anticipated, potentially involving up to two million people, including 300,000 women, after the New Year holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. This mobilization is planned in conjunction with the introduction of martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. Martial law has already been implemented in the "new territories" of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a> and is expected to extend to either all of Russia or a significant portion of its territory, including Moscow and St. Petersburg, after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. This new phase of mobilization will not be called "partial" but will be declared as a "general mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

## Implications of Martial Law on Property and Labor

The introduction of martial law grants authorities extensive rights, impacting both labor and private property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

### Labor Mobilization
Martial law allows for labor mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Individuals not called up by the active army, particularly those aged 14 to 60 or 65, could be subject to labor mobilization and sent to work to "strengthen the country's defense capability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

### Property Seizure and Nationalization
Martial law includes the possibility of:
*   **Forced change of ownership:** This allows for the forced change of ownership of an organization or enterprise, meaning companies can be taken away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   **Nationalization of private business:** It is assumed that some large corporate and private business property will be nationalized or transferred to "right patriotic hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Seizure of private property:** There is also the possibility of seizing private property with subsequent compensation, though the speaker expresses doubt about the fairness of such compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

These measures are embedded in the martial law regime and are expected to be "definitely implemented" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## Financial and Economic Outlook

The speaker foresees a period of significant economic instability and hardship.

### Currency and Deposits
*   **Frozen Currency Deposits:** Currency deposits held by ordinary citizens are already frozen and cannot be withdrawn in foreign currency; they are effectively converted into rubles. The speaker has serious doubts that these will ever be accessible in their original currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.
*   **Ruble Depreciation:** While ruble deposits are not directly threatened with confiscation (as the central bank can print more rubles), the ruble is expected to "catastrophically depreciate" during a crisis, becoming "unstable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   **Recommendations for Savings:** For savings, the speaker advises holding assets that are easily movable and usable as a means of payment or exchange for rubles, primarily suggesting dollars over euros unless there's specific European travel or business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Gold is also mentioned as a potential option, with a note about the wide buy/sell spread and storage difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   **No Complete Ban on Leaving Russia:** While a database of up to 7 million people potentially subject to mobilization will be shared with border services, a complete ban on leaving Russia is not anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. However, a partial ban for those in the mobilization database will be easy to enforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

### Real Estate and Other Assets
*   **Decreasing Asset Prices:** Many assets in Russia are currently getting cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
*   **Selling Assets:** The decision to sell apartments or cars, even below market price, to withdraw funds from Russia depends on individual strategy and plans, especially if one intends to leave the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   **No Mass Nationalization of Residential Property:** The speaker does not believe that ordinary apartments will be nationalized, differentiating the current situation from pre-1918 events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   **Regional Differences:** The situation regarding property will be highly contextual. For example, those living near the Ukrainian border (e.g., Belgorod) may consider selling housing assets, even at a low price, due to escalating risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

### Broader Economic Impacts
*   **Government Spending:** While financing for social sphere repairs and reconstruction will likely be reduced, spending on the defense industry is expected to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Food Security:** While major food shortages are not expected next year, "disruptions" related to logistics may occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Food rationing or food cards are being prepared in some regions, not due to scarcity, but to ensure access to cheap provisions for "socially vulnerable groups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.
*   **Long-term Outlook:** The speaker predicts a period of "disorganization and chaos," suggesting that the "90s" might seem like a "faint reflection of what we will experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. The year 2023 is expected to be even harder than 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Russia is projected to face "poverty, mass poverty and a meager budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
*   **Pension Reform:** It is considered unlikely that the pension age increase will be cancelled or that people will be compensated for lost pension payments due to the country's projected financial state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

This article explores the alleged connection between Russia and the Hamas attack, and how the new war in the Middle East may affect the [[russianukrainian_relations_and_military_tensions | Russian-Ukrainian confrontation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Alleged Russian Involvement in Hamas Actions
Based on indirect data and insider information, it is suggested that Russia was involved in the actions of Hamas against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This involvement was reportedly carried out under a foreign flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

The alleged involvement is described in three aspects:
*   **Information and Planning Assistance** Assistance in providing Hamas with sensitive information and aiding in the planning of the operation, though this assistance was unlikely to be significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Training by Wagner PMC** Instructors from the Wagner PMC are said to have conducted combat and tactical training for Hamas fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. It is explicitly stated that these were Wagner instructors, not servicemen of the Russian army or Main Directorate of the former Russian General Staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Weapon Supply and False Flag** Hamas allegedly received weapons, possibly from Russia's "Rona" through the Wagner PMC, with the intention of demonstrating Ukrainian involvement via leaked weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Russian Motivations
Two primary reasons are posited for Russia's alleged involvement:
1.  **Opening a Second Front** To divert Western attention away from Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
2.  **Personal Revenge** Allegedly, Putin decided to take revenge on Israel after Israeli doctors, who had supervised his cancer treatment since 2020 and performed surgery in February, stated in March-April that they would no longer be involved in his treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

It is cautioned that Russia's participation in the Hamas operation should not be overstated, as it was mainly carried out with the active participation and patronage of international terrorist networks and Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

## Impact on the [[Russia Ukraine conflict | Russia-Ukraine Conflict]]

### Shift in Global Media Attention
The emergence of the conflict in the Middle East has notably shifted global media attention away from Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. By October 6-7, American and other major global media outlets curtailed their online coverage of military actions in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. For example, the BBC news hour on a Saturday morning reportedly had no mention of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

> "Where attention is directed, there energy appears. If there is no attention, then there is no energy." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>
This maxim is considered applicable to the situation around [[russianukrainian_relations_and_military_tensions | Russian-Ukrainian relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. It is difficult to imagine the conditions under which Ukraine will return to the long-term focus of global media attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Global media outlets are crucial as they formulate the information agenda and determine what is at the center of societies' attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Implications for Western Aid
While financial resources are deemed sufficient for the US to aid both Israel and Ukraine simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, the situation regarding weapons and ammunition is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This becomes a question of prioritizing who receives aid first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The longer the Middle East war lasts, the more acute the problem of choosing priorities for weapon and ammunition supplies will become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

Western aid to Ukraine reportedly peaked in the summer and early autumn of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a> and is now expected to decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. One reason for this is the new theater of military operations in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

### Status of the [[Ukraine Russia conflict analysis | Ukrainian Offensive]] and [[Military and strategic implications in Russia Ukraine conflict | Russian Counteroffensive]]
Another significant reason for the expected decrease in aid is the assessment that the [[ukraine_russia_conflict_analysis | Ukrainian offensive]] was unable to achieve its strategic goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Although there have been positional successes, strategic objectives have not been met and are unlikely to be achieved this season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. The summer-autumn offensive campaign is considered to be in its final phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

Meanwhile, Russian attempts to seize the initiative and organize a counteroffensive in the directions of Avdiivka and Kupyansk are described as "not very impressive" and "impressive in their senselessness and losses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

The most probable outcome for the summer-autumn campaigns is seen as the transition of both parties to mutual strategic defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This situation is characterized by Western experts as a stalemate or strategic dead end, a condition that has been predicted for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. While military action is unpredictable, the current observation points to this stalemate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Russian Leadership's Priorities
A strategic dead end is unlikely to benefit Ukraine, but for the Russian side, preserving the status quo through strategic defense may be satisfactory to its leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. The primary focus for the Russian military-political leadership has shifted to the internal situation, specifically resolving the issue of Supreme Authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This is distinguished from presidential elections, which are considered a mere formality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

It is asserted that the current president, Vladimir Putin, is living out his "last days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a> and is being successfully replaced by a double or two for international visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This includes a reported trip to Beijing, where the Chinese side is aware they are dealing with a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. The elite around the president, particularly a coalition led by Nikolai Patrushev, is said to hold the main trump cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

The departure of the president is expected to lead to the destruction of the system he created and moderated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>, resulting in significant turbulence in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. This period is expected to bring many "amazing unexpected events, twists and strange very strange phenomena, strange faces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

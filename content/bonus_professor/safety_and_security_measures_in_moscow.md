Moscow has recently experienced heightened security concerns, prompting various measures and reactions from authorities and the public. The overall atmosphere in Russia is described as "intensive and increasingly intense tense hysterical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, particularly affecting the [[russian_societal_concerns_and_priorities | Russian establishment]] and some "mentally unstable layers of Russian society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Drone Attacks and Public Response
On the night of May 2-3, 2023, the Moscow Kremlin was attacked by drones of unknown origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The Kremlin's quick public recognition of this fact was seen as an admission that "things are not going very well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The attack was symbolic, aiming to show that the Kremlin is "vulnerable" and "accessible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

Drones have been regularly attacking not only frontline areas but increasingly flying into the "very heart of the Russian capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> and the Moscow region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This has led to a "mania for searching and detecting Ukrainian drones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a> in Moscow and the Moscow region, with up to 100 calls received in one day from eyewitnesses reporting drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. The overwhelming majority of these calls are considered "absolute nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, likely dictated by the fears of those reporting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Implemented Measures
*   **Airspace Monitoring**: Moscow authorities have ordered public utilities to monitor the airspace of the Russian capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This involves utility workers, dressed in red vests, standing on high-rise buildings and manually looking and listening for drones without optical devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This order indicates "strong nervousness" and "strong tension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Drone Ban**: On May 3, 2023, the Moscow mayor banned all drone launches in Moscow, except for "competent ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Calls for [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | Martial Law]]
Following the drone attack, [[role_of_security_forces_in_russian_politics | Secretary of the Security Council]] Patrushev "demanded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a> the president to immediately impose [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Martial law is already in effect in the so-called "new territories" or "new regions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The proposal was to extend it to the Russian capital, frontline regions, and potentially other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

President Putin postponed the decision, not wanting to make hasty decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, and it is believed nothing will be decided before May 9, 2023, due to Victory Day parade plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Putin is hesitant to impose [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] as it would diminish his power in favor of [[role_of_security_forces_in_russian_politics | security officers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### Implications of [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | Martial Law]]
If [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] or its elements are introduced, it would entail a "set of restrictions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>:
*   **Restriction of Civil Rights and Freedoms**: Especially for those subject to military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Travel Ban**: Individuals subject to military service (over 15 million people currently in the database <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>) could be banned from traveling outside the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Movement Restrictions**: Restrictions on movement between regions and strengthened passport control could be introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Freedom of Speech**: Restriction of freedom of speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Internment**: The possibility of internment, meaning detention without trial or investigation for up to 30 days, which can be extended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Conscription**: Conscription would become much easier to carry out, with existing formal restrictions likely ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Mass checks of conscripts and military service-liable individuals are already starting in some cities outside Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Financial Restrictions**: Bank cards and accounts of those potentially subject to mobilization could be blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The Central Bank has reportedly prepared for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

The actual implementation of [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] or its elements would depend significantly on the position of local authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Moscow Mayor Sobyanin is expected to try and protect Moscow citizens to the best of his ability to maintain their loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

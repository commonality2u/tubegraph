Valery Solovey's program, "What Happens," discussed the role and perception of Russian leadership and power structures at the end of 2022 and heading into 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The political climate was framed as one of severe trials and military action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Leadership's Vision for 2023

President Vladimir Putin's New Year's address was described as a "parting word for military action," predicting 2023 would be a year of "severe trials" and "military action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The speaker characterized Putin's appearance during the address as having a "face distorted with pain and hatred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Legislative and Enforcement Power Structures

Actions taken by the State Duma support the president's predictions. A bill was passed in its third reading on the eve of the New Year, making it legally proper to serve mobilization summonses by registered mail with notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This means that if a notice for a registered letter from the post office is received, the summons will be considered handed over upon receipt of the letter, even if it's not opened or is refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Perception of Russian Society and Leadership

### Intellectual Weakness and Lack of Imagination
Yuri Andropov's quote, "we do not know the Society in which we live," is applied to modern Russian society, suggesting a fundamental misunderstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This misunderstanding stems from two factors:
*   **Falsification of Data** – The speaker noted that official sociology and statistics are inaccurate and outright falsified, to the extent that even the "supreme leadership of Russia" could not obtain reliable data on voting preferences in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Intellectual Weakness** – The intellectual class, including those professionally engaged in analysis, are often unable to understand what is "literally before our eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The "Putin system" has always been "in plain sight," yet many failed to comprehend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This intellectual weakness is also linked to poor historical knowledge and a "very weak imagination," hindering the ability to foresee radical changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

The [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | political class]] is deemed "not able to imagine another Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. The speaker emphasized that a lack of imagination leads to limitations in knowledge, citing the example of Saxobank's "incredible" forecasts which, though rarely true, expand intellectual frameworks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

### The Nature of Russian Power
The [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | ruling class]] itself cannot "imagine the true nature of Russian power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. An example of this is Dmitry Anatolyevich Medvedev's repeated trips to Kathmandu in the two months prior to the New Year, ostensibly to find an entrance to the mythical Shambhala <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. These "at least 3rd attempt[s]" to find Shambhala involved "tens of millions of dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This anecdote is presented as an illustration of the "true nature of Russian power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### Societal Adaptability and Moralism
Russian society is characterized as "very flexible and highly adaptive," which allows it to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. However, this is also seen as a weakness, as it "very quickly historically instantly gets used to the bad" and "begins to endure the unbearable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

The speaker notes the "moralism" of society, which he defines as "Beyond good and evil," echoing Nietzsche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. While Russians are "very capable," they are often "not capable of conducting entertainment between good and evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. This makes them susceptible to being led "with equal success and a goat and to good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. A Chinese phrase, "people grass rulers wind," is used to illustrate that "wherever the wind blows there our people will go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.

### Mental State of Society
The mental state of Russian society is contradictory, displaying "deep depression and apathy" alongside "agitation and high readiness for aggression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>. However, there is also a "deep need to return to normal," indicating a recognition that the current state is "deeply abnormal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. It is suggested that after emotions and aggression are "splashed out on a global scale," society could move in a "direction directly opposite to the current" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

## Stability of Power Structures
The speaker asserted that "final stability was ensured last year" in Russia, largely due to the "competent efforts by senior government officials, bureaucrats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. While these "competent, qualified" personnel exist, the speaker lamented that they "serve evil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:20">[00:21:20]</a>. This conformity extends to officials, who are "no different from the average Russian" in their conformism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. However, there is a possibility that these individuals could "begin to serve a good cause" or "go over to the right side of history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

Regarding the financial system, despite contrasting forecasts from economists, the speaker believes the outcome depends on "political factors" interfering with economic processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. The chances of these [[impact_of_leadership_changes_on_russian_political_climate | political factors]] having a "destructive" influence are considered "much much higher" in 2023 than in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.

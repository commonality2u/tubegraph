Moscow's future, as presented by Valery Solovey, is deeply intertwined with ongoing military developments and the evolving dynamics of international relations, particularly with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The internal political landscape also shows signs of significant shifts and struggles, contributing to an uncertain future for the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Current Military Standoff and Strategic Intentions

The "winter offensive" of the Russian army has reportedly come to an "inglorious end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, with the bloody storming of Bakhmut being the only point of contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner PMC, has openly complained about shell shortages and high losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Other experts, including Igor Strelkov, also stated that the winter campaign ended "without result" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

It is suggested that the "grand offensive" was more of an imitation, designed to placate the supreme commander-in-chief and give the appearance of progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This imitation served to preserve equipment and ammunition, and to retain the professional army, in anticipation of a Ukrainian counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. General Gerasimov is believed to be preparing for this counteroffensive by constructing a strong defensive line, which was previously called the "Surovikino line" and will now likely be known as the "Gerasimov line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The strategy aims to wear down Ukrainian forces, leading to a transactional position where negotiations could begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## China's Influence and Putin's Hopes

Vladimir Putin, as the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Armed Forces and President, is reportedly relying on China, his "older brother," for support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Efforts were made to secure a visit from Comrade Xi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. For Putin, a symbolic win of a visit from a superpower leader is crucial, showing that Russia is still "in business" and he is not in international isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. A more practical hope is to secure weapons and ammunition from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

However, China has not yet supplied military products to Russia, causing frustration within the Russian political leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. China's primary interest is for Russia to become a sphere of its influence, which is achievable only if Russia is sufficiently weakened during the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Supplying arms to Russia would further antagonize China's relations with the United States, which China wishes to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Putin as a "Toxic Asset"

There are "deaf but well-founded rumors" that China views Vladimir Putin as a "toxic asset for Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. China believes the Russian leadership needs "personnel renewal" because Putin has led Russia into a practically hopeless situation and cannot achieve victory or agree to peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. China now reportedly doubts that Putin is a guarantor of Russia's stability and capable of observing China's interests in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. There are likely individuals ready to promise China that they would better observe stability and China's interests than Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. These developments highlight potential [[future_political_changes_and_developments_in_russia | future political changes]] driven by international relations.

## Internal Political Struggles and Cleansing

Symptoms of an internal political struggle are emerging within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Evgeny Prigozhin, who had considerable ambitions, is being deprived of his main asset: the armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Health-Related Incidents
There are reports of health problems affecting high-ranking leaders:
*   A leader of one of the North Caucasian republics was "most likely poisoned," or his "health was exposed to external influence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   The health of at least two to three other high-ranking leaders has reportedly been exposed to similar external influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   The urgent medical evacuation of a famous cellist to Germany is also cited as potentially related to these "invisible symptoms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

These incidents suggest a "cleansing of the political field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a> and point to an ongoing "operation" to prepare the stage for future political shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### Opposition's Mutual Exposure
A widely discussed topic is the internal conflict among the Russian opposition, particularly between Navalny's team (Volkov) and A. Venediktov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. The speaker criticizes this "mutual exposure" and infighting, drawing parallels to communists who hated each other more than the bourgeoisie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

> "If communists hated the bourgeoisie as much as they hate each other, they would have long ago carried out a world revolution." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>

This conflict benefits the Second Service of the FSB and the Presidential Administration, allowing the current government to watch the opposition "drown each other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. The opposition and Russian society are the clear losers, as it makes society question the opposition's effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>.

## Societal Impact and Future Outlook

A concerning trend is the significant decrease in the life expectancy of Russian men, dropping by almost 5 years to 64.2 years between 2019-2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. This means that, on average, Russian men do not even live to the new retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. This is presented as an "apotheosis of Putin's economic and social policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>. The speaker promises that a new government, upon coming to power, would reduce the retirement age and provide compensation for unreceived pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

The year 2023 is anticipated to be a "decisive year" for Russia, with a potential "breakthrough" for freedom, dignity, and well-being, contrasting with any promises made by Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. This emphasizes the expectation of significant [[future_predictions_and_societal_impact | future predictions and societal impact]] in Russia.

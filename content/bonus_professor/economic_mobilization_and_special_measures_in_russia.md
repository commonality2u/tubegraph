Russia is transitioning towards a [[hidden_mobilization_and_economic_impact_in_russia | mobilization model of its economy]], characterized by the government's increasing control over enterprises and labor [07:56]. This shift is being implemented through draft amendments to federal law, proposed by the government to the State Duma [07:45].

## Special Economic Measures

The proposed amendments grant authorities the right to introduce "special measures in the sphere of the economy" [08:03]. This means that firms, organizations, and enterprises, regardless of their form of ownership, will be prohibited from refusing government orders and contracts related to the Russian Federation's armed actions outside Russia [08:12]. Businesses will be legally obligated to supply goods, perform work, and provide services for military operations abroad [08:53].

Furthermore, these special measures allow Russian authorities to change the terms of contracts during their implementation and to interfere with labor relations within organizations [09:04].

## Impact on Labor

Under these new measures, employees can be compelled to work at night, on weekends, and during holidays, with the possibility of vacations being canceled [09:32]. This approach echoes the Soviet Union's economic state on the eve of June 1941 [09:58].

## Strategic Trap and Degradation

This increasing economic control and [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] effort is described as drawing the Kremlin into a strategic trap [10:06]. The continuous escalation of efforts to overcome resistance from Ukraine and the international community leads to the depletion of Russia's material, human (anthropological), and moral-psychological resources [10:42]. This path is seen as a rollback, leading to social, technological, and economic degradation [11:15].

## Implications for Private Investors

The state's increasing control also extends to the private sector. An example of this is Gazprom's refusal to pay dividends, marking the first time since 1998 [20:04]. This action, reportedly on direct orders from the state, signals to private investors that they are viewed as "freeloaders" and that their investments are not truly their own [20:23]. As the regime enters a state of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization economy]], expect further restrictions, harshness, simplification, and pressure [20:47].

The use of body doubles, or "deuces" in the professional jargon of the Federal Security Service and Presidential Security Service, can serve to conceal high-profile events in political leadership, such as a leader's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Case Study: [[Putins leadership and political influence | Vladimir Putin]]

It is suggested that the death of [[Putins leadership and political influence | Vladimir Putin]] was easier to conceal because he had been "very successfully replaced by a double" for two to three months prior to his alleged passing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This tactic is reportedly used by [[attempts_to_hide_highprofile_political_deaths_in_authoritarian_regimes | authoritarian regimes]] to manage transitions of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Purpose and Duration of Double Use
The "deuce" can be employed for a short period to "cover up the transition to post-puncture" or to facilitate what is termed "[[Putins doubles and their future | Putin's]] future without [[Putins leadership and political influence | Putin]] himself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. While the double's use is meant to be temporary, it is currently suggested that such a double could be used for a maximum of "d-t months" (phonetically "2-3 months") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The limitations on the double's long-term effectiveness imply that this is not a sustainable solution for permanent leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This strategy forms part of the [[role_and_influence_of_putins_doubles | role and influence of Putin's doubles]] in current [[role_and_perception_of_russian_leadership_and_power_structures | Russian leadership and power structures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

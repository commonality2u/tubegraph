Russia's foreign policy strategy with Europe aims to achieve specific tactical and operational goals, primarily by dividing European countries and influencing their decision-making processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Core Strategy: Divide and Influence
The Kremlin actively attempts to [[Kremlins diplomatic strategies with Ukraine and the West | split "old Europe"]] from "new Europe," and both from the "Anglo-Saxon bloc" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Old Europe** is primarily identified as Germany, France, and Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **New Europe** is seen as having Poland as its hegemon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   The **Anglo-Saxon bloc** refers to the alliance between Great Britain and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Methods of Influence

### Incriminating Materials and Blackmail
Moscow is believed to possess "dirt" on numerous European politicians, which are used to influence their decision-making processes and the foreign policy development of their countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. A Bulgarian investigator, Christa Gruzil, reportedly promised to publish names of 600 European politicians who received support from the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Another form of blackmail involves economic and demographic threats:
*   **Refugee Crisis:** Moscow warns that continued conflict will lead to more Ukrainian refugees in Europe, increasing the burden on national budgets and social services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Global Famine:** Russia suggests that current European policy could trigger a global famine, causing an influx of refugees from North Africa and the Middle East into Europe, particularly Italy, Germany, and France <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This tactic leverages the memory of the 2015-2018 migration crisis, which remains a significant concern for European governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Activating Agents of Influence
The Kremlin seeks to activate individuals connected with Russia, not necessarily those receiving money, but "sincere idiots" who act as "agents of influence" in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Henry Kissinger's statement advocating negotiations between Ukraine and Russia is seen as indicative of this strategy, as his pragmatic approach aligns with [[Russian foreign policy and military strategy | Russian foreign policy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Diplomatic Engagement
A conversation between Putin, Scholz, and Macron occurred in late May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. An unauthorized leak from this conversation indicated Russia's readiness for "peace," demanding the lifting of sanctions in exchange for food supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Defining "Peace" from Moscow's Perspective
When Moscow speaks of "peace," it signifies a truce or ceasefire, which is highly beneficial for the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This "peace" allows Russia time to:
*   Regroup forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   Bring up new contingents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   Scrape together military equipment, as resources are becoming depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

The Kremlin is categorically not interested in returning troops to their pre-February 24th positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. For Ukraine, accepting such a "peace" would mean legitimizing a new territorial status quo that benefits Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Russia is preparing to integrate these new territories into its composition, potentially through referendums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Exhaustion of Resources
The issue of resource exhaustion is visible in Russia, as evidenced by:
*   The abolition of the age limit for signing first military contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   The de-mothballing of outdated T-62 tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   Alleged forced recruitment efforts targeting young people in Dagestan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

## Influence of Leader's Health
Western media publications about the Russian president's poor health are perceived as a deliberate information operation by Western special services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>. The objective is to influence the Russian establishment and elite, signaling that the president is no longer a guarantor of the system and his promises should not be relied upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. This strategy, similar to previous operations that leaked information about Russian military buildup against Ukraine, aims to create nervousness and disrupt planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

Valery Solovey hosts a program addressing pressing questions, including those concerning [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russia's internal political dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This episode, the 14th of the series, responds to questions posted by viewers on YouTube on March 20, with answers released on March 23 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Solovey prioritizes the most popular questions (based on likes and repetition) and those he deems most relevant or humorous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Impact of Xi Jinping's Visit

A significant portion of questions revolved around Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
The visit was largely advantageous for China but unsuccessful and unhelpful for the Russian Federation, proving particularly disappointing for President Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Benefits for China
China secured:
*   Cheap gas at a substantial discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   An obligation for Russia to build a new gas pipeline at Russia's expense, supplying gas at a colossal discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   Russia's commitments to all investment projects and consent to all economic requests China was interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   A shift where Russia will pay in yuan for trade with Latin America and Asia. This move, beneficial exclusively to China, expands the yuan's global appeal and ties Russia more closely to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Outcomes for Russia
In return, the Russian Federation received "beautiful, high-flown, flowery oriental formulas" emphasizing Russia and China as reliable partners jointly resisting attempts to disrupt modern peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Putin was particularly disheartened that China did not even promise to supply lethal military equipment, though non-lethal goods are already supplied and will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Russia's urgent need for military equipment to repel an anticipated Ukrainian counteroffensive was met with "friendly reprimands" and affectionate pats from China, a gesture typically reserved for a dominant party to a subordinate one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

China vaguely indicated a readiness to revisit the issue of lethal weapons in the summer, likely waiting to observe the results of the Ukrainian counteroffensive to avoid worsening relations with the United States if Russian armament proves ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

Solovey states that Russia is "spinning like in a frying pan," no longer speaking of multipolarity, and is turning into a vassal state to China, which Putin intends to make Russia's suzerain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. He emphasizes that this is an ongoing process, far from completion, and expresses confidence that it will be reversed when new powers come into play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## [[russian_domestic_political_situation | Russian Domestic Political Situation]] and Future Leadership
The Chinese are indifferent to [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russian domestic political dynamics]], caring only that Russia fulfills its obligations to China and remains politically stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. The meeting in an expanded format, including Prime Minister Mishustin, was described as a "bride show" for Xi Jinping, who seemed pleased and invited Mishustin (the "bride") to visit China with the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

However, Solovey believes that Xi Jinping made a significant mistake in February of the previous year by consenting to Putin's assurance of a "lightning-fast" and "large-scale military operation" that would lead to "triumphant success" in a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Nuclear Rhetoric
Nuclear rhetoric has subsided, but the "dog" (Russia) is still ready to bite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Putin reportedly motivated the need for Chinese weapons by stating that Russia "cannot lose," and if it cannot, it will have no choice but to use tactical nuclear weapons in the event of a successful Ukrainian counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

## Potential Future Changes

### Post-Putin Era
Solovey anticipates significant, deep, and large-scale political upheavals in Russia after Putin's rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. He believes that the next president will be a completely different person from any current candidates mentioned in the government or opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:07">[00:36:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>.

### Governance and Reforms
*   **Constituent Assembly:** A constituent assembly or constitutional conference is expected to establish a new Russian Republic and adopt a new constitution, which will also consider the issue of the coat of arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Lenin's Burial:** Solovey suggests that Lenin and all those buried in the Kremlin wall should be buried in one cemetery for Soviet and post-Soviet statesmen, with Lenin receiving state honors, to put an end to this historical narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Pension Reform:** A pension reform is considered absolutely necessary, where each citizen would have a special pension account, and if a person dies before retirement age, their savings would be transferred to relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:14">[00:20:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:34">[00:20:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
*   **Federalism:** Solovey supports Russia becoming a true federation, where regions and republics have expanded financial and economic powers, and all regions are equal in rights and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:29">[00:32:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:47">[00:32:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:18">[00:33:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:26">[00:33:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:36">[00:33:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>.
*   **Russian Orthodox Church:** The speaker and his colleagues support the separation of church and state, allowing the church to determine its own patriarch. They anticipate that political changes in Russia will significantly impact the Orthodox Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:54">[00:33:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:06">[00:34:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.
*   **Scientific Sphere:** The Russian Academy of Sciences is reportedly decomposing, and the scientific system is degrading overall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:24">[00:37:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:23">[00:38:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:24">[00:38:24]</a>.

## Current State of Affairs

### Public Support and Repression
*   **Popular Support:** While official sociological institutes overstate it, support for the current power within the Russian Federation's population is significant, exceeding half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:58">[00:30:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.
*   **Repressions:** Repressions against dissenters, and even those who outwardly agree but subtly hint at independent opinions, are expected to intensify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:24">[00:31:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:29">[00:31:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:31">[00:31:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:36">[00:31:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:39">[00:31:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>. This intensification is not directly linked to the International Criminal Court's arrest warrant for Putin, but the warrant may lead to increased surveillance and control over Russian elites, including oligarchs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:58">[00:31:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>.
*   **Blogger Detention:** Recent detentions of popular bloggers, disguised as tax evasion cases similar to Al Capone's imprisonment, are viewed as a "purge" by a fearful power group to send a signal to other public opinion leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:39">[00:23:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:11">[00:24:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.

### Economic Conditions
The Russian stock market is described as insignificant and closed, with fluctuations driven by small financial speculation rather than reflecting significant future economic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:23">[00:36:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:27">[00:36:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">[00:36:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:47">[00:36:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:09">[00:37:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:16">[00:37:16]</a>. Economic conditions are generally worsening for everyone in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:49">[00:40:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>.

## Opposition and Political Movements

### Unity and Challenges
Opposition forces are currently characterized by infighting and disunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. While some consolidation is occurring within [[russian_political_dynamics_amidst_leadership_changes | Russian political emigration]], particularly among liberal democrats, Navalny's team largely maintains an independent stance, believing they hold a leadership position within the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

### Future Coalitions
Solovey asserts that no real political consolidation can happen in Russia now due to an outright ban on political and civic activity, including parts of charity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>. However, in the long term, he considers it highly probable that an anti-regime coalition will emerge, potentially including democrats, leftists, and even Russian nationalists, similar to the "Democratic Russia" anti-communist front of the late 1980s and early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. He anticipates a period of lustration (purging of officials) in Russia, particularly for the judiciary, with a new era similar to 1985-1999, but in its best manifestations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:18">[00:28:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:25">[00:28:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>.

### Allegations and Observations
*   **Putin's Legitimacy:** Despite corruption, questionable ascension to power, and a Hague International Criminal Court warrant, Putin is considered the legitimate president of the Russian Federation, recognized by its populace through elections (though directed and uncontested) and by the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.
*   **Putin's Doubles:** There are reportedly at least two doubles of Putin, specially selected without relatives or social ties, who were initially very similar in appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:47">[00:29:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>.
*   **Occult Involvement:** Putin consistently participates in occult events but was unable to perform a traditional ritual with elders on the day of the vernal equinox due to Xi Jinping's visit, which reportedly upset him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a>.
*   **Anti-Semitism:** Solovey sees no reason for an outbreak of anti-Semitism in Russia after Putin's departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
*   **Financial Aid to Solovey's Movement:** Solovey emphasizes that financial support for his movement is an investment in a better, free, fair, and prosperous Russia for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:18">[00:40:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:21">[00:40:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:03">[00:41:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. He highlights that they do not seek money from oligarchs, as they are with the people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:16">[00:41:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:19">[00:41:19]</a>.

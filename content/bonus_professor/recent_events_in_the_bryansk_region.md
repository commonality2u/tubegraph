On March 6, 2023, attention was drawn to events unfolding in the Bryansk region of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The situation was initially characterized by conflicting and mutually exclusive information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, leading to the postponement of a Security Council meeting from Thursday to Friday due to the contradictory data even for the President of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Nature of the Event

The event was described as a raid by a group identifying as the "Russian volunteer corps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The speaker expressed skepticism about the organization's existence, noting that "no one knows its existence yet except for this event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The primary purpose of this "flight" was to "show the flag" and "demonstrate its own existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. It was considered a "symbolic political" act rather than a military one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Symbolic Significance

The symbolic background of this event was an attempt to demonstrate that the [[russian_military_operations_in_ukraine | armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine]] would be transferred to Russian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, carried out by Russian volunteers fighting on the side of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This event is unlikely to gain support from the broader Russian public, especially as it involved "killing people and shelling civilians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Leadership's Response and Concerns

The event did not appear to frighten the Russian President or the Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Their primary concern was the presence of Russian nationalism itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. An expert, Dmitry Demushkin, suggested that this incident might serve as a pretext for a purge of Russian nationalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, even though no formal nationalist organizations exist in Russia, only subcultures and informal groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This purge is anticipated in the context of an upcoming serious [[change_in_the_political_landscape_in_russia | political crisis]] in Russia, as security officers are beginning to preemptively protect against potential participants in this crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

The events in the Bryansk region highlighted the defenselessness of the population in border regions against sabotage groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. However, the Russian leadership, particularly President Putin, is primarily concerned with their own security, leaving the protection of these territories to local governors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The Bryansk raid, along with a mass drone attack on February 28 (which Ukraine denied authorship of) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, demonstrated that the territory of the Russian Federation, including protected objects, is "touchable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This revelation plays an important role in the nature of decisions being made by the leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

The incident occurred just before an anticipated FSB Collegium meeting on February 28, which was expected to initiate significant personnel changes within law enforcement agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. However, no changes occurred, as President Putin decided "not to change horses during the crossing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This lack of action, particularly not holding the FSB responsible for the Bryansk incident, has caused strong irritation among FSB employees, who now characterize the Supreme Commander-in-Chief as "impotent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. They believe he made "tragic mistakes" that led Russia into a "dead end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

Valery Solovey, in the 16th episode of "What is happening," addresses what he describes as an impending "threatening catastrophe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This catastrophe is not political or international, but exclusively concerns [[socioeconomic_conditions_in_russia | internal Russian socioeconomic problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Solovey suggests that these [[economic_challenges_and_consumer_behavior_in_russia | problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a> are becoming "insoluble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> for Russian society and the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Food Crisis and Rationing

The introduction of food cards, which Solovey has regularly discussed for months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, has been met with skepticism but is now becoming a reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. He views their appearance as a "sign of something very bad, very difficult happening in the Russian economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

*   **Implementation**: Food or social cards are set to be introduced in the Kaliningrad region after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The head of the State Duma for financial markets, Aksakov, proposed extending them across all of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. They have already been partially introduced for certain items in other cities, notably Kamchatka <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, a fish region where cards for fish are being introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: In theory, these cards provide an opportunity for socially disadvantaged populations, especially pensioners whose income is below the subsistence minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Quality and Cost**: Unlike food stamps in the United States, which provide free, normal-quality provisions to 41.5 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, Russian cards require users to *buy* food at "social prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The quality of these products is expected to be poor, described as "awful fish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a> where meat falls off bones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, or "illiquid goods" that need to be dumped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This system is seen as a way to dispose of unsellable stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Cause**: The introduction of cards is attributed to serious crop failures in the Russian Federation, the most severe in over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The most acute shortage of provisions is expected in the Trans-Urals and Siberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Historical Parallels**: Solovey draws parallels to the Perestroika era in Soviet Russia, where shelves were often empty except for low-quality products like squash caviar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. He predicts that the card system will eventually extend to the entire country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a> and that people will receive "sandwiches from this very substance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Housing Market Collapse

The housing market is identified as another critical area of concern, typically a strong indicator of economic health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Currently, the situation for Russian developers is described as "pre-catastrophic" and soon to be "catastrophic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

*   **Debt and Key Rate**: The construction industry leads all sectors in debt growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. This is attributed to the Central Bank's rising key rate, which is projected to reach 23% this month (from 21%) and then jump to 35% at the beginning of next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   **Unsold Housing**: Construction companies cannot repay loans and are struggling to sell built housing, with approximately 60% of new apartments remaining unsold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Consequences**: This portends a collapse of the construction market, leading to bankruptcies, particularly among small and medium-sized companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. Large developers like Pika are expected to survive by reducing their workforce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. One owner of "Airplane," a major Moscow developer, is urgently trying to sell his share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Impact on Buyers**: Those who bought apartments at the excavation stage or with existing structures face a "real prospect" of becoming "unfortunate developers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, struggling for years or even decades to get their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
*   **Housing Prices**: Prices may initially drop as developers try to offload unsold units but are expected to rise later due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

## Soaring Inflation

Inflation is a significant concern. According to unofficial data, cumulative inflation for 2022-2023 has caused prices to almost double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. For the upcoming year, inflation growth is projected to be between 100% and 200% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. The ruble exchange rate against the dollar and euro is expected to continue depreciating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

## Potential Freezing of Deposits

A serious concern is the discussion of various scenarios for freezing deposits, with the "Cypriot scenario" being the most intensively discussed and having the highest chance of implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

*   **Mechanism**: Under this scenario, all funds exceeding the insured amount of 1,400,000 rubles would be converted into bank shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. These shares would then be frozen, preventing their sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
*   **Impact**: While the majority of depositors (97.5% as of recently) would not be affected as their deposits are below 1,400,000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>, those with larger deposits would suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Deposits over 10 million rubles account for almost a third of total deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. Even the insured amount would likely be subject to limits on cash withdrawals and non-cash payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:26">[00:18:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.
*   **Government Expectation**: The state expects a neutral or even approving reaction from society, as many would view it as "the rich suffer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

## Government's Response and Historical Parallels

The current Russian authorities intend to cope with the impending [[economic_challenges_in_russia_and_governmental_strategies | economic catastrophe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a> using "Old Soviet, even Bolshevik patterns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>. This includes:
*   Deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>
*   Food cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>
*   Special distributors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>
*   "Honest" (in quotes) taking money from the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>

Solovey states that the government will continue to extract Russia from the crisis "at the expense of society, at the expense of the people, spitting on it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. An "elite consensus" supports these measures as "absolutely necessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

## Advice for Citizens

Acknowledging that many feel it is "too late" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a> and dependent on the authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>, Solovey offers several recommendations for citizens to cope with the impending crisis:
*   **Create Social Networks of Mutual Aid**: Establish local networks for mutual assistance with others facing similar problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. This could involve tasks like taking turns queuing for social products, reminiscent of the Soviet era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
*   **Support the Elderly**: People of middle and younger ages should prioritize helping their elderly parents and other seniors, who will be disproportionately affected by the crisis, especially the food shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. He suggests regularly talking to them, visiting them, and finding out their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
*   **Prepare for Difficult Times**: Citizens should prepare for "very difficult times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>, recognizing that while Russia will overcome these challenges, the cost will be high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

Valery Soloviev, a doctor of historical sciences, political analyst, and public figure, discussed the potential for [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] and [[russia_moving_toward_martial_law | martial law]] in Russia during his March 4, 2022, program, "What is Happening Today." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> He noted that the news was "bad and very bad," reflecting a dynamically developing situation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>

## Rising Rumors and Official Denials

There are "creeping rumors about mass [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] and possibly the introduction of [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law | martial law]]" in Russia. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a> These rumors are "about rumors about gossip" that the Russian president's press secretary, Peskov, is attempting to discredit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a> However, Soloviev reminds listeners that Peskov had previously denied that any military actions would be taken against Ukraine just "ten days [or] two weeks ago." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a> Therefore, his current denials should be treated as "nonsense." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>

## Arguments for Mobilization

From a logical standpoint, several factors favor the decision for [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]]:

*   **Deployed Forces** The Pentagon's data, as reported in American media, indicates that Russia has already deployed 90% of its armed forces assembled for the "special operation" in Ukraine. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a> Military objectives remain unsolved, suggesting a need for more personnel. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>
*   **Unemployment Solution** [[mobilization_and_the_state_of_the_russian_army | Mobilization]] could address rising unemployment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a> For example, if the Volkswagen plant closes, displacing 5,000 workers, these individuals could "well be found a place in the active army," receiving "decent money." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>
*   **Expanded Scope of Operations** If the "scope of the special operation" is to be expanded beyond Ukraine, as previous plans suggested, then a larger army would be necessary. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>

## Argument Against Mobilization

The primary factor against [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] is the "possibility of political discontent," specifically "mass political discontent," which the authorities would want to avoid. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>

## Link Between Mobilization and Martial Law

If a [[renewed_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] were to occur, especially on a significant scale (e.g., half a million people), it would "most likely... go hand in hand with the vision of [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law | martial law]], full or partial." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a> This could also manifest as the "introduction of elements of [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law | martial law]] without declaring [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law | martial law]]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>

## De Facto Martial Law Elements

Elements of [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law | martial law]] are already "partially introduced in the Russian Federation" de facto, without legal justification. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>

*   **Censorship:** The introduction of censorship is seen as an "element of [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law | martial law]]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a> A new law makes it unclear how to discuss events in Ukraine, as "any phrase can be regarded as empty" or "any information can potentially be regarded" as false if desired. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> Amendments to the administrative code may even prohibit terms like "anti-war movement." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>
*   **Property Seizure:** If [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law | martial law]] is introduced, military authorities gain the right to seize private "property and... equipment for their own needs." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a> This indicates that the "right of private property," which was "rather nominal in nature," could be "massively violated." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>

## Perceived Public Support and Nuclear Threat

Pro-government sociological agencies claim that 70% of the population supports the Kremlin's operation in Ukraine, which the Kremlin interprets as a "carte blanche for its actions." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a> Soloviev expresses doubt about these figures, believing the situation is "far from being so rosy." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>

This perceived support allows for potentially "gloomy" actions, including threats of nuclear weapons. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a> The speaker notes that the world is in a situation "close to the Cuban Missile Crisis." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a> Russian officials, including Peskov, stated that economic sanctions would be perceived as "a declaration of war." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a> Given that the West is now openly waging an "economic war" against the Russian Federation, inflicting "extremely prolonged blows" on the Russian economy and society, the Kremlin views threatening with or even demonstrating tactical nuclear weapons as a way to "achieve significant concessions." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>

## Implications and Warnings

Soloviev warns that previous predictions, such as the decision for war with Ukraine and 2022 being "the hardest year" for Russia, have come true. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a> He states that "what has come true is just the beginning," and "the best is yet to come." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a> He urges listeners to consider the future implications:
*   Their sons, husbands, and fathers being called to "pay their debt to the motherland." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>
*   Lack of vital medications in pharmacies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>
*   Inability to access medical procedures like MRIs due to technical impossibilities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:16">[00:18:16]</a>
*   Difficulty in buying even the simplest food. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>

Soloviev stresses that "you can't get out of hell alone," and encourages strengthening "horizontal connections" and mutual aid. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a> While current information suggests a minority opposes the government, he believes that "in just a few months," the majority will be in favor of peace, as "life is better than any explanations [and] changes even the most stubborn deluded and stubborn." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>

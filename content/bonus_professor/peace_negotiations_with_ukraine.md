The confrontation between Russia and Ukraine could conclude by the end of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. It is believed that by this time, there is a possibility of entering into [[potential_peace_negotiations_involving_russia_and_ukraine | peace negotiations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Prospects for Peace

The speaker hopes that the conflict can end by the end of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The nature of these [[potential_peace_negotiations_involving_russia_and_ukraine | peace negotiations]] is not predetermined, and they might even be a truce rather than a full peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. The phrase "a bad peace is better than a good quarrel" is used to describe the current situation, which has been "very drawn out" and has led to "colossal, incalculable losses" for both countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

Preliminary agreement exists between the warring parties to enter into [[potential_peace_negotiations_involving_russia_and_the_ukraine | negotiations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. However, there is no current agreement on a peace formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The [[potential_peace_negotiations_involving_russia_and_the_ukraine | negotiations]] are expected to be completed, most likely, by the fall or at least by the end of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Conditions for Negotiations

It is noted that Ukrainian officials, including Zelensky, reflect the will of the Ukrainian people, who, according to recent polls, would not agree to a peace formula exchanging peace for territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. However, it is suggested that if the Ukrainian people are "deprived of Western military support," they would "immediately go to [[potential_peace_negotiations_involving_russia_and_ukraine | negotiations]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. The speaker states that "necessity breaks any ambitions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.

Things are currently moving towards the beginning of [[prospects_of_peace_between_ukraine_and_russia | peace negotiations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Both the Russian and Ukrainian sides still hope to gain a decisive military advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Mobilization is seen as a way for Russia to potentially go on the counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. The current military situation is described as leaning towards a stalemate, a "positional war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

## Alternatives to Truce or Peace

The speaker does not currently see a realistic alternative to a truce or peace, though acknowledges that alternatives "can be terrible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>.

## Impact of Leadership Change on Negotiations

If the current Russian leadership is dismantled, whether Ukraine stops being bombed or continues will "depend on who replaces him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   One scenario involves new leaders who would "continue to put pressure on Ukraine" and maintain military confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.
*   Another scenario suggests that new leaders would "immediately announce a unilateral ceasefire," offer Ukraine to do the same, and propose to "immediately begin peace talks without any preconditions" on neutral territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

It is specifically stated that [[potential_peace_negotiations_involving_russia_and_ukraine | negotiations]] will be with "Russia, with the Russian leadership, but not with Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. Putin is not expected to be able to participate in any future [[potential_peace_negotiations_involving_russia_and_ukraine | negotiations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">[00:16:10]</a>.

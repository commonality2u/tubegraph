Russia is moving quickly towards the introduction of full or partial [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The urgency of this development is tied to recent events and the general direction the country is taking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Recent Events Contributing to Tension

Several incidents have contributed to an increasingly tense atmosphere within Russia:

*   **Moscow Kremlin Drone Attack** On the night of May 2-3, 2023, the Moscow Kremlin was attacked by drones of unknown origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. These drones were identified as Ukrainian by the Kremlin's press secretary and the Russian propaganda machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This public recognition is seen as an admission that "things are not going very well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The attack was symbolic, not military or political, aiming to show the Kremlin's vulnerability and that the Russian flag had "fallen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The target was not President Putin, who rarely stays in the Kremlin and prefers deep bunkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. One drone was shot down near the Senate building, where the state flag flies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Military Sabotage and Prevention Efforts** Prior to the drone attack, there were military-related incidents, including sabotage on railway transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The FSB also announced that an assassination attempt on the head of the Republic of Crimea, Aksyonov, was prevented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Widespread Drone Sightings** Drones regularly attack not only frontline areas but increasingly often the heart of the Russian capital, Moscow, and the Moscow region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Hysterical Atmosphere and Public Reaction

These events have contributed to an intensive and tense hysterical atmosphere in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Hysteria and Tension** Tension is characteristic of the Russian establishment across all echelons, while hysteria affects "mentally unstable layers of Russian society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Drone Mania** In Moscow and the Moscow region, there is a "mania" for searching and detecting Ukrainian drones, with up to 100 calls a day reporting sightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Most of these calls are considered "absolute nonsense" driven by the callers' fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Moscow Authorities' Response** Due to this mania, Moscow authorities ordered public utilities to monitor the capital's airspace, reminiscent of wartime scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. As of May 3, the Moscow mayor banned all drone launches except for "competent ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Informational Offensive** A Ukrainian offensive has begun in the informational, propaganda, and moral-psychological sense, creating an atmosphere of anxious expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Official Reactions and Deliberations on Martial Law

The authorities' reactions are primarily from the security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Patrushev's Demand** Security Council Secretary Patrushev demanded that President Putin immediately impose [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Formally, this would be an extension, as [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] is already in effect in the "new territories" or regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. The demand is for [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] to be extended to the Russian capital, frontline regions, and potentially other regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Putin's Postponement** Putin has postponed the decision until at least the end of the week, likely not before May 9, due to the desire to hold the Victory Day parade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Putin typically avoids hasty decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Reasons for Delay** Putin understands that introducing [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] would diminish his power in favor of the security officers who would control it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Legal Amendments** On May 3, amendments were introduced to the Federal Constitutional Law on [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]], specifically to allow elections in the so-called new regions of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. However, there is uncertainty whether these regional elections will be held at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

## Understanding Martial Law and its [[Impact of potential martial law in Russia | Impact]]

[[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | Martial law]] is defined as a set of restrictions on civil rights and freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Even without a formal declaration, elements of [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] can be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Key Restrictions Under Martial Law

*   **Travel Ban:** For individuals subject to military service, which includes potentially over 15 million people, a ban on travel outside the Russian Federation could be introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Movement Restrictions:** Restrictions on movement between regions are possible, though harder to implement than exit bans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Strengthening passport control is also expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Freedom of Speech:** There would naturally be a restriction of freedom of speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Internment:** The possibility of internment, meaning detention without trial or investigation for up to 30 days (which can be extended), would exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Conscription:** The implementation of conscription would become much easier, ignoring existing formal restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### Current Signs of Increased Control

Even without full [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]], signs of increased control are emerging:
*   **Mass Checks and Escorts:** In some cities (though not yet widespread in Moscow), mass checks of those subject to conscription and military service are beginning, with groups of young people being escorted to military registration and enlistment offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Digitalization and Surveillance:** Moscow, a "world champion of digitalization" with numerous video cameras, has seen incidents where individuals, like a young man at Sberbank, were tracked by police via video cameras and taken to military registration offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **Financial Restrictions:** Theoretically, bank cards and accounts of individuals [[potential_mobilization_and_military_service_changes in Russia | potentially subject to mobilization]] could be blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. The Central Bank and Nabiullina have reportedly prepared for this since September of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### Local Authorities' Role

The scope of restrictions under [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] will vary by region and city, depending heavily on the position of local authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Moscow Mayor Sobyanin, for example, is expected to try to protect Moscow citizens to maintain their loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

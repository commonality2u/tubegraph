This article discusses the legal foundations and potential [[consequences_and_impact_of_mobilization | consequences]] of mobilization, including its [[social_and_national_implications_of_mobilization | social and national implications]], and offers practical advice for individuals facing such a decision. The program emphasizes that a decision to mobilize is inextricably linked with the introduction of martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Legal Framework of Mobilization
Mobilization is defined as the transfer of a country's state structures, economy, and everyday life to a war footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Decisions on mobilization can only be made by the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Key federal laws governing mobilization include:
*   Federal Law 31: On mobilization preparation and mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   Federal Constitutional Law: On martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   Law: On military duty and military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The president may also rely on new legal acts that will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Types of Mobilization
Mobilization can be:
*   **Partial mobilization**: Affecting specific territories of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Full national mobilization**: Affecting the entire country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

It is suggested that even if mobilization begins as [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | partial]], it will likely and inevitably develop into a full national mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Grounds for Martial Law
The law on martial law lists specific reasons for its introduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Relevant grounds include:
*   Bombing of Russian Federation territory by foreign armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   Attack by foreign armed forces on Russian Federation armed forces, regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Exile of armed gangs, groups, regular forces, or mercenaries by a foreign state to carry out aggression against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

Formally, these legal grounds are already observable, allowing for the introduction of martial law and subsequent mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The Ministry of Defense has also stated that a provocation using chemical means from the Ukrainian side could serve as a justification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Who is Subject to Mobilization?
Citizens in the reserve are subject to conscription for military service during mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Men
*   All men with a military ID aged 18 to 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   Must have a fitness category of "fully Fit" (A) or "Fit with minor restrictions" (B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   Those with category "limited Fit" (V), who do not serve in peacetime due to health problems, can also be mobilized after 27 years old if they receive a military ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   Those in the reserve are distributed among three categories by age:
    *   First category: Men under 35 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
    *   Second category: Up to 45 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   Third category: Up to 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
    *   Conscription will begin with the first category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Women
*   Women are also subject to conscription for mobilization if they have the necessary education and military registration specialty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   This primarily includes medical education, but not exclusively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Proposed Changes
It is suggested that those who write the letter "Z" on their cars and support the "special military operation" should be mobilized first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Categories Not Subject to Mobilization or Eligible for Deferment
Current law provides for certain exemptions and deferments:
*   Those who have not served and have not received a military ID up to 27 years old are not considered in the reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Students of scientific educational institutions studying full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   Persons reserved for civilian needs (category G) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   Those temporarily not fit for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   Those caring for relatives or disabled people requiring supervision, confirmed by medical certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   Guardians of minor brothers or sisters if no other guardians exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   Parents with four or more children dependent up to 16 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   Single parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   Pregnant women after 22 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   Senators and deputies of the State Duma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. (It is suggested they should serve as a matter of honor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.)
*   The president can grant a deferment to certain categories of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   Individuals with an unexpunged or unexpunged conviction for a serious crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Petty hooliganism will not provide an exemption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   Those who received category "D" at the draft board, meaning generally not fit for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   Some exceptions exist for female military personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

It is noted that new legal acts may be adopted, potentially altering these deferment categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## [[consequences_and_impact_of_mobilization | Consequences and Strategies for Individuals]]

### Obligation to Appear
All citizens subject to conscription are obliged to appear at assembly points within the timeframes specified in mobilization orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Orders can be delivered at home or the workplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, potentially with police or Russian Guard escorts to ensure compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

### Travel Restrictions
Once mobilization is announced, those registered for military service are prohibited from leaving their place of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. If orders or a summons are received, individuals are obliged to appear at military commissariats or other authorities performing similar functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Valid Reasons for Not Appearing on Summons
According to Federal Law on Military Duty, military service, valid reasons include:
*   Illness or circumstances related to loss of ability to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   Serious health condition of listed relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   Death of relatives, requiring participation in the funeral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
Medical certificates are required for confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### Financial and Travel Implications
To stimulate compliance, decisions have been made to:
*   Block accounts and bank cards of those subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   Close travel abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

### Penalties for Evasion
In peacetime, not appearing on summons from the military registration and enlistment office incurs administrative liability:
*   Warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   Fine from 500 to 3000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

Evasion of military service in peacetime, under Article 328 of the Criminal Code, provides for:
*   Fine of up to 200,000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.
*   Imprisonment for up to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
The punishment in wartime is not specified, though martial law will likely be declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

### [[consequences_and_strategies_for_individuals_during_mobilization | Strategic Advice]]
Individuals are urged to consider personal [[consequences_and_strategies_for_individuals_during_mobilization | strategies]] now, as it will be too late to think and decide once mobilization is announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

**Financial Preparation:**
*   Transfer money to relatives' accounts in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   Withdraw cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   It is estimated that blocking bank cards will lead to a deeper financial collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

**Travel Preparation:**
*   Keep foreign passports in a safe, easily accessible place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

**Location Awareness:**
*   Mobilization will primarily affect residents of small and medium-sized cities, and last of all, large cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

**Prioritization:**
*   It is better to lose a little money than a precious life and no less precious health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

## Broader [[social_and_political_implications_of_mobilization_in_russia | Societal and Economic Impacts]]
Mobilization entails the transfer of the entire country, including its already frail [[economic_impacts_and_mobilization_economy_in_russia | economy]] and not very strong financial and banking system, to a military footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. This could include the confiscation of private cars needed for transporting mobilized people and other material resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. The full impact on the banking system is difficult to predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

The speaker describes living in Russia as experiencing "social hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

## Call to Action and Support
Individuals are urged to take the prospect of mobilization seriously and prepare for its consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Emphasis is placed on taking care of oneself, family, and friends, and supporting those in Russia who strive to maintain common sense, moral fortitude, and human dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

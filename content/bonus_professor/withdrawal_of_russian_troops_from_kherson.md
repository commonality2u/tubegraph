The [[russian_troop_withdrawal_from_ukraine | withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson]] marks a significant event in the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Russia-Ukraine conflict]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This development, which occurred on Sunday, November 13, 2022, and was publicized on Monday, November 14, signifies a "strategic turning point" and a "moral and political catastrophe" for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

## Strategic Turning Point

The [[russian_troop_withdrawal_from_ukraine | withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson]] consolidates a strategic turning point in favor of Ukraine, which began in late August/early September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. The strategic initiative in the armed confrontation has now "finally passed to Ukraine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

## Moral and Political Catastrophe for Russia

While the loss of Kherson is not considered a military catastrophe, it represents a "moral, psychological, and political catastrophe" for the Russian leadership and establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

### Loss of Faith in Victory
The primary reason for this catastrophe is the "final loss of faith in Victory" among the Russian establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Previously, there was a belief that while Russia couldn't win, defeat was unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Now, the establishment must adapt to the "inevitability of military defeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

### Putin's Status
In the eyes of the establishment, Vladimir Putin has become a "toxic loser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>, where everything he touches turns into its opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

### Consequences within Russia
The immediate consequences of this moral and political catastrophe include:
*   **Confusion of Headquarters**: The propaganda machine and political headquarters are "at a loss" on how to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This confusion is expected to be overcome, likely through tightened censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   **Search for a Way Out**: There is an "intensification of the search for a way out of the impasse" caused by the leadership's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
*   **Putin as the Main Cause**: Putin is increasingly recognized as the primary cause of this catastrophe, which is not only moral and political but also partly global <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
*   **Elite Discontent**: There is a "noticeable increase in discontent of the Elite," posing a fundamental threat to Putin's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

## Peace Proposal
Coinciding with the [[russian_troop_withdrawal_from_ukraine | withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson]], a peace proposal was immediately received by the Russian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. This proposal's outline was previously agreed upon by the Ukrainian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

### Key Terms of the Proposal
The proposed global agreements include:
*   **Territorial Withdrawal**: [[russian_troop_withdrawal_from_ukraine | Russia]] is to completely [[end_of_military_actions_in_ukraine | leave the territory of Ukraine]], including the DPR and LPR, with the exception of Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>.
*   **Crimea's Status**: Crimea would receive an indefinite status for seven years, during which negotiations would be held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. Crimea must be demilitarized, and the Black Sea Fleet must leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
*   **Demilitarized Zones**: A demilitarized zone 100 kilometers deep must be established along the borders of Russia with Ukraine and Belarus with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. Heavy weapons are to be removed from these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
*   **Ukraine's Promises**: Ukraine promises not to join NATO and not to raise questions about joining NATO for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>.
*   **Transnistria**: The Russian military base in Transnistria is to be moved back to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>, and Russia will not interfere with Transnistria's integration into Moldova in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.
*   **Immunity**: Russian civilians, military, and political figures are guaranteed "freedom, security," and the preservation of at least some assets, meaning they would "not be subject to punishment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. It is noted that "scapegoats will be punished" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.

### Indirect Signs of Russian Seriousness
There are indirect signs that the Russian leadership is taking this peace proposal seriously:
*   **Nuclear Weapon Plans**: Consideration of plans for the use of tactical nuclear weapons "collapsed" on Friday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. While these plans could be revived, an order was issued to curtail them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   **Erdogan's Mediation**: Turkish President Erdogan announced his intention to meet with Putin soon to discuss the [[prospects_for_ending_the_russiaukraine_conflict | prospects of a peace agreement with Ukraine]], followed by a visit or call to Zelensky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.
*   **Strikes on Energy Infrastructure**: A potential third sign would be if Russia abandons the idea of inflicting another massive blow to Ukraine's energy infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.

Taking the proposal seriously does not mean readiness to accept it, but rather a willingness to consider it, possibly to gain time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

### Reparations and Justice
The issue of reparations or financial compensation for the damage suffered by Ukraine was not mentioned in the materials received regarding the peace proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. Russia would never use the term "reparations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that "good and justice do not necessarily win" in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.

## Ukrainian Response and American Position

Ukrainian military capabilities are "critically dependent on American aid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:39:00">[13:39:00]</a>. A decrease or cessation of this aid would accordingly reduce Ukraine's military capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>.

The American position currently favors a pragmatic approach: inflicting a military defeat on Russia on the battlefield, ideally through the hands of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>. However, there is "no idea to change the political system" in Russia from outside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:19:00">[14:19:00]</a>, as direct interference could lead to negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>. Ukraine can influence military success but cannot directly influence what happens within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:01:00">[15:01:00]</a>; any political change or punishment of the guilty in Russia must come from its own citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>.

## Internal Russian Dynamics Regarding Blame
In the aftermath of the [[russian_troop_withdrawal_from_ukraine | withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson]], the search for those to blame will begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>.

*   **Military**: The military will likely be blamed for Russia's defeat, but only "when the peace treaty is signed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>.
*   **Turbo-Patriots**: Immediately, those who shouted loudest, the "Turbo-Patriots," who are now criticizing the authorities, will be blamed and repressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. Figures like Igor Ivanovich Strelkov and Alexandrovich Dugin are mentioned as examples of those who could face repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:00">[18:13:00]</a>.
*   **Censorship and False Political Targets**: Censorship is expected to tighten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>. A "false political target" may be created for the "ununderstanding" elite, possibly a new political party fronted by figures like Strelkov and Dugin, to channel discontent into early parliamentary elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:24:00">[19:24:00]</a>.

## Reflections on Responsibility and the Future
The speaker asserts that the current situation is a consequence of paths chosen, or at least not intensely resisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>. Everyone is responsible, including the nation, for its actions and misdeeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:07:00">[16:07:00]</a>. Despite the challenges, the speaker expresses conviction that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:10:00">[23:10:00]</a>.

On July 10th, 2023, Russian presidential press secretary Peskov stated that a meeting occurred on June 29th in the Kremlin between Yevgeny Prigozhin and the commanders of the Wagner private military company with President Putin, lasting three hours and ending on a positive note <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This assertion is described as "elementary brazen lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Fabricated Narratives and Their Purpose

The speaker asserts that no meeting took place on June 29th, nor any time after, with Prigozhin or the Wagner PMC in any capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The most that could have happened, and even this is doubted by more substantial sources, was a telephone conversation between Putin and Prigozhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

The reasons for this "brazen lie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> are primarily:
*   To project an image of Putin as a "wise Leader" who is "in complete control of the situation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This aims to support the Russian president's reputation, which "suffered catastrophically" after the Wagner mutiny in the eyes of the elite, the deep state, and partly society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This narrative portrays the events as "Putin's multi-move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   To demonstrate that Putin is "physically capable" and "in decent condition," which does not correspond to reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## The Use of Doubles and Putin's Health

It is claimed that the president "physically cannot meet with anyone and appear anywhere" and is "constantly replaced by a double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Reportedly, two doubles are most often used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The speaker stresses that "any representative of the Russian elite" has no doubt about the existence of a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, nor does "any self-respecting intelligence service of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Skeptics of this idea remain only "among the mass of society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, to whom the television message of an "omnipresent president" is sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

An examination conducted in a G7 country, involving phonoscopic (voice) and anthropological analysis by multiple independent experts, concluded that "under the general name of the President of Russia," there are "three different people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. According to a reliable source, Putin's physical condition is worse, and he is "blind already in his left eye," consistent with developing metastasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Putin's International Standing

The third reason for the official lies is to conceal the "humiliation of the president in the international arena" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Turkey's Actions:** President Erdogan transferred Azov fighters to Ukraine, supported Ukraine's NATO accession, and promised intensive military aid, including Bayraktar drone factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The Kremlin and Putin remain silent because "Russia is critically dependent on the so-called parallel import that passes through Turkey" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Macron's Refusal:** The Kremlin has recently been trying to get Macron to agree to a telephone conversation with Putin, but the French president is refusing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. This marks a reversal from 2005, when Macron sought conversations with Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

The speaker notes that both the Russian and Western elites understand that Putin is "not just a lame duck, he is a dying nature, that he is a person who is not capable of making decisions and is not capable of making these decisions publicly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Travel to regions or abroad would involve a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

## State Media's Ineffective Smear Campaign Against Prigozhin

Last week, Russian official media attempted to compromise Prigozhin by publishing information about his luxurious lifestyle and wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. However, this PR campaign is deemed strange and ineffective for several reasons:
*   There is "no negative PR" except an obituary; any attention keeps a person afloat and forms their fame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
*   [[impact_of_propaganda_on_russian_society | Russian society]] is generally immune to exposure, partly due to the work of Navalny's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. Repeated video analyses without political action lead to immunity and a perception that such behavior is the norm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.
*   The politically active and interested part of [[public_opinion_and_its_impact_on_russian_political_dynamics | society]] draws information from alternative sources, not central television channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Prigozhin's political events and calls were distributed through Telegram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

## The Unfolding Crisis and Call for Engagement

The speaker warns of an "extreme situation" arising in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. Prigozhin is seen as an "icebreaker that split the ice surrounding Putin's regime," opening up free space for "other people" and potential coups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. Multiple groups or networks are reportedly dreaming of seizing power in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

For "ordinary citizens of Russia" with "civic temperament and a sense of conscience," this crisis offers a "unique opportunity" to participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. Staying in "operational communication" is emphasized, with Telegram being the easiest method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:38">[00:20:38]</a>. Subscribing to the "Doctor Nightingale" Telegram channel is recommended to receive necessary operational information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. Financial support is also encouraged as a form of [[public_engagement_and_activism_in_russias_political_landscape | civic activity]] contributing to the "liberation of our Motherland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

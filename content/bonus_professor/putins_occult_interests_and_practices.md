The current situation in Russia is increasingly linked to [[Occult practices in Russian politics | occult]] interests, which are deepening and are associated with the position and significance of "demiurge" [[President Putins actions and intentions | Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Elite's Occult Hobbies and Pyramids

There's a constant discussion around the fear of [[Putins Control and Health Speculations | Putin]]'s death and newfangled hobbies that attempt to domesticate or overcome this fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Recently, a man reported that a group of businessmen, potentially connected to Prigozhin, are building a pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The architect of this pyramid is Valery Uvarov, who also designed the "Crystals and Lounge" spa and salon in St. Petersburg, owned by Prigozhin's spouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Photos of this object near Tomsk are available online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

This interest in Egyptian-style pyramids is symptomatic of an [[Occultism and magical practices in Russia | occult hobby]] among the Russian elite, with pyramids being constructed across the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. United Russia deputies and large businessmen in Tomsk are involved in this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### The Origins of Russian Pyramid Building
The area near Tomsk was chosen for pyramid construction due to an archaeological expedition in the late 1980s that discovered Bronze Age artifacts, including items related to Egyptian culture, in disturbed graves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. While trade routes could explain the presence of these items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>, the modern version of pyramid history suggests ancient Egypt was built on the ruins of an older civilization, which is credited with the three great pyramids and the Sphinx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Notably, the remains of pharaohs were never found in these three great pyramids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Step pyramids, built during the third dynasty in ancient Egypt, were not used for mystical rites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. However, they were used for such rites in Mesoamerica, for example, at temple complexes in Palenque and Chichen Itza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Nowadays, three small pyramids in the labyrinthine tunnels of the Ligand Gorge in Nepal are used for ritual purposes by shamans of "black faith" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### Purpose of Pyramids in Russia
Two theories exist for the construction of pyramids in the Tomsk region:
*   **Tombs:** If aligned with the pharaonic period, they are seen as tombs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Mystical Power:** According to Russian "black ideas" about pyramids, they are endowed with mystical power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. In this model, the pyramid's top holds the political subject, the middle tier contains "shamans" (former Soviet-era party workers), and the bottom tier includes a "well-known Russian folk doctor Malakhov" with his ideas on prolonging life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

One example given is a farmer in southern Russia who built a large pyramid, claiming it cured his diseases, increased his cattle, and boosted crop yields, though he went bankrupt a couple of years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Specific Rituals and Predictions

The rise of the [[Influence of occult practices in Russian politics | occult component]] in the current government is linked to the desire to prolong life, heal, or gain afterlife bonuses, especially for [[President Putins actions and intentions | Putin]] himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This extends to officials imitating the "first overlord" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>.

### Putin's Non-Christian Rites
In April of the current year, [[President Putins actions and intentions | Vladimir Vladimirovich]] performed "very strange non-Christian rites" during Easter with an elder known as "Nikifor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. These rituals, performed at the Novospassky Monastery courtyard in Moscow, were for [[Putins Control and Health Speculations | Putin]]'s health and protection, as well as for "induction of damage" and "evil" upon his enemies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Such practices are not accepted among Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

### Prophecies and Political Decisions
Early in his management, [[President Putins actions and intentions | Vladimir Vladimirovich]] turned to three fortune tellers to learn his future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. These three predictions were "almost identical" and indicated that he would rule for 20 years as a "king," but the end of his reign would be "terrible if he cannot change the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. The predictions were not veiled, and "real things" related to Russian politics, like Georgia and Ukraine, could be easily read into them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

Intriguingly, all three predictions were delivered without the final paragraph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. This missing paragraph contained phrases such as "all twelve turn away from you" and warnings about a "southern ruler of poisons, husband of the state southern ruler" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. This phrase is interpreted as referring to Milosevic, Mubarak, and Gaddafi, all "southern rulers" to be feared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Regardless of how credible these predictions are, what matters is how they were perceived and used as guidance by those who sought them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

This is considered a "driver" of "real Russian politics and foreign policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. The attempts to "deceive history" or "challenge fate" as [[Vladimir Putins policies and impact | Putin]]'s 20-year reign approaches its end are evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>.

## Decline of Putin's Luck and Elite Fear

There is an "esoteric fear" among the elite, combined with [[Putins Control and Health Speculations | Putin]]'s "fading age" and exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Since August 9-10, 2020 (when the Belarus revolution began), everything seems to be falling apart, including Russia's influence in the South Caucasus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

Those who traditionally had access to [[President Putins actions and intentions | Putin]] now complain about the "impossibility of meeting and talking with him," leading to "extreme nervousness" and "semi-panic" among the establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. The number of people communicating with him is "extremely limited" by the president himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. There's a widespread feeling of "loss of luck" among the elite, who once had an "almost mystical belief in [[President Putins actions and intentions | Putin]]'s luck" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. This year, they've stopped saying he'll "cope" or "pull through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

## The Santa Marta Cult and Relics

The discussion delves into specific [[Occult rituals and psychiatry in Russia | occult magical practices]] indulged in the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. The "indefinite quarantine" and unprecedented isolation measures around [[President Putins actions and intentions | Putin]] suggest a fear that an infection like coronavirus could lead to a "tragic outcome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a>. This situation drives rationalists to seek miracles in irrational manifestations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

[[President Putins actions and intentions | Vladimir Vladimirovich]] is described as not a religious person in the classical sense, with his visits to the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC) being mostly "protocol events" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. The power elite perceives this as a trend to follow, but they treat the mystical element as a "miracle" rather than an act of faith <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>. For them, Christianity is a "religion of the flesh" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. As a KGB native, [[President Putins actions and intentions | Putin]] understands the ROC system from within and harbors no illusions about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>. However, he does not reject the ROC's "main attribute of the miracle" â€“ relics and human remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

Human remains have been exploited by religious cults since ancient times, and the demand for them remains high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>. There are examples of discrepancies, such as two heads of John Chrysostom or the mummified, circumcised corpse given out as Saint Alexander of Svir 500 years after his death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. A recent case involved a man detained in Krasnoyarsk carrying a "whole skeleton of a deceased" for sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:26">[00:25:26]</a>. These "diggers" are at the lowest level of a hierarchy, with cynical, educated people at the top, some holding scientific degrees in art history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>.

The skeleton in the Krasnoyarsk case was reportedly designated as the remains of a "Byzantine king, a great warrior," and was intended to be used to arrange an "altar of Santa Muerte" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. People pay "a lot of money" for such items, with amounts like 250,000-300,000 American dollars being considered "ridiculous" for officials who handle billions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>. This allows them to acquire an "attribute of miracle" and supposedly receive "unthinkable benefits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

### Understanding Santa Muerte
Santa Muerte is a "Mexican syncretic cult" combining elements of Christianity and traditional Mexican beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. The cult has three varieties:
*   **Black Death:** For career growth and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>.
*   **Golden Death:** For wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.
*   **White Death:** For worldly goods like love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.

The altar requires a skeleton or skull, which "must belong exclusively to a powerful person" (e.g., a general), as a "fool's" remains would lead to a "stupid" result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>. Many significant graves in Central and South America have been dug up for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>. The cult is widespread in Mexico and northern South America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:33">[00:30:33]</a>. Adherents may practice both Catholicism and Santa Muerte rituals simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

## Occultism as a Trend in Russian Elite

The prevalence of "mystical, quasi-esoteric and pseudo-occult moods" is much worse now than during the end of the Russian Empire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:56">[00:38:56]</a>. It's rare to find a group within the establishment not strongly influenced by these moods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>. Each group has its "fashion" or "passion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>, previously seeking Shambhala, then Orthodox elders, and now shamans from various regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. A sharp demand for esotericism and [[Occultism and magical practices in Russia | occultism]] has been growing since 2014-2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.

The leader's style sets the fashion, and people distinguish themselves by choosing exotic cults or fashionable shamans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. There are fashionable fortune tellers and astrologers with "colossal" queues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>. This market for "quasi-occult and pseudo-esoteric services" is thriving on a "huge amount of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>, enriching both charlatans and their suppliers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. Intermediaries even brief the "magicians" on what the client wants to hear to ensure "biased confirmation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:58">[00:41:58]</a>.

The elite resorts to "magical instruments" because they "cannot change reality with the usual... political, economic instruments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>. They believe in a "world government" and secret "chanceries" that rule the world, as depicted in Pelevin's novels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:06">[00:43:06]</a>. They "compete" and turn to various magical or pseudo-occult resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>, with some bringing groups of shamans to live in their luxurious homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.

### The Kayapo Tribe and Cannibal Shamans
A Ukrainian oligarch brought an Amazonian shaman from the Kayapo tribe to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>. This tribe has a "monopoly on export to other countries and continents of shamans with low social responsibility," due to their integration into Brazilian politics and economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. These shamans are briefed on what the client wants to hear, making the business very profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:11">[00:47:11]</a>.

A more extreme example is the Yamomami tribe in Brazil and Venezuela, known for long trances induced by psilocybin mushrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:04">[00:48:04]</a>. This tribe is unique because they are cannibals and are "not socialized at all" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>. After a shaman kills a victim in an [[Occult rituals and psychiatry in Russia | occult trance]], the entire tribe eats the victim, and even the ashes, believing they possess "special mystical power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

## Kremlin's Relationship with Occult Orders

The Kremlin has "no contacts" with the 13 great world [[Occult practices in Russian politics | occult orders]]; in fact, they have "insurmountable contradictions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>. This conflict stemmed from a perceived insult from "certain human words" by the great master of the 13 orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>.

The ritual initiated by the 13 great world [[Occult practices in Russian politics | occult orders]] on the summer solstice (June 21) performed by authentic shamans in the K-Ligandovsky Gorge in Nepal is cited as a turning point, implying events changed significantly thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>. The "factory of luck," which was associated with [[President Putins actions and intentions | Putin]], disappeared after August 9, 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. Militaristic rhetoric also disappeared, indicating that plans for "small victorious wars" to boost ratings (e.g., taking Narva or Kherson, or northern Kazakhstan) no longer manifest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:15">[00:53:15]</a>.

The 13 world [[Occult practices in Russian politics | occult orders]] consist of four components: political, economic, scientific research, and metaphysical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>. The conflict between them and the Russian establishment is primarily due to political aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>. The orders are founded on criteria like freedom, enlightenment, and knowledge without censorship, which are "completely rejected by the Russian establishment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:47">[01:01:47]</a>.

These [[Occult practices in Russian politics | non-public organizations]] exert influence through their adherents within the Russian government and Western governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:50">[00:54:50]</a>. They are considered "political subjects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:41">[00:55:41]</a>. Examples of public figures engaging in ostentatious [[Occult practices in Russian politics | occult practices]] include former Kalmykia head Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, who claims to have met aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>, and "clownish" figures like lawyer Trunov and political strategist Bogdanov who openly associate with "Templars" and "Masons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. True "Freemasonry" and the "Order of the Templars" are non-public and do not advertise their activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>.

## Current State and Outlook

The current situation in Russia is described as a "new Middle Ages" where people are poisoned, the government participates in "dense black magic rituals," and worships "remains of the dead" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. This is a period of "turbulence" in Russia, creating a great demand for "a miracle" among the establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>. The elite hopes [[President Putins actions and intentions | Putin]] leaves and "everything remains as it was," but this is considered impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:06">[00:59:06]</a>. [[President Putins actions and intentions | Putin]]'s attempts to "outwit history" and perform another miracle are also seen as impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:21]</a>.

There is a feeling of "fear" within the establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>. They feel a "deep line" and "deep nothing," not understanding where threats will come from, likening Russia to a "cemetery where twilight thickens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>. The "20 years that were wasted" have accumulated "a lot of hatred" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.

The speaker expresses satisfaction that a message was conveyed to a "target audience" regarding the 13 orders always collecting their "debts in full" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>. The period of this "new Middle Ages" is believed to be "very short" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>. The situation is characterized by the use of "tools" appropriate for the "era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.

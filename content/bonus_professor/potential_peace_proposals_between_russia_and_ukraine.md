Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, in episode 37 recorded on November 13, and released on November 14, discusses the concept of a "strategic turning point" and the search for peace following significant military developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The primary focus is on the impact of the Russian troop withdrawal from Kherson and the subsequent [[proposed_peace_deal_and_russian_capitulation | peace proposal]] presented to the Russian leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Background: Kherson Withdrawal and its Impact
The withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson is seen as a strategic turning point that has consolidated in favor of Ukraine, shifting the strategic initiative to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. While not a military catastrophe, it represents a "moral, psychological, and political catastrophe" for the Russian leadership and elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This event has led to a loss of faith in victory within the Russian establishment, which now faces the inevitability of military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. As a result, Putin is increasingly viewed as a "toxic loser" by the establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The consequences of this catastrophe include:
*   Confusion within the propaganda machine and political headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   An intensified search for a way out of the impasse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   The recognition of Putin as the main cause of the catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   A noticeable increase in elite discontent, posing a fundamental threat to Putin's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## The [[proposed_peace_deal_and_russian_capitulation | Proposed Peace Deal]]
A [[peace_negotiations_with_ukraine | peace proposal]] was reportedly received by the Russian Federation leadership on the day of the Kherson withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. The outline of these [[western_consultations_on_peace_in_ukraine | peace proposals]] was agreed upon, although many details remain unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The proposals originated from a serious, influential side that cannot be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

Key points of the draft global agreements include:
*   **Territory:** Russia's complete withdrawal from Ukrainian territory, including the DPR and LPR, with the exception of Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Crimea Status:** Crimea would receive an indefinite status for seven years, during which negotiations would be held. Crimea must also be demilitarized, and the Black Sea Fleet must leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Demilitarized Zones:** A 100-kilometer deep demilitarized zone must be established along the border of Russia with Ukraine and the Belarusian border with Ukraine, with heavy weapons removed from Russia and Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Ukraine's Commitments:** Ukraine promises not to join NATO and not to raise questions about joining NATO for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Transnistria:** The Russian military base in Transnistria would be moved back to Russia. In 2023, Russia would not interfere with Transnistria's integration into Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Immunity for Russians:** Russian civilians, military, and political figures would not be subject to punishment, guaranteeing their freedom, security, and at least partial preservation of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. However, it is expected that scapegoats will be punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

Reparations or financial compensation for Ukraine were not mentioned in the materials received but are expected to be discussed during [[peace_negotiations_with_ukraine | peace negotiations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

## Indications of Russian Consideration
There are indirect signs that the Russian leadership received and is seriously considering the [[proposed_peace_deal_and_russian_capitulation | proposal]]:
1.  **Nuclear Plans Curtailed:** Consideration of plans for the use of tactical nuclear weapons collapsed on Friday, with an order to curtail these plans issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
2.  **Erdogan's Mediation:** Turkish President Erdogan announced his intention to meet with Putin soon to discuss the [[prospects_of_peace_between_ukraine_and_russia | prospects of a peace agreement]] with Ukraine, followed by a visit to Kyiv or a phone call with Zelensky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
3.  **No Massive Strikes (Potential Sign):** If Russia refrains from inflicting another massive blow to Ukraine's energy infrastructure, this would be a third indirect sign that the Kremlin is seriously considering the [[potential_peace_negotiations_involving_russia_and_ukraine | peace proposals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

However, serious consideration does not mean acceptance; the Kremlin might be trying to gain time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## International and Domestic Perspectives
### American Position
The American position reflects a pragmatic approach: while a military defeat must be inflicted on Russia on the battlefield, the idea is not to change Russia's political system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. America believes that the internal political changes in Russia should occur naturally, as direct interference could lead to negative outcomes for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

### Ukrainian Influence
Ukraine, having achieved military success, is no longer able to influence what happens internally in Russia regarding political changes or the punishment of the guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. This will be the responsibility of Russian citizens themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

### [[kremlins_view_on_peace_with_ukraine | Kremlin's View on Public Opinion]]
The Kremlin has historically disregarded public opinion, only considering it when confronted with force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Currently, there is little chance for Russian public opinion to become a significant force unless it unites, particularly among those dissatisfied with the current state of affairs and willing to act against the "toxic asset" (Putin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### Blame and Repression in Russia
The search for those responsible for the defeat is expected to begin. While the military might be blamed later, particularly after a [[proposed_peace_deal_and_russian_capitulation | peace treaty]] is signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>, the initial blame will fall on "Turbo Patriots" â€“ those who loudly supported the conflict and now criticize the authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Figures like Igor Strelkov and Alexandr Dugin are highlighted as potential targets for repression and intimidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. Censorship is also expected to tighten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>. It is speculated that these figures might be used to front a new "party of turbopatriots" for early parliamentary elections, a method to control and dilute dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

Recent sociological data indicates a significant shift in [[Public opinion and political shifts in Russia|public opinion]] within Russia regarding the ongoing conflict and the country's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. This shift is notable in both open and closed surveys conducted by various sociological centers, including those commissioned by the Federal Security Service (FSO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.

## Support for Peace Negotiations

According to data from a "foreign agent" organization (Jellyfish), citing closed FSO surveys, 55% of Russians are now in favor of peace negotiations with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. In contrast, only 25% support the continuation of the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

These findings are corroborated by surveys conducted by the Levada Center, an independent sociological center in Russia. Their October data showed 57% in favor of peace negotiations and 27% supporting the continuation of military actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. The 2% difference between these figures is considered insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Public Opinion

The shift towards supporting peace negotiations is attributed to several key factors:

*   **Increased Access to Reliable Information** Accurate information about the events is becoming more accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.
*   **Impact of Partial Mobilization** The initial stage of [[Mobilization process in Russia|partial mobilization]] significantly affected [[Public opinion and political shifts in Russia|people's attitudes]] towards the military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. Previously perceived as a distant "computer game," the conflict now impacts every home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.
*   **Fear of Future Mobilization** Growing fears exist regarding a potential second stage of [[Mobilization in Russia and potential nationwide mobilization|mobilization]], which is anticipated to be far more extensive than the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:09">[00:24:09]</a>. These fears are considered justified, as the Russian political leadership may resort to sending more personnel to the front to counter Ukrainian advances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

## Public Concerns and Economic Realities

The public's main concerns revolve around questions of survival, Russia's economic prospects, the country's future, and the global context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Economic outlooks are generally described as "joyless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Despite official statements from President Putin noting a "positive dynamics in reducing the poverty level," claiming it dropped to 10.5% by the end of the third quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, [[Public opinion and sociology in Russia|public opinion]] contradicts this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Only 23% of Russians are satisfied with their financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Furthermore, 43% of microcredit loans in Russia have overdue payments exceeding three months, indicating widespread financial hardship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that the Russian government and elite seem to live on "another planet" and are detached from the economic realities faced by the general population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

## Propaganda and Collective Responsibility

[[Public reaction and propaganda in Russia|Russian state media propagandists]] like Simonyan and Skabeeva have suggested that if Russia "loses," everyone will face consequences at The Hague, attempting to establish a sense of collective responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. This narrative aims to bind the population to the regime's fate, implying that the public must fight to prevent the leadership from facing justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. However, the speaker argues that the fates of the public and the propagandists, who have enriched themselves at society's expense, are distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>.

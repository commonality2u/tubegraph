The 18th episode of "What Is Happening" discusses a potential "Second Front" opening in the context of [[geopolitical_events_involving_russia_and_belarus | geopolitical events involving Russia and Belarus]], specifically focusing on Lithuania's transit ban to Kaliningrad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Lithuania's Decision and Western Involvement
Lithuania implemented a ban on a significant portion of transit to the Kaliningrad region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. It has been speculated that the West might be provoking Russia through this action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. However, this is described as "idle speculation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. NATO and the European Union are not interested in escalation, as a conflict involving Lithuania could escalate into a "hot phase," which NATO does not need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

Instead, Lithuania's decision was most likely intended to demonstrate its independent sovereign status and was adopted arbitrarily, possibly with some influence, but not from Brussels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Brussels is interested in improving relations with the Russian Federation, not provoking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## Potential for Conflict and Russian Strategy
The possibility of conflict is unfortunately real at present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Russia is preparing to demonstrate "force blackmail" rather than direct actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Involving Belarus
To put pressure on Lithuania, Russia desires to involve [[belarus_russia_relations_and_potential_union_treaty | Belarus]] in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. There are discussions about provocations being carried out from Belarusian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Intensive negotiations between Putin and Lukashenko have taken place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. Putin's fixed idea is to restore the unity of the Soviet Union, at least as a union of East Slavic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

Pressure on Lukashenko, including "foul language," aims to push him towards a real union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Putin's means of involving Lukashenko in this union involve drawing [[belarus_russia_relations_and_potential_union_treaty | Belarus]] into the force blackmail network against Lithuania and into military confrontation with [[ukraine_russia_conflict | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Lukashenko reportedly consented during a special meeting with Putin, stating, "I agree to the Supreme Court, only leave me free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. However, it is unlikely that Lukashenko will not try to avoid Moscow's embrace, as he has done for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### NATO and EU Response
If Russia resorts to forceful blackmail against Lithuania, NATO would be compelled to intercede, potentially by using Article 5 of the NATO charter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. However, a conflict is not obligatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. The European Union may threaten Lithuania with economic blackmail, specifically withholding subsidies and transfers, if Lithuania does not make concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Lithuania is a "poor country" that relies heavily on financial assistance from the EU <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## Other Potential "Second Fronts"
Beyond Lithuania, a second front could open from Russia's southern borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. The Taliban, considered an extremist organization in Russia, has reportedly calmed down after receiving compensation from the Kremlin, partly in cash and partly in oil supplies and equipment, to prevent an invasion of Tajikistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This is critical for Russia because its efforts are concentrated on the western direction in [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Furthermore, Tajikistan and Russia are members of the CSTO, and aggression against Tajikistan would obligate Russia to intervene, which it currently lacks the resources to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

It is suggested that Western countries are actively working with the Taliban to encourage a strike against Tajikistan in August, thereby opening a "Second Front" in the south <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. The head of Ukrainian military intelligence, Budanov, made a statement about expecting turning points in August, which could refer to new weapons supplies and this hypothetical southern front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

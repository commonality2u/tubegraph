The health and public appearances of [[health_and_leadership_concerns_of_vladimir_putin | Vladimir Putin]] have become a significant concern, both within Russia and internationally. His physical well-being and reliance on [[speculations_around_putin_and_doubles | doubles]] for public engagements are increasingly under scrutiny, impacting his political standing and the perception of Russia's leadership.

## Deteriorating Health
Sources indicate that [[health_and_leadership_concerns_of_vladimir_putin | Vladimir Putin]]'s health is "extremely bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. The establishment within Russia is aware of this dire situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Despite intensive treatment and ongoing therapy, his health is described as "not so hot," with varying success and high risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This feeds into [[health_rumors_about_the_russian_president_and_political_implications | health rumors about the Russian president and political implications]].

## Use of Doubles
A notable aspect of [[health_and_public_appearances_of_president_putin | Putin]]'s recent public life is the alleged use of [[speculations_around_putin_and_doubles | doubles]].
*   During the last week of April 2023, the president did not show up at public events; instead, his [[speculations_around_putin_and_doubles | double]] appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   The opening of the Turkish nuclear power plant was reportedly attended by a [[speculations_around_putin_and_doubles | double]] of [[health_and_leadership_concerns_of_vladimir_putin | Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This [[speculations_around_putin_and_doubles | double]] is noted for being well-trained and capable of speaking "almost like the president," though occasionally stuttering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   There is uncertainty whether the actual Russian President will attend the May 9th parade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>, raising further questions about [[health_and_public_appearances_of_president_putin | his public appearances]].

The discussion of [[speculations_around_putin_and_doubles | the president's doubles]] is intensifying, not only outside of Russia in Western media (including tabloids and serious publications) but also within the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. This has become a widespread discourse, reaching most of the country and middle-level officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### Official Reactions
Dmitry Peskov, the president's press secretary, has indirectly responded to these speculations by emphasizing [[health_and_leadership_concerns_of_vladimir_putin | Putin]]'s "wonderful health" and "hyperactivity," claiming he doesn't stay in bunkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. However, it's observed that [[health_and_leadership_concerns_of_vladimir_putin | Vladimir Vladimirovich]] does work with documents, often from a bunker, and conducts meetings from there, while a [[speculations_around_putin_and_doubles | double]] appears at public events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. The Russian elite often avoids participating in events where a [[speculations_around_putin_and_doubles | double]] appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

## Political Implications
The existence of [[speculations_around_putin_and_doubles | doubles]] has become a "media reality" and a "reality of public opinion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This perception, regardless of its physical reality, will influence people's behavior in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. The president is no longer seen as a source of well-being but as a "key problem," "key threat," and a "toxic asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This constitutes a significant internal political problem for [[putins_control_and_health_speculations | Putin's control and health speculations]].

Furthermore, [[health_and_public_appearances_of_president_putin | Putin]] has faced international isolation. South Africa, for instance, requested that he attend an August conference via video link rather than in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. Consequently, the president has reportedly decided against most international trips, with the possible exception of Minsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

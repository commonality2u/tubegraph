## Challenges with Mobilization and Equipment
A viewer's question highlighted the difficulties faced by families of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilized]] individuals. One mother, Nadezhda Doschina from Khabarovsk, expressed confusion about the purpose of the ongoing situation and the lack of readiness for [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] within the country. She noted that pensioners were left to gather supplies for their relatives, despite television reports claiming preparation was underway for troops [00:02:34].

The speaker suggested that to understand the situation, one should honestly answer three questions [00:03:13]:
1.  Who crossed the state border on February 24? [00:03:20]
2.  On whose land are [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_russia | military operations]] taking place? [00:03:32]
3.  Where did taxes go that were supposed to provide the armed forces with first-class weapons, excellent equipment, and other necessities? [00:03:41]

It is noted that citizens are currently left to equip their own children, husbands, and even grandchildren [00:03:55].

## Ongoing Mobilization and Changing Criteria
Despite a [[political_address_and_military_mobilization_measures_in_russia | president's statement]] that conscription within the framework of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] has been stopped, [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] itself has not been halted [00:09:32]. This information was confirmed by a hotline dedicated to [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] inquiries, as reported by the popular Telegram channel "Base" [00:09:41].

### Potential Expansion of Mobilization Criteria
If the number of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilized]] individuals is to be increased, it would necessitate softening the criteria for conscription [00:09:56]. This could include extending [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] to those without combat experience or previous military service, similar to what occurred during the so-called [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | partial mobilization]] [00:10:10]. The affected area of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] is expected to expand significantly [00:10:27]. However, the age limit is not expected to change from what it was during the [[potential_mobilization_in_russia | partial mobilization]] [00:10:32].

### Self-Sufficiency in Equipment
The speaker indicated that people would continue to purchase their own uniforms, bulletproof vests, and other necessary equipment, as was the case during the first stage of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] [00:10:40]. Citizens are expected to take out loans and go into debt to buy these items, increasing the survival chances of their relatives [00:10:55]. In terms of weaponry, if Kalashnikovs are insufficient, North Korea is suggested as a potential source [00:11:09].

## Potential for Widespread Martial Law and Control Measures
The second stage of [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] may be associated with the spread of [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law | martial law]] to major Russian cities, possibly even across the entire territory of Russia [00:11:32].

> [!CAUTION] Projected Control Measures
> Information suggests a plan for almost complete control over the population [00:11:52]. This control could be implemented through QR codes with differentiated access [00:12:03].
> *   **First Group (largest, over 70-80% of population)**: Prohibited from leaving their subject of the Federation [00:12:27].
> *   **Second Group**: Somewhat expanded travel capabilities [00:12:41].
> *   **Third Group (smallest, most trusted individuals including security forces)**: Allowed to move throughout the Russian Federation, but not to leave the country [00:12:47].

It is speculated that to travel abroad, a special permit might be required, implying that borders could be closed for all citizens [00:13:10]. Movement within the subjects of the Federation is also expected to be greatly limited [00:13:40].

Additional restrictions under [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law | martial law]] could include a curfew and the possibility of internment, which allows for detention for 30 days without trial or investigation [00:13:55]. The Sakharov detention center near Moscow is reportedly designated for this purpose [00:14:06].

The speaker expressed serious doubts that these far-reaching plans for total control would be realized due to organizational inefficiency, predicting that they would quickly devolve into chaos, disorder, and total disorganization [00:14:20]. Such growing discontent could influence the supreme military leadership's decisions regarding the maintenance of a [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law | martial law]] regime [00:14:43].

There is also a possibility that bank cards will be blocked for those included in the database of individuals potentially subject to [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] [00:15:26].

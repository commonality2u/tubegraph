## Demographic Trends

In October 2022, Russia experienced an 11% fall in the birth rate compared to October of the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Since the beginning of the year, the country's population has decreased by half a million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. The speaker notes that the population is "degrading" and "decreasing in anthropological material" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Interpretations and Goals

The speaker references Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's 1990 treatise *How to Organize Russia*, which stated that the main task of the authorities should be to "save the people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The speaker questions who benefits from the "transformation of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> if the population is declining.

According to the speaker, the current situation suggests an "ideal that is now actually being realized" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> where Russia becomes "a land free of people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. In this vision, a "so-called Elite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a> rules, accompanied by "25-30 well 570 million servants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

As of Sunday, May 29th, the offensive by [[russian_military_operations_in_ukraine | Russian troops]] continues at a steady pace, engaging in fierce battles across various fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The [[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_strategy | Russian military]] has reportedly adopted new tactics during its [[goals_and_implications_of_russias_special_military_operation | special military operation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## "Salami Tactic"

The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation have switched to a tactic described as the "salami tactic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This involves "gnawing off pieces" of Ukrainian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

The key direction for this tactic is currently the Luhansk region, within the Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. As superiority is achieved and local tactical goals are met, the intention is to create superiority in other directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Effectiveness

This tactic is considered "quite successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. As of May 29th, 20% of Ukrainian territory is under the control of the Russian Armed Forces, compared to only 7% (including Crimea) on February 23rd <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This represents a significant operational and tactical success, though not a strategic one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Interpretation of a "Peace Agreement"

For the Kremlin, "peace" is interpreted differently than by European countries like France and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. While European nations suggest a return of [[russian_military_actions_in_ukraine | Russian troops]] to pre-February 24th positions and a ceasefire, the Russian Federation views a "peace agreement" as a truce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

This truce is seen as "extremely beneficial for the Kremlin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a> because it provides time to:
*   Regroup forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>
*   Bring up new contingents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>
*   Acquire military equipment, which is becoming increasingly difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>

The Kremlin is "categorically not interested" in returning troops to their pre-operation positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Any step taken by Ukraine towards the Kremlin for a pause would exclusively benefit the Kremlin by allowing it a respite for redeployment and strengthening its positions in currently controlled territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Exhaustion of Resources

The issue of resource exhaustion is "very clearly visible" for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. Evidence includes:
*   The abolition of the age limit for signing the first military contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
*   The re-activation of outdated T-62 tanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   Allegations of forced round-ups of young men (18-27 years old) in Dagestan, particularly Makhachkala, for military registration purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

These indicators suggest that resources are being depleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. The long-term military situation could be determined by which side, Ukraine or Russia, runs out of resources faster, or if both are simultaneously exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Ukraine also needs time to receive promised weapons and train personnel to use them, potentially delaying any strategic counteroffensive until late summer or early autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Integration of New Territories

Russia is preparing for the integration of newly controlled territories, referred to as "new territories," into its composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. This process aims to replicate the integration of the self-proclaimed republics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. There is a decision to abandon the idea of burning down Sara from The Hague, and instead to quickly incorporate parts of the Kherson and Zaporizhzhia regions into the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. It is unclear if this will be done through a referendum or without one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

Initial steps in these territories include the appearance of Russian mobile operators and large TV panels in cities like Mariupol, emphasizing "spiritual food" (brainwashing) over material restoration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This means a change in territorial status that benefits the Russian Federation and would be legitimized for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

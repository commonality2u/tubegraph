From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The topic of [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] has generated significant public concern and questions, with its contours described as "increasingly ominous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Planned for implementation after the New Year holidays, this phase of mobilization is expected to be more organized and tougher than previous iterations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Scope of Mobilization

The current intentions suggest a much larger scale of mobilization than initially discussed. The plan is to mobilize up to two million people, which notably includes 300,000 women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This new wave will no longer be referred to as [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | partial mobilization]] but will be declared as a general mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Integration with Martial Law

This mobilization is designed to be carried out in conjunction with the introduction of martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Martial law has already been enacted in the "new territories" of the Russian Federation and is expected to be extended to either all of Russia or a significant portion of its territory, including Moscow and St. Petersburg, after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Implications of Martial Law

The introduction of martial law grants authorities significant powers with far-reaching [[social_and_national_implications_of_mobilization | social and national implications]].

### Labor Mobilization and Property Seizure
Under martial law, authorities gain the right to conduct labor mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Individuals not called into active military service, specifically those aged 14 to 60 or 65, can be assigned to work that strengthens the country's defense capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Furthermore, martial law embeds the possibility of:
*   Forced change of ownership of an organization or enterprise, implying that private companies could be nationalized or transferred to "patriotic hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Seizure of private property with subsequent compensation, though the nature of this compensation is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This measure is expected to be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Communication and Movement Restrictions
Martial law also provides for the possibility of restricting freedom of communication and the use of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

In terms of movement, a database of up to 7 million people potentially subject to mobilization is being compiled and will be transferred to border services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. These individuals will be unable to leave the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. While a complete ban on leaving Russia is not expected, a partial ban for those in the database is deemed "very, very easy to do" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## [[consequences_and_strategies_for_individuals_during_mobilization | Consequences and Strategies for Individuals]]

The speaker outlines severe personal choices for those affected by mobilization.

> [!WARNING] Choice
> "On one side of the scale you will have life, on the other side of the scale temporary inconvenience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Financial Impacts
The [[financial_and_societal_impacts_of_mobilization | financial and societal impacts of mobilization]] are a significant concern. For those mobilized, a deferment of loan and mortgage payments is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. If a mobilized individual dies, there's uncertainty about whether loans will be written off or preferential terms offered to their family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This is primarily a question for the state, not just banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

Regarding savings:
*   **Currency deposits:** Already frozen and forcibly converted to rubles, with serious doubts about whether they can ever be retrieved in their original currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.
*   **Ruble deposits:** Are not threatened by confiscation, as the Central Bank can print as much money as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>. However, the ruble is expected to depreciate catastrophically during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.
*   **Recommendation:** Keep savings in assets that are easily movable and can be used as a means of payment or exchange for rubles, primarily dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. Gold is also mentioned as an option, but with significant caveats regarding liquidity and storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:59">[00:22:59]</a>.

Regarding assets like apartments and cars, the decision to sell and withdraw funds depends on personal strategy, especially if one is forced to leave Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>. However, for those without mansions, typical apartments are not expected to be nationalized, as the situation is not yet comparable to 1918 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

### Specific Concerns
*   **Students:** A full-time student with a military ID is unlikely to be mobilized, but a final-year student carries a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Women:** 300,000 women are targeted for mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Doctors and medical personnel are primary targets, but other specialties are unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Women not subject to mobilization are hoped to retain the ability to leave the country after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Return to Russia:** It is advised against returning to Russia from abroad if one wishes to avoid being sent to the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## [[social_and_political_implications_of_mobilization_in_russia | Societal and Political Implications]]

### Public Compliance and Control
[[mobilization_strategies_and_public_compliance | Mobilization strategies and public compliance]] are being enhanced. Summonses are reportedly ready in Moscow, and photos of those subject to mobilization are being entered into the facial recognition system, particularly effective in the Moscow metro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This allows authorities to approach individuals in the metro and "politely offer" them to go directly to a mobilization point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The slogan for this will be "everything for the front, everything for Victory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Military Readiness and Effectiveness
There are serious doubts about the authorities' ability to provide uniforms, equipment, and other necessities for such a large number of mobilized people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Despite this, the authorities are determined to achieve their goals, believing that this number of mobilized individuals can at least withstand the Ukrainian offensive and cement Russian defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### [[psychological_reactions_to_mobilization_news | Psychological Reactions and Protest Potential]]
Polls conducted by federal security services, which inform the highest authority, show Putin's rating is much lower than official figures suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. The readiness of Russian women to protest is gradually growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. The protest potential of Russian society is assessed as "quite high," based on indirect signs like societal neurosis and acts such as the arson of military registration and enlistment offices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. However, this potential is being actively extinguished and suppressed by authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

## Wider Geopolitical and Future Outlook

### Ukraine's Response
To counter Russia's goals of destroying Ukraine's energy sector, Ukraine is advised to:
1.  Pressure Western countries for more modern and long-range weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
2.  Carry out a successful offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
3.  If long-range weapons are obtained, strike at Russian infrastructure beyond border regions, potentially expanding the affected area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

Preparation of bomb shelters in Moscow and other cities indicates anticipation of possible shelling in the European part of Russia from long-range Ukrainian weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

### Nuclear Weapons and Escalation
The probability of the Kremlin using nuclear weapons, including tactical ones, is not zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. The decision to use nuclear weapons may occur if the situation on the fronts becomes "completely lousy" for Russian forces, or if the general mobilization fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. There is a chance that Putin's entourage would prevent such an order from being implemented, but relying on this chance is not advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

The West has promised a retaliatory strike with conventional weapons if tactical nuclear weapons are used by Russia, a plan considered for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This could lead to a path of escalation, potentially resulting in a massive tactical nuclear strike by Russia if its conventional forces are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. While Europeans are hesitant due to potential suffering, the Americans and Britain are ready to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Putin hopes they will retreat, but they did not retreat on February 24, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

### Future Prospects for Russia
The speaker predicts "troubled days ahead," characterized by disorganization and chaos that could make the 1990s seem like a "faint reflection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>. However, this will be contextual, not affecting all places equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.

Food rationing is being prepared in some regions, not due to shortages, but to provide cheap access to provisions for socially vulnerable groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.

The speaker believes there is a chance for a quiet life and development for young people in Russia, and for middle-aged people to see a life without war, sanctions, and lawlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. However, this will require going "through deterioration to get better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. The upcoming year is expected to be harder than 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Adaptation
> "People are what they are. To change the framework, their behavior will change. It is not at all necessary to expect or hope that a precondition for change will be a modification of people's consciousness, although it will happen by itself if the propaganda machine is turned off, as soon as state propaganda... stops working. People will gradually begin to come to their senses." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
> Additionally, giving people a "creative perspective" and the opportunity to live and develop will help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

The financing of government procurement for repairs and reconstruction in the social sphere will be reduced, while defense industry funding will grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>.

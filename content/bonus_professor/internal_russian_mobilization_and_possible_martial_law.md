This article, based on a November 16, 2022, recording, discusses the escalating conflict between Russia and Ukraine, focusing on the implications for Russia's internal [[russian_political_and_military_mobilization | political and military mobilization]] and the potential for [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Rejection of Peace Proposals and Escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>

The Kremlin's launch of a massive missile strike on Ukrainian infrastructure on November 15, 2022, indicates President Putin's rejection of a peace proposal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This strike was on an "unprecedentedly large scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This rejection signifies an escalation of military action, a "transition to a new, more dangerous phase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

The incident in Poland, where missiles hit and killed two Poles, is currently under investigation, but it is unlikely to become a *casus belli* leading to NATO activating Article 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Russian Strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>
President Putin has reportedly decided to resort to a "spearhead counter-escalation" strategy, realizing this will lead to a build-up of military power and strikes on Russian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Ukrainian Response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>
In response to Russia's rejection of peace, Ukraine is expected to receive new, longer-range weapons, including long-range ammunition and missiles, and potentially drones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This expansion means that not only border regions but also areas deeper into Central Russia will be within the destruction zone of the Ukrainian armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Nikolai Patrushev, Secretary of the Security Council, was reportedly sent to inspect the air defense system in Central Russia for readiness to repel new challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

Recent events include the undermining of the steel key oil depot in the Varlovskaya region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Ukrainian troops have allegedly gone on the offensive towards Popasnaya <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Russian Military Actions and Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>
Massive shelling by Russia is expected to continue if Russia has enough missiles or receives them from its strategic ally in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. However, a major offensive or counteroffensive by Russian armed forces in Ukraine is deemed unlikely, as Russia has adopted a concept of "strategic defense" involving the use of mobilized protective contingents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Internal [[Mobilization in Russia and potential nationwide mobilization | Mobilization]] in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>

Despite President Putin's announcement that [[russian_mobilization_and_military_actions | mobilization]] was over, the relevant regulatory document has not yet been submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Consequently, military registration and enlistment offices continue to issue calls for [[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

There are predictions of a second stage of [[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization | mobilization]] scheduled for after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. However, if events develop rapidly, especially if a Ukrainian offensive proves successful, this second stage may be hastened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. At a minimum, currently mobilized personnel undergoing training will be sent to the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

The second stage of [[mobilization_in_russia_and_potential_nationwide_mobilization | mobilization]], if it occurs, will likely be termed "additional mobilization to partial mobilization" or "completion of partial mobilization" by authorities, using euphemisms to disguise the true state of affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

## [[General Mobilization and Martial Law in Russia | Martial Law]] and its [[Impact of potential martial law in Russia | Impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>

[[potential_martial_law_in_russia | Martial law]] may be introduced in a number of large cities of the Russian Federation after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. This would extrapolate from the "new territories" of Ukraine, extending first to regions bordering Ukraine, and then potentially to Russian capitals like Moscow and St. Petersburg, and other large cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

If [[potential_martial_law_in_russia | martial law]] is introduced, it will be accompanied by further restrictions on civil liberties, including freedom of movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. New, hybrid authorities, such as military-civilian administrations or military commandants, would receive special rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

These new authorities could:
*   Introduce a curfew <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   Detain any citizen in regions under martial law without trial and investigation for 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   Confiscate property from citizens, enterprises, and firms, such as all-terrain vehicles or equipment for uniforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Broader Crises and Future Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>

The ongoing military crisis is predicted to inevitably develop into a large-scale and acute political crisis, potentially leading to the collapse of Russian statehood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. This does not mean Russia will disappear, but it suggests a significant transformation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

The Russian president's personal strategy is to escalate, or "raise the stakes," believing this is the only way to force the West to retreat and pressure Ukraine into a peace agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. However, the West is not expected to retreat and will increase its pressure on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. Russia's combined power is deemed unable to withstand the pressure of the consolidated West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

The current military crisis will be accompanied by an economic crisis and a financial crisis that is already unfolding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. The economy is already significantly connected to the "special military operation," and this share is expected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

The speaker expresses that Russia is entering the "darkest times" of its history in the 21st century, comparable to events a hundred years ago, such as the Crimean War (1853-1856), the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and the First World War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. The current period is seen as comparable in scale to the events of 1990-1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

Despite falling popularity for Putin, protest moods are not growing rapidly enough to offset authorities' fear, leading them to "tighten the screws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. There is a warning that excessive tightening could lead to the entire structure of Russian statehood falling apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

A dilemma may arise for Putin: admitting loss or using tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. While the idea of using tactical nuclear weapons is currently on hold, it is not considered taboo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

In these challenging times, it is emphasized to help each other, maintain health, normal family relationships, and common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:48">[00:19:48]</a>. The speaker maintains that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

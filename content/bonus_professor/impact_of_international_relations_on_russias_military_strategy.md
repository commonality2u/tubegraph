International relations significantly influence Russia's military strategy and considerations, particularly concerning its conflict with Ukraine and broader geopolitical standing.

## Influence of the United States and NATO
The United States has actively played a role in inciting certain armed conflicts throughout its history, including the wars in Afghanistan (after September 11, 2001) and Iraq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This historical context frames how Russia views U.S. foreign policy.

In the current conflict, the United States has placed a bet on Russia's military defeat, with the expectation that such a defeat would lead to political changes within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>. This strategic aim influences the provision of military aid to Ukraine. Delays in arms supplies to Ukraine are attributed to both a fear of President Putin's unpredictability and the reluctance of some European countries for Ukraine to achieve outright victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:05">[00:59:05]</a>. The unpredictability of the leader of a nuclear power is a significant concern for other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:33">[00:59:33]</a>.

Concerns about [[NATO]] involvement also affect [[Russian military operations and international relations | Russia's military strategy]]. For instance, Russia is very cautious about striking transport hubs in Ukraine, such as railway tracks or transfer points for military equipment from European to former Soviet gauge. There is a high risk that Russian missiles could accidentally hit neighboring territories, such as Poland, which could trigger [[NATO]]'s Article 5 and lead to direct [[Russian military operations and international relations | NATO]] intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. This fear is a major deterrent for Russian decision-makers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.

## Internal Debates and Nuclear Weapons
The potential for a crushing military defeat for [[Russias military strategy and internal debates | Russian armed forces]] in Ukraine, particularly in spring or early summer, raises the question of using tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. This issue remains on the agenda for Russian leadership, even if not openly discussed in media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.

However, there is a growing probability that individuals within President Putin's inner circle might attempt to prevent such an order from being carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:36">[00:20:36]</a>. These individuals are reluctant to see [[Russian foreign policy and military strategy | Russia]] become a permanent pariah state or transform into a [[future governance and geopolitical strategies of Russia | North Korea-like]] isolated nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. While a small group in the ruling elite, influenced by figures like Nikolai Patrushev, might favor a path towards isolation, the broader establishment desires to remain connected to the world and enjoy its benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. The socio-cultural landscape in [[Russian foreign policy and military operations | Russia]] has changed over the last 20-30 years, leading the establishment away from total isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

## Regional Dynamics and Future Outlook
The fate of Transnistria is seen as highly likely to change within the next five years, directly linked to an impending crisis in [[Russian foreign policy and military strategy | Russia]]. It is unlikely that [[Russian foreign policy and military operations | Russia]] will be able to maintain control over Transnistria during such a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.

Regarding Belarus, its direct entry into the war is considered extremely unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:34">[00:53:34]</a>.

In the long term, if [[Russias military strategy and internal debates | Russia]] critically weakens, there is a possibility of China expanding its presence into demographically sparse parts of [[Russian military strategy and challenges | Russia]]. This would be a demographic rather than military "filling" of voids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.

The security forces in [[Russian military strategy and challenges | Russia]] generally view the ongoing special military operation as unsuccessful and express unhappiness about a planned general offensive, considering it a dangerous and potentially doomed undertaking that could lead to colossal losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:48">[01:09:48]</a>. They had advocated for a strategy of strategic defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:17">[01:10:17]</a>. This internal dissent within the security apparatus could potentially lead to mass sabotage if an offensive begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:25">[01:10:25]</a>.

Overall, Russia's military strategy is deeply intertwined with its international standing, the reactions of key global players, and internal considerations regarding its future as a global actor.

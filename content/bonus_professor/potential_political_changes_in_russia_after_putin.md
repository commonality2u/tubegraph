Professor Valery Solovey anticipates significant changes in Russia following the physical death of Vladimir Putin, which he believes will occur "absolutely definitely before the end of autumn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:45">[03:48:45]</a>, possibly even earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. These changes are expected to usher in a period of intense [[future_political_and_social_changes_in_russia | sociopolitical transformation]].

## Immediate Aftermath of Putin's Death

Upon Putin's physical death, there will be an attempt to hide the information, though it will not succeed for long <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Solovey states he will inform the public within 2-3 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. Once the information reaches society and the elites, including regional ones, a shift and movement will begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:43">[04:11:43]</a>. After a short period of stability, Russia will "most likely plunge into chaos," which Solovey hopes will be short-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

## Key Figures and Their Roles

### Yevgeny Prigozhin
Contrary to widespread belief, Yevgeny Prigozhin is alive, well, at large, and currently in Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. The FBI has not canceled his arrest warrant, and American intelligence agencies are aware he is alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. Prigozhin intends to reappear soon after Putin's death and reveal "a lot of interesting things," particularly concerning the Russian president's doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. He will likely become part of a "broad combination" or alliance, as he did not act independently on June 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

### Roman Abramovich
Roman Abramovich has served as an intermediary in negotiations, a role he has historically played <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>. He is connected to influential Russian figures like Sergey Chemezov, head of Rostekhnologii <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:37">[01:18:37]</a>. However, his intermediary efforts are "categorically unacceptable" to a significant and currently strong part of the Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:44">[01:18:44]</a>.

### Sergei Shoigu and Dmitry Peskov
After Putin's death, nothing good awaits Sergei Shoigu or Dmitry Peskov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:44">[03:33:44]</a>. Shoigu lacks influence within the armed forces and will be unable to play any independent role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:58">[03:33:58]</a>. Their fate is expected to be "very deplorable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### Other Figures
The existence of a "Kiriyenko group" is denied; therefore, Sergey Kiriyenko's group has no chance of seizing power in the impending crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:35">[03:37:35]</a>. Vladislav Surkov also holds no positions and no longer decides anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Putin's Doubles and Their Future
The Western world and China are aware that Putin is being replaced by doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:42">[02:08:42]</a>. China is even prepared to receive a double on a visit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:49">[02:08:49]</a>. There is an internal conflict among those managing Putin's rule regarding the use of a double as "number one" for some time, possibly even for presidential elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. This conflict is serious and will inevitably lead to a clash, resulting in public exposure of Putin's death and the existence of doubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:11">[02:09:11]</a>. The double knows his life is in danger but hopes to slip away or for things to resolve themselves, having been promised freedom and "colossal compensation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## Justice and Accountability
Solovey asserts that "real criminals" will be tried. He has no doubt that trials for those who committed crimes "against humanity, against society, against their people, and against their country" will begin as early as next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:15">[01:49:15]</a>.

## Economic and Social Landscape
A large-scale economic crisis is expected to be synchronous with the [[potential_political_crisis_in_russia | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Signs of this crisis, such as ruble devaluation, inflation, and economic instability, are already apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. The speaker highlights that a colossal amount of money, an estimated 4 trillion US dollars (twice the previously stated 2 trillion), has been withdrawn from Russia, profits obtained from the sale of resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This amount, he claims, could have transformed Russia into a "semblance of an earthly Paradise" comparable to the United Arab Emirates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

The authorities will initially attempt to shield the public from instability by concealing Putin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. While many Russians may regret Putin's departure or fear instability, this mood may prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Future Governmental and Administrative Structures
It is considered appropriate and necessary to remove government agencies from the Kremlin and transform it into a museum complex, a step that will eventually be taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. In a new Russia, Solovey supports transforming the country from a nominal federation into an actual one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. The first step towards this is granting greater budgetary independence to the regions of the Russian Federation, which is seen as the foundation for federalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. The country's environmental problems are also addressed within the proposed program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

Regarding freedom of speech, Solovey personally supports the American model with fewer restrictions than the European one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. The new Constitution, if prepared by a constitutional conference, could be adopted by referendum and potentially include alternative formulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

## External Influences and International Relations
The West and China prioritize their own interests: China seeks to maintain Russia's economic dependence for raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>, while the West desires political stability and control over Russia's nuclear arsenal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. Both are willing to deal with a double or a new dictator if these conditions are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. This policy is described as "absolutely hypocritical and two-faced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>, and it is not beneficial to the citizens of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

Regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict, Solovey believes the Kremlin "added fuel to the fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, but states it does not threaten a third world war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. Military actions in Israel will not directly bring closer the end of the "special military operation" in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## Upcoming Events and Prospects
Solovey expects "grand events" in the coming months, possibly a year and a half, which will exceed the scale and consequences of the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. He believes Russia will have a chance to embark on a path of "correct, free, competitive, and competitive development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

He will be holding an online event on October 26 at 8 PM Moscow time, titled "After Putin," where he will discuss the formation of a post-Putin reality, who has realistic and unrealistic plans, society's potential participation, and the relationships between elite groups regarding the division of Putin's legacy and power succession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

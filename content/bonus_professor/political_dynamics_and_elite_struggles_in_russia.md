This article outlines the complex [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | political dynamics]] and [[power_struggles_and_elite_coalitions_in_russia | elite struggles]] within Russia, drawing insights from recent events and internal power shifts.

## Internal Power Dynamics and Elite Coalitions

The current [[internal_politics_and_power_dynamics_in_russian_leadership | political landscape]] in Russia is characterized by intense [[power_struggles_and_elite_coalitions_in_russia | elite coalitions]] and [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | power struggles]] among various groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:17">[02:47:17]</a>. These struggles are often visible to the general public through seemingly orchestrated public appearances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:26">[02:44:26]</a>.

### The Role of Putin's Double and Elite Factions
A significant aspect of current Russian [[political_figures_and_power_dynamics_in_russia | political figures and power dynamics]] involves the use of a double for the Russian president, identified as Evgeny Vasilyevich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:58">[02:36:58]</a>. This double is reportedly supervised by the presidential security service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:26">[03:08:26]</a>.

A public reprimand of Denis Manturov by "Putin" (the double) regarding inappropriately spent money on waste incineration plants was initiated by the Patrushev group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This group reportedly enjoys a good relationship with the presidential security service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. Despite the public nature of the reprimand, Manturov responded "worthily" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.

### Influence of Key Groups

*   **Patrushev Group:** Initiated the public reprimand against Manturov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Chemezov's Group:** This group has reportedly achieved significant outcomes by preventing a new wave of mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a> and hindering the use of nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>. They are also credited with preventing many "extremely dangerous things" from occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>. The speaker highlights that the absence of these negative events often means the public is unaware of the behind-the-scenes efforts to prevent them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.
    *   An example given is the prevention of two or three wars in the post-Soviet space by a former high-ranking US official, though these wars eventually happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.
    *   Another example is the blocking of tactical nuclear weapons use around March-April 2022 by "brave, courageous people" at the cost of their careers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.

### Kremlin "Towers" and the War in Ukraine

The "Kremlin towers" (factions) wish to end military actions against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. However, the "power" or "Chekist" tower desires to end the conflict on more militant terms compared to the "pragmatist and realist" tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Plans for a truce with Ukraine remain in force, but their implementation terms can shift due to circumstances like the escalation of military actions in November <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. The US side, potentially under a new administration, is sending signals that it will not tolerate delays in reaching a truce and is ready to use blackmail if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

Regarding Mariupol, its fate on the "maps of the towers" is now less important than the plans of elected President Trump, as the Russian elite will likely have to adhere to his plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:04:00">[42:04:00]</a>.

### Other Political Figures and Relations

*   **Denis Manturov:** Was seriously considered for the role of president and is seen as "certainly better" than Putin due to his human and professional qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>. Public opinion is not considered in such decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:00">[21:54:00]</a>, and Putin's actual support has not exceeded a third in recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>.
*   **Ramzan Kadyrov:** Has poor relations with Russian security forces, with the exception of Zolotov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:58:00">[27:58:00]</a>. He has excellent relations with Mishustin, who reportedly does everything Chechnya needs, "even a little more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:12:00">[28:12:00]</a>.
*   **Tatyana Golikova:** Is kept in her position by the system to serve as a target for public discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:22:00">[30:22:00]</a>.
*   **Konstantin Ernst & Sergei Lavrov:** Their apparent negative changes in behavior and appearance are attributed to "rationalization," where individuals find excuses for bad actions, leading to the manifestation of their worst qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:16:00">[35:16:00]</a>.
*   **Yevgeny Prigozhin:** Is alive and well, known to Western powers, and continues to visit Europe and operates in "dangerous proximity" to Russian territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:37:00">[47:37:00]</a>. He is expected to "come on stage" when he deems it desirable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:37:00">[47:37:00]</a>.
*   **Bashar al-Assad:** The Kremlin needs him for money, specifically $130 billion in foreign exchange reserves that were reportedly paid for political asylum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:42:00">[45:42:00]</a>. Yanukovych similarly paid billions for asylum, which financed Russian military operations in Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:57:00">[45:57:00]</a>.

## Unforeseen Circumstances and Postponed Plans

Political plans, even coordinated ones, are subject to "unforeseen circumstances" or "variables" that can appear unexpectedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   The planned change of Prime Minister by the end of the year was postponed due to such circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
*   Information leaks can also play a role in blocking plans, such as the potential appointment of Viktor Khmari as acting Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

Some decisions are announced with absolute certainty, as they are known not to change. Examples include:
*   The decision for Russia's military action against Ukraine in February-March 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.
*   Navalny's "terrible fate" and death after the failure of an exchange idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.
*   Mass fertility tests for women of childbearing age, with psychiatric examinations for those unwilling to have children, which began in autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

## Economic Outlook and Policy

*   **Inflation:** Official statements on accumulated inflation over three years (2012-2015) claim 28-29%, but alternative calculations suggest no less than 90%, which is considered closer to the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. The rate of price growth is expected to accelerate next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.
*   **Currency Exchange:** The Central Bank management predicted a dollar cost of 120 rubles by late autumn/early winter, and they now project 150 rubles in the first half of the next year, not excluding 200 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:00">[15:43:00]</a>.
*   **Deposit Freezing:** Restrictive exchange steps will likely be applied, with potential freezing of deposits. It is suggested that deposits up to 1,400 units might be untouched, which could be supported by the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>. While this idea was postponed until spring/summer, it could be launched earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:02:00">[21:02:00]</a>.
*   **Foreign Investors:** A group within the leadership is actively trying to prevent measures that would harm foreign investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>.
*   **Digital Ruble:** Plans to forcibly transfer frozen Russian funds to a digital ruble are false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:21:00">[26:21:00]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency:** Russian authorities are not preparing to arrest or confiscate cryptocurrency, as they widely use it themselves to circumvent sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:04:00">[48:04:00]</a>. All crypto exchanges are reportedly under FSB control, and transactions over $20 are recorded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:28:00">[48:28:00]</a>.

## Sociopolitical Outlook and Reforms

### Future Challenges and Changes
The year 2025 is predicted to be harder for Russia than the outgoing year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>, but 2026 is hoped to be easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:00">[26:00:00]</a>. Radical changes for the better are anticipated for the upcoming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:38:00">[26:38:00]</a>.

### Post-Transition Reforms
A new leadership aims to implement significant changes:
*   **Justice System:** The judicial system will be reformed, with "complete lustration" of the judiciary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:16:00">[24:16:00]</a>. Those who broke the law will "answer according to the law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:37:00">[23:37:00]</a>.
*   **Education and Healthcare:** Extensive, massive, and comprehensive actions will be taken to reform education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:11:00">[29:11:00]</a> and healthcare systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>. While full changes might take 10-15 years, initial positive impacts could be felt within the first year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:40:00">[29:40:00]</a>.
*   **Retirement Age:** After coming to power, the issue of returning to the previous retirement age and compensating those who did not receive their pension will be considered and likely implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>.
*   **Travel Bans:** A significant part of bans on leaving the Russian Federation imposed by bailiff services will be lifted through tax and other amnesties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:16:00">[31:16:00]</a>.
*   **Yarovaya Package:** The "Yarovaya SORM package," which mandates data storage by telecom operators, is planned for cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:02:00">[31:02:00]</a>.

### Vision for Russia's Return to the Civilized World

The phrase "Return of Russia to the civilized world" implies:
*   **Getting rid of illusions:** Abandoning self-deception that a large majority of compatriots live in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:17:00">[39:17:00]</a>.
*   **Ending Corruption:** Disposing of embezzlers and scoundrels currently ruling Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:22:00">[39:22:00]</a>.
*   **Respect for Human Rights:** A world where people are not morally or psychologically raped, where privacy is respected (no interference with correspondence or work/business), and where participation in "mass murder" is not encouraged or called patriotism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:49:00">[39:49:00]</a>.
*   **Social Values:** A civilization where women are respected, animals are valued, and there is a good attitude towards people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:13:00">[40:13:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Welfare:** Pensioners do not receive meager payments in a country rich in natural resources, and social security levels are comparable to Central European countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:28:00">[40:28:00]</a>.
*   **Peaceful Life:** A "normal, decent, peaceful human life" instead of constant violence against one's own people and attempts to bring this violence into the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48:00">[40:48:00]</a>.

There was a significant chance for Russia and Ukraine to have a more friendly, good-neighborly relationship, which depended more on Russia, but the Kremlin leadership did not want to use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15:00">[41:15:00]</a>.

The speaker expresses confidence that future leaders will work for the good of society and not solely for personal gain, based on personal knowledge of these individuals and the intention to build a system of control that minimizes such risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:55:00">[42:55:00]</a>. There are enough "honest people" who wish to make a career serving the truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:44:00">[46:44:00]</a>.

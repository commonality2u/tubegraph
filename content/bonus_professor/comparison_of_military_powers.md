Valery Solovey discusses the strategic situation of the Russian Federation, particularly highlighting the concept of a "strategic trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This program, the 47th episode, was recorded on January 8th and aired on January 9th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Defining a Strategic Trap

A "strategic trap" is a term applicable not only in [[military_strategy_and_developments | military art]] but also in business and other fields where strategy is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. In [[military_strategy_and_developments | military terms]], it is characterized by two main features:
1.  **Fundamental Inability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>: One party in a conflict is fundamentally unable to achieve its military-political goals through military means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
2.  **Continued Escalation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>: Despite this fundamental inability, the party continues to increase efforts to achieve these goals, even when they appear obviously unattainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Historical Examples
Superpowers throughout history have fallen into such traps, which tend to be prolonged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>:
*   **United States**: Vietnam (1965-1973) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a> and Afghanistan (2001-2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Soviet Union**: Afghanistan (1979-1989) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Modern Russia**: Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The duration of this conflict is yet to be determined, though it is suggested it may not be as long as previous examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

All these situations concluded with a withdrawal and a political defeat, though not necessarily a direct military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Colossal resources were spent to no avail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Reasons for Falling into Strategic Traps

Countries or even corporations can fall into strategic traps due to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>:
1.  **Overestimation of Own Power**: The party in conflict overestimates its own economic and military capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
2.  **Underestimation of Enemy Strength**: The strength of the enemy is underestimated, including not only military power but also the ability of civilians to sustain resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
3.  **Misunderstanding of Theater of Operations**: The significance and specifics of the [[military_strategy_and_developments | theater of military operations]] are not properly understood or represented (e.g., jungles in Vietnam, mountainous terrain in Afghanistan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
4.  **Error in Assessing Strategic Context**: Underestimation or error in judging the broader strategic context, such as the involvement of other superpowers or international assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. For example, North Vietnam received aid from the Soviet Union and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, Afghanistan received assistance from the West against the Soviets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, and Ukraine is currently supported by the West with equipment, intelligence, technology, and personnel (e.g., Western PMCs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Reasons for Persisting in Strategic Traps

Despite predictions and warnings, countries often persist in these situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>:
1.  **Arrogance of Power**: A belief that superior economic and military potential will eventually prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This "arrogance of power" was seen in the US during Vietnam and Afghanistan, and in the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. It is also characteristic of Russia's actions in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
2.  **Cognitive Delusion**: A psychological phenomenon where leaders, like a casino player, continuously raise stakes hoping to recoup losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Robert McNamara's approach in Vietnam, constantly increasing military presence, and Russia's "Energy war" in Ukraine are examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This applies to businesses that continue to invest in losing projects, unwilling to "fix losses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
3.  **Distorting Properties of Religion/Ideology**: While not typical for the US or Soviet Union, ideology played a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. The Iran-Iraq War, which lasted 8 years and resulted in over 1.5 million casualties, is cited as an example where passionate ideology (victorious Islamic revolution) sustained the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Superpowers vs. Smaller Nations
Only countries with colossal economic and [[military_strategy_and_developments | military potential]], like superpowers, can afford to persist in cognitive delusions within strategic traps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Economically developed but smaller nations are more quickly forced to abandon conflicts due to [[impact_of_resource_depletion_on_military_conflicts | resource overstrain]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Democratic systems, with their criticism and competition, compel leaders to react faster to [[impact_of_resource_depletion_on_military_conflicts | resource depletion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

Average conflict duration over the past 200 years ranges from 3-4 to 16-18 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. Authoritarian leaders, however, persist because losing or exiting on perceived "dishonorable" terms risks the loss of their political power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

## Russia's Current Strategic Situation

Russia, unlike the Soviet Union, is not a superpower in terms of economic potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
*   **Russia's GDP share**: 1.7% of world GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.
*   **Western GDP share**: US (23%), EU (17%), plus Japan and South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>.

This demonstrates a "colossal incomparability" of economic and [[military_strategy_and_developments | military potentials]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. Given the West's support for Ukraine, victory for Russia is not feasible; the discussion shifts to conditions for an honorable withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. Russia missed a chance for such a withdrawal in March of the previous year when Ukraine was ready for concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. Now, neither Ukraine's leadership nor society will make concessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>.

The situation for the Russian Federation and its leadership is worsening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. To achieve an "honorable exit" that can be presented as a victory, Putin is willing to use available resources:
*   **Nuclear Tactical Weapons** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.
*   **Manpower**: Believing Russia's human potential significantly exceeds Ukraine's, Putin is willing to "throw people into the furnace of confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Losses of up to half a million people are considered acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.

[!INFO] Lack of Transparency in Military Losses
The Russian Ministry of Defense does not confirm or refute estimates of its own losses, preferring to report on Ukrainian losses. This leads to improbable statistics, such as Ukraine having no soldiers left or its air force being destroyed multiple times over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

## The True Goal of the "Special Military Operation"

The goals of the "special military operation" are now internal to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. The main goal for Putin is to preserve his own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. However, this strategy is weakening his power daily, as those around him and in society realize the country is caught in a trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.

A quote attributed to Japanese swordsman Miyamoto Musashi, author of *The Book of Five Rings*, aptly describes Russia's situation: "Immature strategy is the reason for sadness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. This immature strategy is characteristic of the Russian government and will intensify sadness for the country, its people, and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>.

The speaker expects the coming year to be much more difficult, but expresses hope that it will offer a chance to decisively influence Russia's destiny, with ultimate victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

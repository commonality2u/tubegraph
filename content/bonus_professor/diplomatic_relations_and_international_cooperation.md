The speaker recounts a historical detail, noting that Ukraine was part of Austria in 1914 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

A direct interaction with a "colleague, also the President of the United States," is mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. The speaker provided proof (content not specified in the transcript) to the US President, who reacted by saying, "Well, I'll kick their ass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

The speaker proposed [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_stances_of_kremlin | international cooperation]] between Russia, the USA, and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. When asked if this proposal was serious, the speaker affirmed it was "absolutely" serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This proposal for trilateral cooperation was made during a visit to the United States at an older person's invitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

Regarding current [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_challenges_for_russia | diplomatic challenges]], the speaker expresses concern about a lack of clear interlocutors, stating, "with whom to talk there I just don't understand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a> and questioning where guarantees exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

The speaker notes that political decisions in the USA are leading to attempts to limit cooperation with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This is viewed as self-harm, with the speaker stating, "By limiting cooperation with China, you are harming yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

## National Outlook

The speaker refers to Russia as "our beloved country" and a "free fraternal peoples Union" extending from the southern steppes to the Polar region, with "forests and fields are spread out generally free" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This national identity forms the backdrop for Russia's [[international_relations_and_diplomatic_stances_of_kremlin | diplomatic stances]].

Looking towards the future, the speaker acknowledges the transition from the past to the future and the need to move forward to create it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. In the past year, Russia "worked hard and did a lot," was proud of achievements, and "rejoiced in success and were firm in defending the national interest, our freedom and security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. The nation faced "colossal challenges" and learned to live and solve complex problems in harsh conditions due to the "Solidarity of those large-scale goals that society faces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

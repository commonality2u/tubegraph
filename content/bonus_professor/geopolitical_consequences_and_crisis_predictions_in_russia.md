This article outlines expected [[speculation_on_russias_future_political_and_military_actions | political and military actions]], [[russian_economic_issues_and_potential_crises | economic challenges]], and societal impacts anticipated in Russia, particularly after the New Year holidays, according to Valery Solovyov's observations.

## Planned Mobilization and Martial Law
After the New Year holidays, Russia plans a significant mobilization effort, coupled with the expansion of martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00"></a>. This mobilization is expected to be more organized and tougher than previous iterations, declared as a general mobilization rather than partial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00"></a>.

Initial targets suggest mobilizing 300,000 to 500,000 people, with long-term plans potentially reaching up to two million, including 300,000 women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:10"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:12"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00"></a>. Women with military registration specialties, primarily doctors and medical personnel, are expected to be mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00"></a>. Summonses are reportedly ready in Moscow, and those subject to mobilization are being entered into facial recognition databases, including the Moscow Metro's system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00"></a>. Individuals can be approached in Moscow or St. Petersburg metro stations and directed to mobilization points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00"></a>. The guiding slogan for these efforts will be "everything for the front, everything for Victory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00"></a>.

Authorities aim to use this large number of mobilized people to withstand Ukrainian offensives and consolidate Russian defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00"></a>. Doubts exist, however, regarding the authorities' ability to adequately equip and uniform such a large contingent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00"></a>.

### Expansion of Martial Law
Martial law has already been introduced in the "new territories" of the Russian Federation and is expected to extend across all or significant parts of Russia, including Moscow and St. Petersburg, after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00"></a>.

The implications of martial law include:
*   **Labor Mobilization:** The right of authorities to conduct labor mobilization, affecting individuals aged 14 to 65 who were not conscripted into the active army, sending them to work to strengthen the country's defense capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00"></a>.
*   **Property Rights:** The possibility of forced changes in organizational ownership, including nationalization of large corporate and private property, or its transfer to "patriotic hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00"></a>. There is also the possibility of seizing private property with uncertain subsequent compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00"></a>.
*   **Freedom of Information:** Martial law provides for the possibility of restricting freedom of communication and information use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00"></a>. However, YouTube was not blocked previously due to the government's need for its own pro-government YouTubers and bloggers to distribute information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00"></a>.

### Travel Restrictions
A database with up to 7 million people potentially subject to mobilization will be transferred to the border service, preventing them from leaving the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00"></a>. A complete ban on leaving Russia is not expected, but a partial ban for those of mobilization age in the database will be easily implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00"></a>. It is advised against returning to Russia for those wishing to avoid military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00"></a>.

## Economic and Social Impact
### Loans and Mortgages
In the event of general mobilization, a deferment of loan and mortgage payments is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00"></a>. If an individual dies at the front, their family may see debts written off or offered preferential payment terms, a decision that rests primarily with the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00"></a>.

### Financial Assets
Currency deposits in banks are already frozen and forcibly converted to rubles, meaning they can only be withdrawn in rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00"></a>. Banks are expected to cite force majeure circumstances, making it unlikely that original currency deposits can be retrieved in their initial currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00"></a>. Ruble deposits are not threatened as the Central Bank can print as much money as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00"></a>. However, the ruble is expected to depreciate catastrophically during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00"></a>.

For savings, it is advised to keep them in easily movable assets that can be used as a means of payment or exchanged for rubles, primarily dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00"></a>. Gold, particularly scrap gold from pawnshops, is mentioned as an option due to its relative liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00"></a>.

### Property and Investments
Selling apartments and cars at below-market prices to withdraw funds from Russia depends on personal strategy and future plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00"></a>. While assets are currently depreciating, they are expected to grow eventually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00"></a>. However, for those in border regions like Belgorod, it might be advisable to sell housing assets due to escalating tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00"></a>.

### Government Spending
Financing for government procurement, repairs, and reconstruction in the social sphere will likely be reduced, while spending on the defense industry will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00"></a>.

### Pension Reform
The pension reform (increase in retirement age) is unlikely to be canceled, despite being viewed as a proper step to compensate people for lost pension payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00"></a>. The country's anticipated state of mass poverty and meager budget will make it impossible to afford such compensation in the foreseeable future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00"></a>. However, the issue of compensation should be raised, potentially from oil and gas revenues, even as these revenues decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00"></a>.

### Food Supply
While severe food shortages are not expected next year, some disruptions related to logistics may occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00"></a>. Some regions are preparing for the introduction of food rationing or food cards, not due to scarcity, but to provide access to cheap provisions for socially vulnerable groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00"></a>.

## [[prospects_of_political_crisis_and_potential_changes_in_russian_governance | Political Crisis and Future Outlook]]
### Instability and Uncertainty
The current situation is characterized by the highest uncertainty, with the health of the president being a key variable that could lead to sudden collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00"></a>. The next year is predicted to be harder than 2022, requiring a period of deterioration before improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00"></a>. This period of [[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_russia | disorganization and chaos]] may make the 1990s seem like a faint reflection of what is to come <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00"></a>. The impact will be contextual, with some areas experiencing more severe conditions than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00"></a>.

### Public Sentiment and Protest Potential
Polls conducted by federal security services, which the highest authorities rely on, show Putin's rating much lower than official sociological agencies report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00"></a>. The readiness of Russian women to protest is gradually growing, contrary to official reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00"></a>. The protest potential of Russian society is assessed as quite high, evidenced by individual surges of manifestations like the arson of military enlistment offices (which have since ceased due to increased guarding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00"></a>. This potential is actively suppressed by authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00"></a>.

### Predictions of Crisis and Revolution
Political analysis methods predict a [[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_russia | political crisis in Russia]] with high accuracy (85-100% in the medium term of 6-8 months), making it practically inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00"></a>. While revolution is a form of crisis development and resolution, no one can predict if or when a revolution will occur, as analytical capabilities for such predictions do not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00"></a>.

### Succession of Power
The forecasts for a transition of power are considered compatible with the preparation for a long war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00"></a>. Vladimir (Putin) reportedly desires to conclude the "special military operation" in his favor before handing over authority to individuals like Patrushev, seeking an honorable exit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00"></a>. It is uncertain whether the breakdown of his physiological capabilities or the escalation strategy will occur faster, or if his inner circle will decide to isolate him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00"></a>.

### Societal Change
Societal change is expected to be driven by a shift in framework rather than a modification of people's consciousness initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00"></a>. If state propaganda ceases, people are expected to gradually "come to their senses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00"></a>. Providing a creative perspective and opportunities for people to live and develop will be crucial for societal rehabilitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00"></a>.

## [[geopolitical_tensions_and_russias_international_relationships | Geopolitical Tensions and Conflict Dynamics]]
### Ukraine's Counter-Strategy
To counter Russia's goals of destroying Ukraine's energy sector, Ukraine can:
*   **Pressure Western Countries:** Urge Western allies to provide more modern, long-range weapons and ammunition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00"></a>.
*   **Successful Offensive:** Conduct a successful offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00"></a>.
*   **Strike Russian Infrastructure:** If sufficient long-range weapons are received, strike Russian infrastructure, potentially expanding beyond border regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00"></a>.

### Nuclear Weapons and Escalation
The probability of the Kremlin using nuclear weapons, including tactical ones, exists and is not zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00"></a>. The decision for nuclear use is believed to have been made by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, who has not been dissuaded by American warnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00"></a>. This action might occur if the situation on the fronts for Russian forces becomes "completely lousy," or if general mobilization fails or proves counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00"></a>. There is a chance (also not zero) that the President's own entourage might prevent him from implementing such an order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00"></a>.

Regarding NATO and China's response:
*   **NATO Response:** The West has promised a retaliatory strike with conventional weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00"></a>. If Russia uses tactical nuclear weapons, NATO is prepared to respond with conventional force, potentially escalating the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00"></a>. If, for example, Russia's Black Sea Fleet suffers critically from a conventional Western strike, the Russian President might feel compelled to respond with massive tactical nuclear weapons use, given Russia's conventional weapon limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00"></a>.
*   **European vs. American Readiness:** Europeans might be hesitant due to the fear of escalation and suffering direct consequences, but the Americans and Britain are ready for such a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00"></a>. Putin's hope that these countries would retreat in the face of such a threat appears unfounded, similar to their response on February 24, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00"></a>.

### Bomb Shelters
The preparation of bomb shelters in Moscow and other cities is not primarily for nuclear war, but for possible shelling from Ukraine, as some cities in the European part of Russia may fall within the range of weapons received by Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00"></a>.

### Kazakhstan's Future
No prerequisites for war are seen in Kazakhstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00"></a>. Its future critically depends on the ability of President Tokayev's ruling group to at least partially implement announced reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00"></a>.

### Western Treatment of Russians
The West is largely pragmatic and is not expected to massively favor Russians designated as terrorists or extremists by the Russian regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:48:00"></a>. Generally, the West treats Russians with restrained negativity or, at best, restrained neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:58:00"></a>.

### Occult and Mystical Interests in Russian Leadership
The President of the Russian Federation is not connected with Masons, but he reportedly has an interest in occult and mystical plots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00"></a>. Information from sources like "Insider" (declared banned or hostile in Russia) suggests the use of "combat magic," psychics, and astrologers within structures like the Federal Security Service, with a deputy director known by the nickname "Stargazer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00"></a>.

### Global Experiment Theory
The idea that current events, including the war, are part of a global experiment on humanity beginning with the coronavirus in 2019, is not supported. Such sequences of misfortunes have historically occurred, often in pairs of major tragedies, without necessarily implying malicious intent or a global experiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00"></a>.

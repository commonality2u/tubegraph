The current state and future [[Reforms and future strategies for Russias governance and social systems | reform prospects]] of Russian special services were discussed in a joint stream on February 18th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The discussion included an assessment of their professionalism and potential for change, within the broader context of the [[Russian political situation and governance issues | political situation in Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Current State of Russian Special Services

There is a widespread opinion that the Russian special services are "very degraded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. This view is often based on incidents such as the Skripal poisoning and the perceived failure of the [[Russian Federal Security Service revelations | Alexei Navalny poisoning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. However, this degradation is attributed more to "stupid groups of people" rather than the entire special services apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:14">[01:02:14]</a>.

Despite these instances, Russian special services are considered "quite professionally" capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:25">[01:01:25]</a>. It is suggested that if the "criminal component" (murders, special operations, hybrid warfare) is removed, these services could be put to use for "eliminating threats external and internal real threats" rather than fighting the opposition or engaging in crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a>. Historically, they have been ranked among the top three special services globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>.

## Prospects for Reform

The potential for [[Reforms and future strategies for Russias governance and social systems | reform]] within Russian special services is considered undoubtedly possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>. The experience of Georgia, where Mikheil Saakashvili carried out significant [[Reforms and rehabilitation in Russian governance | reforms]] to the special services and police, is cited as an example of what can be achieved in a "fairly short time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>. This example demonstrated that work could be done effectively without a "corruption component" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:08">[00:59:08]</a>.

### Key Areas for Reform

The primary area for [[Reforms and future strategies for Russias governance and social systems | reform]] should begin with a "complete lustration of the entire judicial corps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:38">[00:59:38]</a>. Once [[Russian legal and penal system reforms | judicial reform]] is carried out and new judges are recruited from professional lawyers and researchers, further [[Reforms and future strategies for Russias governance and social systems | reform]] of the special services can proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. The overall [[Russian government restructuring | restructuring]] and improvement are deemed achievable in "quite short terms" from a historical perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>.

### Impact of Putin's Health

The health factor of President Putin "very seriously affects" many government decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:17">[01:15:17]</a>. The leadership of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the FSB, and even the armed forces reportedly consider his health when making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:11">[01:16:11]</a>. The guarantees offered by a "sick dying person" are perceived as "not equal to 0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>, implying a potential shift in loyalty or willingness among these entities to support or undertake [[Reforms and future strategies for Russias governance and social systems | reforms]].

## Role in Political Transition

A crucial element for significant [[Potential government reforms and policies in Russia | changes in Russia]] is a "split in the elites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. The activities of those seeking change are explicitly aimed at fostering this split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This involves interfering with the plans of the current leadership, such as influencing the timing of elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. For example, early presidential elections were reportedly planned for April but have been postponed, along with the President's message to the Federal Assembly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>.

The authorities are perceived as making "all possible mistakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>, which is recognized even by "the most sophisticated observers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. These mistakes, coupled with anticipated rigged elections, are expected to serve as a "serious enough trigger" for the protest movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. The ultimate goal is to "change this system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>, asserting that there "should not be criminals in the region" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>.

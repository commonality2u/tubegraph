This article, based on insights from Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, discusses the importance of personal and financial preparedness in times of instability, particularly concerning potential future [[mobilization_strategies_and_preparations | mobilization]] and [[potential_economic_crisis_and_freeze_on_deposits_and_accounts | economic challenges]]. It emphasizes a shift from wishful thinking to a sensible and impartial view of reality, stressing the need for personal responsibility and a strong "will to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

## Psychological Preparedness and Social Maturity

The speaker addresses the "psychological reaction" of some viewers to difficult news, noting that some find it a "nightmare" and struggle to sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. He categorizes such reactions as "infantile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Instead, he advocates for "social maturity," which means people should strive to look at events "sensibly and impartially without trying to take wishful thinking for reality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. It's crucial to "accept the truth," no matter how unpleasant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

> "If you try to shield yourself from it, this means that your behavior and your infantile That is, you behave and think yourself Yes, you think yourself, including as teenagers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>

The speaker's aim in sharing information is twofold:
1.  To influence decision-making by spreading awareness, hoping that "the Supreme Authority will hesitate before making this decision" or implement it less severely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.
2.  To allow individuals to prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

## The Will to Live and Personal Responsibility

The speaker views the public's attitude toward [[mobilization_strategies_and_preparations | mobilization]] as a "general national test" of intelligence and the "will to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. He emphasizes taking "responsibility for their behavior and their actions" rather than "pushing this responsibility onto anyone," especially the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

### Avoiding False Hope and State Dependency
Individuals should not rely on state compensation or support if they participate in conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. The speaker asserts that compensation for those who "gave his life defending the homeland" will be difficult to obtain, likening it to receiving only a "coffin with a discount" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>.

> "If you, receiving a summons for [[mobilization_strategies_and_preparations | mobilization]] for your family and friends or for yourself, begin to obediently stupidly repeat what should we do, this means from my point of view only one thing You have a weakened survival instinct, not even logic, the survival instinct, because the one who wants to live seeks opportunities to survive first to survive and then to win" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>

This highlights the importance of the "survival instinct" and "will to live" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

## [[Strategies for overcoming economic challenges | Financial Implications of Mobilization]] and Preparedness

The speaker strongly advises securing cash, as the Russian banking and financial system is expected to "collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:39:00">[20:39:00]</a>.

> "It is specifically good to have cash because it was not without reason that I already said about databases I said many times that counting those who are subject to [[mobilization_strategies_and_preparations | mobilization]] can also be blocked Therefore if you have a supply of cash And other money will be brought to the fit of your relatives and friends on the card then this will be correct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:09:00">[20:09:00]</a>

He suggests that while essential goods like vodka and food will likely remain available, there will be a "shortage of what is called money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:04:00">[21:04:00]</a>. Currency (dollars, euros) will become the true form of money, and even if banned, a "fabulously black market" will emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>.

## Practical Preparations for [[Preserving life health and property during unstable times | Preserving Life, Health, and Property]]

Based on past [[mobilization_strategies_and_preparations | mobilization]] experiences, the speaker suggests that families will need to provide essential gear themselves.

> "You want to increase the chances of survival means the family will fall into debt will take out loans in order to provide for their only child or their husband to feed no not in order to save in order to simply increase the chances so that he does not die immediately and will provide him with clothing and shoes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a>

This implies a need for personal savings or the willingness to incur debt to acquire necessary items like clothing, shoes, and bulletproof vests, as the state may not adequately supply them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.

## Importance of Information Dissemination

The speaker reiterates the importance of spreading information as a form of preparedness: "the more people know and see the better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>. This acts as a collective form of preparedness and potentially influences official decisions, helping to prevent the worst outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the speaker urges individuals to think sensibly, accept reality, and take responsibility for their lives. He advises focusing on self-preservation, financial readiness, and ensuring practical provisions, as the state may not provide adequate support. The overall message is to utilize "intellect" and the "will to live" to make informed decisions and "fight for your only life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a>.

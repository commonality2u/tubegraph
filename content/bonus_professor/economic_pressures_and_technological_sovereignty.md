The Kremlin is employing [[nuclear_threats_and_economic_sanctions | economic blackmail]] as an instrument of [[future_political_changes_and_the_role_of_international_relations | foreign policy]], specifically targeting Europe to pressure Ukraine into negotiations on Russian terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:07">[06:10:07]</a>. This strategy involves gas blackmail, which is described as "quite successful," and leveraging [[economic_and_political_challenges_in_russia | economic problems]] exacerbated by rising energy prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:04">[06:34:04]</a>. These [[economic_issues_and_crisis_preparation | economic problems]] are intended to cause domestic political crises in European countries, such as the one observed in Italy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:08">[06:40:08]</a>.

At the same time, Russia is preparing for a long confrontation, which includes the idea of a "besieged fortress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:03">[10:17:03]</a>.

## Pursuit of Technological Sovereignty

A key aspect of this long-term strategy is the declared shift from a market economy to a strategy of "technological sovereignty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:03">[10:36:03]</a>. This concept is interpreted as the "poetics of isolationism" and an effort to achieve self-sufficiency by establishing a domestic base for the production of high-tech goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:03">[10:49:03]</a>.

While some countries like North Korea and Iran have achieved technological sovereignty, North Korea's technological development level is noted as being comparable to the USSR of the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:03">[11:11:03]</a>. The speaker expresses doubt that technological sovereignty is attainable for Russia, citing "extremely serious limitations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:03">[11:39:03]</a>.

Denis Manturov has been appointed Vice-Premier responsible for import substitution and is now tasked with achieving technological sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:07">[11:48:07]</a>.

### Challenges with Import Substitution

Past results of [[economic_challenges_in_russia | import substitution policy]] have been largely unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:04">[11:58:04]</a>. In May 2022, significant declines in production were observed across various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:07">[12:07:07]</a>:
*   Car production collapsed by 97% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:03">[12:11:03]</a>.
*   Passenger buses by 77% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:03">[12:14:03]</a>.
*   Diesel locomotives by 63% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:07">[12:17:07]</a>.
*   Washing machines by 59% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:04">[12:21:04]</a>.
*   Refrigerators by 58% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:06">[12:24:06]</a>.
*   Freight cars by 52% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:06">[12:25:06]</a>.
*   Passenger cars by 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:09">[12:28:09]</a>.

The speaker suggests that the pursuit of technological sovereignty will likely yield similar results to import substitution, with immense sums of money being spent with no tangible outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:03">[12:34:03]</a>.

Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, in its 44th program recorded on Sunday, December 18, and released on Monday, December 19, discussed the potential for [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law|resumption of mobilization]] and the introduction of elements of [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law|martial law]] in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This transformation aims to turn Russia into a military camp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Signs of Imminent Changes

According to the program, there are clear signs that a second stage of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation|mobilization]] and the imposition of [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law|martial law]] are not isolated incidents but emerging trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>. Predictions made months ago by figures like Andrey Valevich <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a> and "Spaceman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a> suggested a second stage of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation|mobilization]] would begin in the last ten days of December, starting in a "relatively gentle form" like document verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

Evidence from social media shows people receiving offers or invitations to military registration and enlistment offices for "verification of documents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

### Increased Military Service Term

A recent scandal involved Lieutenant Colonel Fotin, a Moscow region military commissar, stating that the term of military service would increase from one year to one and a half or even two years starting in the spring of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Although this information spread rapidly through social networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, Putin publicly denied it, claiming Fotin's statement was from two years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>. Putin also clarified that [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation|mobilization]] had been suspended, not stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. Despite the denial, it is believed that Fotin's statement reflects general knowledge, as military commissars have received instructions to prepare for an increase in military service length and a second stage of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation|mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

### Extension of Martial Law and Travel Restrictions

The second stage of [[mobilization_in_the_russian_federation|mobilization]] is likely to be associated with extending [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law|martial law]] to the entire territory of Russia or a significant part of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. This could include restrictions on travel abroad and even movement between subjects of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

Over the past week, employees of large corporations like Rostec and Rosneft, along with their families, have been prohibited from leaving Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Top management of Rosneft has even been advised not to leave Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. This is seen as a test or an actual introduction of elements of [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law|martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.

## Implications for Citizens and Economy

The current situation is compared to a "secondary vision of serfdom," where everyone, including the nobility, serves the state, leading to attachment to one's service place and bureaucratic bans on movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. Exceptions are expected for "especially trusted oprichniks," primarily security forces and officers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

### Mobilization Economy and Asset Redistribution

If [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law|martial law]] is introduced, a logical next step is a mobilization economy, where individuals are attached to their workplaces and cannot quit or move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. Additionally, a redistribution of assets is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. Assets from "wrong oligarchs" (those critical of the state or unwilling to surrender capital for victory) may be transferred to the state or "right oligarchs" who are considered patriots but have suffered losses from sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

While there are no current plans for nationalizing small and medium-sized businesses, regional security agency heads may target profitable ones, potentially fabricating criminal cases to seize control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>.

### Ideological Pumping and Public Response

The concept of a "people's war," proposed by a head of the presidential administration, may become the core of agitation and propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. However, recent sociology suggests this approach may not be effective or could even have a negative impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. TV viewers have reportedly stopped watching propaganda talk shows, opting for entertainment content instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. This indicates public fatigue with official propaganda and a desire to forget the bloody confrontation in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

In October, the top 100 TV programs included five propaganda talk shows, with Vladimir Solovyov's show ranking seventh in July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. However, in the most recent week of study by Mediascope, only Skabeeva and Popov's show made the top 100, while others like Solovyov's were entirely outside the rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. This makes it doubtful that television can effectively convey the "people's war" concept to society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>.

### Suppression of Protests

The authorities anticipate potential resistance to a more massive second stage of [[mobilization_and_the_state_of_the_russian_army|mobilization]]. Lessons learned from women's riots in Dagestan and Yakutia have led to preliminary orders for security forces to "mercilessly suppress" women's protests, echoing the historical phrase, "Do not fire blanks, do not spare the bullets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

### Decreased Incomes and Economic Hardship

The program suggests that Putin is fighting the poor, as many disappear in the "fog of war" through [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_russia|mobilization]] and may not return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. Sociology indicates that 70% of Russian citizens reduced their expenses in the third quarter of the year, saving on clothes, eating out, or household items, and increasingly refusing vacations and new electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. Ahead of the New Year, people plan to buy fewer and cheaper gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>. Even those with money are saving for a potential "black day," anticipating that the situation will worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.

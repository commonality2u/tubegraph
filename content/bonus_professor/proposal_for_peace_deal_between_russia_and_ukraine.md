On November 11, an emergency report detailed an significant [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | offer of a peace deal]] with Ukraine that was received by the [[kremlins_perception_of_peace_with_ukraine | Kremlin]] on Thursday, November 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace proposal]], which has been agreed upon with the [[ukraine_russia_peace_talks_and_territorial_integrity | Ukrainian leadership]], is presented as a proposal for the capitulation of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The information regarding this proposal was received and confirmed simultaneously from multiple trustworthy sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Conditions of the Proposal

The essence of the [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | proposal]] includes several key demands and conditions:

*   **Withdrawal from Ukraine** The Russian armed forces must completely leave Ukraine, including the territories of the DPR and LPR, which Russia had previously declared as subjects of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Crimea's Status** The status of Crimea is to be suspended for seven years, during which it will not be discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The peninsula would be declared a demilitarized zone, allowing only police and border guards with small arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The Black Sea Fleet must also leave Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Demilitarized Border Strip** A 100-kilometer wide demilitarized strip is to be introduced on the borders of Russia with Ukraine and Belarus, with no heavy weapons allowed in this strip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This rule would primarily apply to exclude Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Guarantor Countries** Six countries have reportedly consented to act as guarantors of this agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Transnistria** Russia must leave Transnistria, meaning the Russian military base there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. In 2023, Transnistria would be integrated into Moldova, with Russia undertaking not to interfere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Ukraine and NATO** In return, Ukraine promises not to join NATO for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Reactions to the Proposal

### Russian Establishment
The initial reaction from the Russian establishment to this [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | "ultimatum"]] or [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | "offer of capitulation"]] has been positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This is because the proposal guarantees freedom and security for the establishment, including security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. It is guaranteed that criminal cases will not be brought against them or their family members, and they will not be persecuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The preservation of at least part of their assets is also implied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

### President Putin
President Putin's reaction is currently unclear; he is reportedly "thinking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

#### Signs of Acceptance or Refusal
*   **Refusal** If massive missile attacks on [[ukraine_and_western_countries_challenges_in_negotiating_peace_with_russia | Ukrainian]] critical infrastructure, particularly power plants, are resumed, it signifies an unambiguous refusal of the conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Continued Reflection** If there is no shelling, it does not necessarily mean readiness to accept, but rather that reflection continues, and an attempt is being made to gain additional time to comprehend the situation, hoping for a miracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Potential Consequences

### If Putin Refuses
If Putin refuses the conditions that the Russian establishment is ready to accept, the [[prospects_for_ending_the_russiaukraine_conflict | military action]] will continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. A military defeat of the Russian Federation is then considered highly probable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The only way for Putin to delay this defeat is through a nuclear threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. However, the chances increase that an order to use tactical nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction would be blocked or not carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Such an event would effectively mean the end of Vladimir Putin's de facto presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### If Putin Accepts
If Putin accepts the [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | ultimatum]], he would have to go into the shadows to save face and shift responsibility to another person who would sign this "shameful agreement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This scenario carries the risk of a palace coup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Imminent Fiasco
> Regardless of the strategic decision, President Putin will inevitably have to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. If he continues the [[prospects_for_ending_the_russiaukraine_conflict | military campaign]], he will become a scapegoat for its defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
>
> The acceptance of these conditions would signify a sharp turn in Russian politics, both internationally and internally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This would mean a complete and final fiasco of 22 years of Putin's rule, his policies, and the Putin system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. A historical analogy is drawn to Russia's defeat in the Crimean War (1853-1856), where Emperor Nicholas I, who initially believed in his army's victory, effectively caused his own death after realizing the defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

Valery Solovey presents the 46th episode of his program, offering reflections on the coming year 2023 [00:00:30]. He expresses a gloomy feeling that the phrase "Today we are alive and this is our happiness" might become the motto for 2023, rather than just a New Year's joke [00:01:04]. This outlook is influenced by his viewing of President Vladimir Putin's New Year's address [00:01:30].

## The Outlook for 2023: Severe Trials and Mobilization
Putin's address is described as a "clot of negative emotions" from a man with a "face distorted with pain and hatred," promising "severe trials" and predicting 2023 will be a year of "military action" [00:01:48]. This is not seen as a typical New Year's wish [00:02:08].

In preparation for these actions, a bill was in its third reading in the State Duma on the eve of the New Year, legally enabling mobilization summons to be served by registered mail with notification [00:02:31]. This means that receiving notification of a registered letter at the post office is considered a legal summons for mobilization once signed for [00:02:49]. Even refusing to take the letter from the postman results in the summons being considered handed over [00:03:33]. Solovey advises that any notice of a registered letter at the start of the year is "not a letter of happiness" but a call to "fulfill your patriotic duty" [00:04:01].

## Lessons from 2022 and Optics for the Future
Solovey shares personal lessons learned from 2022, which he believes hold "public interest" [00:04:49]. While many of these thoughts are "sad," some "paradoxically" hold "sprouts of some hope" [00:05:10]. He defines these lessons as "cold observations" and "sorrowful notes," which also serve as "optics" to examine the future, specifically what awaits in 2023 [00:05:44].

### Lesson 1: Misunderstanding Society
Yuri Andropov's statement, "we do not know the Society in which we live," is considered "absolute" in relation to [[social_and_intellectual_dynamics_in_modern_russian_society | modern Russian society]] [00:06:27]. Many Russians have been "surprised" by the behavior of their compatriots over the past year, indicating a lack of true understanding of their society [00:06:44].

Two fundamental factors contribute to this misunderstanding:
*   **Inaccuracy and falsification of data:** Sociology and statistics in Russia are deeply rooted in falsification, to the point where the authorities themselves struggle to know the real figures [00:07:06]. For example, in 2019, the Russian leadership could not get accurate data on voting for the ruling party because the falsification system was "so ramified, multi-level and ingrained" [00:07:29].
*   **Intellectual weakness:** The intellectual class, especially those professionally engaged in analysis, are often "not able to understand what is literally before our eyes and draw conclusions" [00:08:06]. Solzhenitsyn's phrase "communism in plain sight" is echoed by Solovey regarding the "Putin system," which has "always been in plain sight before us" [00:08:42].

### Lesson 2: Intellectual Weakness and its Defects
[[social_and_intellectual_dynamics_in_modern_russian_society | Intellectual weakness]] is further broken down into two defects of the "domestic mentality" [00:09:29]:
*   **Poor knowledge of domestic history:** [[historical_interpretation_and_its_influence_on_current_events | Historical analogies]] are deemed "incomparably more accurate" than extrapolation (extending the present into the future) as a method of forecasting [00:09:39]. Understanding historical precedents is crucial, especially in a crisis, to comprehend how it will develop [00:10:11]. Solovey plans an open lecture to demonstrate how historical analogies work [00:10:46].
*   **Very weak imagination:** Imagination is not an opposite to analysis but a prerequisite for it [00:11:10]. To "know" and "think," one must imagine that "the boundaries of knowledge do not exist" and be ready for "unimaginable" things [00:11:40]. The political class and Russian intellectuals lack the imagination to conceive of "another Russia" or to fully understand the current regime [00:12:12]. Saxo Bank's "outrageous forecasts" serve as an example of expanding intellectual frameworks and promoting flexibility [00:12:36]. Solovey notes the need for a "Devil's Advocate" â€” someone who questions assumptions and imagines the worst-case scenarios, a role he believes he has played [00:13:07].

#### Understanding Russian Power
Russian society, including the ruling class, is described as incapable of imagining the "true nature of Russian power" [00:14:03]. As an example, Dmitry Medvedev's plane reportedly made ten trips outside Russia in the two months leading up to the New Year, twice visiting Kathmandu, Nepal [00:14:19]. These visits were allegedly tied to attempts to find an entrance to the mythical Shambhala, based on an adviser's belief [00:14:49]. This is described as at least the third such attempt, with "tens of millions of dollars" having been spent without success [00:15:21]. This anecdote highlights the "unthinkable" aspects of the Russian regime.

### Lesson 3: Societal Adaptability
Russian society is characterized as "very flexible and highly adaptive" [00:15:48]. While this adaptability allows society to survive, it is also a weakness because it "very quickly historically instantly gets used to the bad" and "begins to endure the unbearable" [00:15:53].

### Lesson 4: Moralism and Lack of Distinction Between Good and Evil
This lesson is described as the "other side" of plasticity [00:16:21]. Solovey speaks of "moralism" rather than morality, signifying a state "beyond good and evil," echoing Nietzsche [00:16:30]. He states that while Russians are "very capable people," they are "capable of literally everything" [00:16:41]. A significant portion of the population struggles to distinguish between good and evil, making them "moral to them they are not spheres of morality" [00:16:51]. This means they can be led "to a goat and to good" with equal success, and currently, a significant part of society "submissively fatalistic submissively follows the path" without internal resistance [00:17:17].

### Lesson 5: Contradictory Mental State
The [[the_psychology_and_consequences_of_consensus_and_dissent_in_russian_society | mental state of Russian society]] is "extremely contradictory" [00:17:39]. It exhibits both deep depression and apathy, alongside agitation and a high readiness for aggression [00:17:43]. These "swings" can rapidly intensify [00:18:03]. Despite this, there is a "deep need to return to normal," as people recognize their current state as "deeply abnormal" [00:18:17]. Solovey believes that once these negative emotions and aggression are "splashed out on a global scale," people may then move in a direction "directly opposite to the current" [00:18:31]. Citing a Chinese phrase, "people grass rulers wind," he suggests that wherever the wind (rulers) blows, the people will follow [00:19:09].

### Lesson 6: The Stability and Potential of the Russian Economy
The Russian economy has demonstrated "very stable" over the past year, undergoing "degradation" but still "standing and is holding up" [00:19:32]. This stability suggests that it is "capable of rapid growth" [00:19:51]. Solovey does not believe the Russian economy will collapse due to "mistakes, crimes, sanctions" [00:20:15]. Instead, he predicts it can "very quickly recover and begin to develop very quickly if we stop interfering" [00:20:25].

### Lesson 7: Competent Personnel Serving Evil
[[role_of_digital_control_and_societal_changes | Final stability]] in Russia was ensured last year by "competent efforts by senior government officials, bureaucrats" [00:20:51]. This is "good news" that such qualified personnel exist [00:21:05]. The "bad news" is that these people "serve evil," which is further proof of the "moralism" described earlier [00:21:17]. These officials are no different from the average Russian in their "conformism" and could potentially "go over to the right side of history" and serve a "good cause" [00:21:37].

Regarding the financial system, Solovey notes conflicting forecasts from respected economists: one predicting stability due to "competent efforts of bureaucrats," and another predicting the "inevitable bankruptcy of the ruble" [00:22:01]. He suggests that the outcome depends on whether "political factors interfere" with economic and financial processes, and he believes the chances of such destructive interference in 2023 are "much much higher" than in 2022 [00:22:33].

## Conclusion
Solovey concludes by urging listeners to take care of themselves, their health, and their nervous systems, emphasizing that self-care will be an "imperative" in 2023 [00:24:06]. He expresses commitment to continue being with his audience and believes 2023 will be the year to "change our destiny" [00:24:21]. He encourages preparing for this and to "firmly know, do not doubt victory will be ours" [00:24:42].

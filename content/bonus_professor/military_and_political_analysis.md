Valery Solovyov, a doctor of historical sciences, political analyst, and public figure, discussed the [[military_and_political_situation_in_ukraine | military and political situation in Ukraine]] on April 18, 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. He noted that the armed conflict between Russia and Ukraine has become the main nerve of Russian politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>, influencing everything happening in Russia and what will happen in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

## Approaching the Culmination of the Conflict

The confrontation appears to be approaching its culmination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

### Reasons for Culmination
From the Russian side, the Kremlin has failed to achieve any of its combat missions or political goals set at the beginning of its campaign against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. The unexplained loss of the cruiser Varyag and the lack of public information on casualties have raised questions about the operation's effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. The Russian leadership urgently needs a strategic turning point on the front lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

On the Ukrainian side, there is a strong resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. Ukraine, supported by the West, refuses to meet Russia's ultimatum demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. The West publicly states that the fate of peace talks will be decided on the battlefield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. Ukraine believes it can inflict significant damage on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

### Signs of Culmination
Russian troops are concentrating in Donbas, aiming to create a "cauldron" for the Ukrainian armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Concurrently, the West is rapidly supplying complex and strike weapons to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. The Battle of Donbas is considered a key event of the confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. Despite this, information from the most senior Russian military suggests a lack of confidence in victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

## High Risk of Escalation

The confrontation is expected to be extremely fierce, with symptoms of bitterness evident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. The risk of escalation is very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

### Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction
If the Kremlin fails to achieve its [[military_operations_and_strategic_goals | military operations and strategic goals]]—forcing Ukraine to sign a peace treaty on favorable terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>—the risks of using weapons of mass destruction (WMD) increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. This includes low-yield tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>. The possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons is constantly discussed and confirmed by various Western sources, including American military and intelligence, such as the head of the CIA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.

WMDs also imply chemical and bacteriological weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. Russian and self-proclaimed republics' defense representatives hint that Ukrainians may commit provocations or possess chemical weapons, which are seen as transparent hints about a potential escalation mechanism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

### Interrupting Logistics Chains
Given Ukraine's effective resistance due to Western weapon supplies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>, there is a temptation to interrupt these logistical chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. A strike using tactical nuclear weapons could occur on Ukrainian territory or a neighboring country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>; however, no decision has been made on this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

### Attacks on Russian Territory
Another escalation mechanism involves the Ukrainian side striking military and civilian targets within Russian regions adjacent to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. Ukraine is expected to receive missiles capable of reaching Russian military airfields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

### Terrorist Attacks
A further trigger for escalation could be terrorist attacks in Moscow and other large Russian cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. Hints of this have appeared in official Russian media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

### Comparison to Cuban Missile Crisis
The world is in a situation very reminiscent of the Cuban Missile Crisis, perhaps even more acute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.

## Future Scenarios for the Conflict
Assuming the most dangerous option of escalation is avoided, there are three possibilities for further developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>:

1.  **Peace Treaty**: A peace treaty seems unlikely due to the Ukrainian side's position and Russia's "unrealizable" demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
2.  **Truce**: A cessation of hostilities, either partial or full <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.
3.  **Continuation of Sluggish Military Actions**: This involves a truce followed by positional battles or ongoing [[military_operations and strategic goals | military actions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>. This state could last at least until the fall of 2022, possibly longer, with American sources suggesting until the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.

## Internal Russian Political Dynamics

When expectations fail, subordinates are blamed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>. The failure of the initial concept of a "limited military operation" has led to blame being placed on those close to the president who provided misleading information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.

### Elite Purges and Disorganization
Minister of Defense Shoigu has fallen into disgrace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:07:00">[12:07:00]</a>. The former head of the 5th service of the FSB, responsible for operational information on Ukraine and behind-the-scenes preparation, is in a pre-trial detention center, allegedly subjected to physical abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>. A group of officers from his department are also giving confessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. Problems also exist within the Main Directorate of the General Staff (military intelligence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.

There is no widespread conspiracy or split in the elite, but rather tension and disorganization among the security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>. This will likely increase, as a purge will occur once the special military operation ends, with culprits identified and punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>.

### Economic Impact and Nationalization
Tension and disorganization will also increase among the top bureaucracy and big business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>. This is due to the impending purge and the strengthening of sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a>. Sanctions will become increasingly sensitive and difficult for the Russian economy, leading to a lower level of technological development and overall degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>.

Conversations among the security environment and those close to the Russian president suggest the nationalization of large private assets and corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a>.

### Signs of De-Sovereignization
There are barely noticeable signs of the "de-sovereignization" of the security forces, characterized by fears and confusion among the highest elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:08:00">[16:08:00]</a>. They recognize the situation will worsen, and a "very sad outcome" awaits this elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:00">[16:22:00]</a>. This parallels the Russian Empire's experience before World War I, where a similar process of "dukhatization" (de-sovereignization) occurred over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:00">[16:45:00]</a>. The current path to de-sovereignization is expected to be much faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>.

While the authorities are trying to "tighten the screws" and prevent this process, a rusty structure with rotten threads will crumble when tightened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a>. The structure of the Russian government is not yet crumbling, but there is a mass feeling of the exhaustion of the "Putin era" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:00">[17:45:00]</a>. This era is ending, likely not triumphantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>.

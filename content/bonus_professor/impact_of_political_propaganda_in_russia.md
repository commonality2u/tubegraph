The current situation in Russia, as observed on March 6, 2022, is likened to a real-world implementation of George Orwell's dystopian novel *1984*, where "War is Peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>. This phenomenon, dubbed "Orwellism" or "idiocy bypassing," describes the prevalent state of information in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## Manifestations of Orwellism

Several examples highlight the pervasive nature of what is described as "Orwellism" in Russian public discourse:
*   **Fake Speeches** President Putin's speech to the female flight crew was identified as a fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This is notable given the strict punishments for spreading "fakes" regarding the armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
*   **Patriarch Kirill's Statement** Patriarch Kirill, head of the Orthodox Church, stated that the people of Donbas rebelled against imposed values, primarily against gay parades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
*   **Biological Laboratories Claims** The leader of the Communist Party, Zyuganov, claimed that Ukraine hosts 15 biological laboratories developing viruses and bacteria harmful to the "Russian world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## Official Stance and Skepticism

Russia's president does not intend to halt operations in Ukraine until Ukraine lays down its arms and accepts the Kremlin's conditions, implying an unconditional surrender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. This would likely be rebranded as a "peace treaty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

Regarding the introduction of martial law, the president stated it is not planned for "today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. However, skepticism is advised due to the president's past broken promises, such as not raising the retirement age or changing the constitution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. A key caveat to the martial law statement was "if suddenly they do not attack us," with the interpretation of what constitutes an "attack" being solely at the discretion of the Russian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

## Public Support and Propaganda Analysis

The speaker believes that President Putin perceives public support for the military operation in Ukraine as a carte blanche for the toughest actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

### Official Sociology vs. Reality
According to a government sociological agency, 71% of Russians support the military operation, 21% are against, and 8% are undecided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. However, the reliability of government agencies on sensitive political information is questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. The 21% opposition represents every fifth citizen, and the 8% undecided are likely fearful to express their true opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>. People in Russia are intimidated and give "socially approved answers," meaning they say what they believe the authorities want to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Therefore, the supposed majority support is considered illusory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

### The Spiral of Silence and Propaganda Techniques
[[impact_of_propaganda_on_russian_society | Propaganda]] aims to create a "spiral of silence," a situation where a perceived minority position (or one held by those with doubts) is suppressed by the impression of an overwhelming majority opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. This tactic is used to foster a feeling of correctness among supporters and predetermination, hopelessness, and deep depression among opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.

Key techniques used by [[state_propaganda_and_media_influence_in_russia | propaganda]] to form this desired "picture of the world" include:
*   **Magic of Numbers** People are more likely to believe statements reinforced with statistics, such as the 71% support figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.
*   **Expert Commentary** State media features "quasi-experts" and a "friendly chorus of approval" from various positions, paid to express opinions that align with the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
*   **Voices from the Ground** This involves orchestrated public speeches, letters of support from regional and municipal officials, and symbolic actions like children from hospices lining up in the shape of the letter 'Z' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.
*   **Repetition** Phrases like "where have you been eight years" are constantly repeated to fill people's minds with [[media_manipulation_and_political_narratives_in_russia | propaganda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>.
*   **Awakening Strong Emotions** [[propaganda_and_public_sentiment_in_russia | Propaganda]] plays on powerful emotions like compassion and anger, often showing footage of suffering, especially involving children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>.

## Fragility of the Consensus and Future Prospects

The authorities' decision to close all alternative sources of information, sites, and media, and to silence opinion leaders, reveals that the supposed national consensus is "very fragile" and "unstable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a>.

It is predicted that this consensus will soon crumble as people begin to take a critical position due to [[impact_of_political_actions_on_russian_society_and_economy | poverty and food shortages]], which are "stronger than billions of words propaganda" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>. Political upheaval is often sourced from the middle class, whose life plans and expectations have collapsed suddenly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>.

An "anti-Putin consensus" is rapidly forming, particularly among yesterday's beneficiaries of the regime â€“ the establishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:33:00">[18:33:00]</a>. These individuals, who accumulated vast wealth serving the country, now find their fortunes unusable and their international access blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:45:00">[18:45:00]</a>. This tension among the elite, combined with the despair and anger of the middle class, will lead to inevitable discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.

Bloomberg, a reputable business information agency, stated on March 6, 2022, that President Putin might lose power within the next 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:44:00">[20:44:00]</a>. This is significant because Bloomberg was among the first Western media outlets to report on the threat of a military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, having received its information from American intelligence sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:24:00">[21:24:00]</a>. This aligns with the speaker's own prediction, made months prior, that President Putin would disappear from politics in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:08:00">[22:08:00]</a>.

## Call to Action and Hope

While the current situation is dire, it is asserted that it will get "much worse" before it gets better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54:00">[22:54:00]</a>. Despite this, there is hope and a chance for the situation in Russia to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:41:00">[23:41:00]</a>. This opportunity, when it arises, is described as the "last chance" for the people and for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:01:00">[24:01:00]</a>.

The call to action encourages helping those who are worse off, those who keep the "spark of hope" alive, and those who defend common sense, human dignity, and moral responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:00">[24:22:00]</a>. Specific mention is made of supporting [[influence_of_propaganda_and_delegitimization_of_power | Alexei Navalny]], who single-handedly resists the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:53:00">[24:53:00]</a>.

The speaker expresses commitment to continuing to inform and support those who take a moral position, asserting that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:55:00">[25:55:00]</a>.

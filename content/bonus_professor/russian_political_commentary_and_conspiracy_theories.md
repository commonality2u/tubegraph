This article summarizes commentary and analysis from the sixth edition of a program addressing "hot questions" from viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The program, broadcast on Thursday, June 20, at 1 PM Moscow time, focuses on questions left under Monday videos, specifically those starting with a question in large letters or multiple question marks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Answers prioritize the most popular questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Key Conspiracy Theories and Allegations

### Putin's Status and Presidential Legitimacy
A central claim is that the current Russian President is a double and that the real Putin has been deceased since at least October 26 of last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This assertion is used to argue the illegitimacy of the recent Russian presidential elections, which were allegedly won by a double, making them "illegal by definition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The speaker states that even with falsification, the double did not achieve more than 50% of the votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The speaker notes that Ukrainian intelligence head Budanov previously discussed Putin's doubles but no longer raises the topic, implying a directive to remain silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

The speaker dismisses the idea that recent appointments of Putin's alleged relatives to government positions prove he is alive. Historically, the real Putin never appointed relatives to government roles, suggesting these new appointments are a "smokescreen" to create an illusion of his continued existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.

### Prigozhin's Whereabouts and Future
Contrary to reports by some "unpopular Arab media" that Yevgeny Prigozhin was spotted in Syria, the speaker states this is "not true" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Prigozhin is said to be in "another place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. The speaker anticipates Prigozhin's return to Russia to seek revenge on those he considers responsible for his "misadventures" and his enemies, including the "late Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. He is expected to receive support from those willing to cooperate with him, though these forces are not identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### Other Conspiratorial Elements
*   An incident on the night of June 6 in Tsarskoye Selo, where a pontoon with artists capsized near the Catherine Palace, resulting in an actress's death during an alleged secret visit by Putin, is denied by the speaker. He states he knows nothing about it, and if it were significant, he would likely be aware <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   The speaker dismisses a claim that Putin's cousin was appointed to the Ministry of Defense, again stating that the real Putin did not appoint relatives to government positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>.

## [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russian Internal Political Dynamics]] and Future Outlook

### Regime Stability and Elite Conflict
The current regime is described as having "exhausted itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The primary reason for this exhaustion is the belief among the regime's supporters that it has "outlived its usefulness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. A serious and "unstoppable" conflict within the elites is identified as the starting point of a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This conflict involves "political actions" and constant friction between different groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### Propaganda and Public Awareness
The speaker attributes the "zombified part of the Russian population" and their "sinister delusion" to state propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. To counter this, the state propaganda machine must be "switched off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Within six months of this action, a significant portion of society is expected to "come to its senses," though a minority will persist in their delusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The goal is a "change of climate in the country from malignant to benign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, facilitated by the inclusion of "other narratives" on television <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

Despite significant events like the [[russian_military_arrests_and_conspiracies | purges within the Ministry of Defense]], many people will remain unable or unwilling to see changes, clinging to the idea that "everything is as it was" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>. This is explained as a "common cognitive error" where people struggle to imagine a future different from the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.

### Governance and Justice
*   All individuals who committed "state crimes," regardless of their current or past positions, will face punishment according to the criminal code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   Regarding the pension reform, the speaker agrees that a main supporter, Andrei Makarov, should be punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   Once a new government comes to power, there will be a review of cases against officials like Golikova, who is described as a Category A official <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   Laws concerning the blocking of internet resources will be "virtually automatically" repealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>.
*   A "New Russian Republic" will be established, leading to gradual changes in all legislative acts and documents, including passports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.
*   Special departments or commissions, possibly within the Ministry of Internal Affairs, will be created to restore constitutional legality, dealing with civil, political, and property rehabilitation for those who fled Russia due to fabricated criminal cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>.
*   All personnel decisions made for individuals solely loyal to the Kremlin will be revised, with future appointments based on efficiency and other relevant factors, especially in culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>.

### Public Opinion and Values
There is a "huge request" in modern Russia for democratic and liberal values such as equality, a functioning court system, competition, freedom of movement, and competitive elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>. Most normal people desire the implementation of these values, even if they don't explicitly call them "democratic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

## Economic and Social Commentary

### Migration Policy and Demographics
The speaker discusses the "replacement of the Russian population with people from Central Asia and the Caucasus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This is attributed to the policy of the "late President Putin," who believed immigrants becoming citizens would be more reliable in voting and more dependent than the indigenous population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. To address this, a "well-thought-out, comprehensive, targeted policy" is needed, starting with the "introduction of a visa regime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

Concerns about "Islamization of Russia" are considered exaggerated, stating that with a "skillful migration policy," it is "not even close" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. The speaker also notes a shortage of mosques in some Russian cities/regions, but warns against them becoming a "stumbling block and a conflict field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### Financial and Economic Stability
*   The speaker believes that a restructuring of mortgages is inevitable due to what he calls "real robbery" in current rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   While a ban on the export of cash dollars and euros is not currently planned, security forces periodically discuss restrictions. Current limits exist (no more than $10,000 per person), but implementation is difficult, and the economic sector of the government opposes further restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   The speaker predicts that "food stamps" could be introduced in some regions under a "certain scenario" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.
*   The issue of freezing or blocking credit cards and deposits in case of mobilization was considered as a way to encourage people to go for mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>. However, this is not currently being considered due to categorical opposition from influential people in the Russian elite who deem it "destructive for the Russian economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
*   The speaker advises exchanging part of deposits for foreign currency (preferably clean dollars) within a week, as the dollar exchange rate is expected to stabilize and then grow again in the medium to long term due to an inevitable economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:13">[00:37:13]</a>. This crisis is expected to cover the end of this year and the beginning of next year, contributing to the deepening political crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:17">[00:38:17]</a>.

### Social Services and Infrastructure
*   Pensions will be "increased significantly" as Russia has the financial capacity within its budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>. However, the idea of equal pensions for everyone (e.g., president and cleaner) is deemed "categorically unfair" as pensions should reflect different labor contributions and qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:04">[00:24:04]</a>.
*   The availability of specialized European-produced medicines is uncertain, and interruptions are possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The speaker advises making reserves or finding alternative channels for obtaining vital drugs, as shortages are acute and expected to worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   The housing and communal services sector will be "thoroughly and radically reformed" to ensure transparency of financial resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. The question of state versus private ownership of housing companies is secondary to efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>.
*   The 2008 operation in Georgia is described as Saakashvili being "lured into a trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:40">[00:44:40]</a>.

## Geopolitical [[speculation_on_russias_future_political_and_military_actions | Speculation on Russia's Future Political and Military Actions]]

### War in Ukraine and Sanctions
The speaker states that the war in Ukraine does not continue because elites are interested in its continuation, but rather because they seek "peace on favorable terms" that would allow them to prolong and strengthen their own power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.
If Russia retains Donbass or other newly acquired territories without a broad compromise with Ukraine, a significant portion of sanctions will not be lifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>. While existence under sanctions is possible, the situation is worsening, and the risk of chaos is "very, very high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

### Hybrid Warfare and International Relations
The accumulation of migrants at the Belarusian border is not the beginning of a hybrid operation but rather a "test of the instruments of hybrid warfare" to "break the strength" of the West or European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.
Regarding foreign influence on European parties, the speaker notes that Marine Le Pen's party ("National Unification") received a loan from a Russian bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>.

### Regional Stability
If a crisis occurs, it is likely to be "particularly acute in the North Caucasus," leading to higher risks of secessionist movements. However, this does not automatically mean separation or that it would be beneficial for those regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. Chechnya, specifically, has a "protector" who has promised financial support if it embarks on an independent path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

## Personal Commentary and Outlook

### Speaker's Stance and Predictions
The speaker emphasizes that he does not comment on representatives of the Russian opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. He holds that people are endowed with free will, including "the right to make mistakes and even to be an idiot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. He refuses to react to slander or lies, guided by a principle that engaging with "howling cur[s]" distracts from one's goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
The speaker states that he is not bound by oaths, with the exception of the military oath, and intends to remain true to his word regarding the creation of a "fair and high-quality society in Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
He acknowledges that his "mysterious forces" are waiting for the "most opportune moment" to bring about change, emphasizing that the forces themselves bear responsibility for achieving their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.
If his team gains power, he predicts the crisis will be overcome within a year and a half to two years, with "noticeable improvements" visible almost immediately, leading to a trajectory of "sustainable and fairly rapid development" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

### Current Russian Population
The latest population census is considered "not very reliable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. According to the most reliable available data, the population of Russia (excluding migrants from Central Asia) is around 140 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.

The prospects for [[peace_negotiations_with_Ukraine | peace]] between Ukraine and Russia are complex, influenced by the perspectives of both the Russian elite and the Ukrainian leadership, as well as by ongoing [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | military and political dynamics]].

## Russian Elite's View
Within the Russian elite, there is an "absolutely predominant" desire to conclude [[kremlins_view_on_peace_with_ukraine | peace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. However, the terms of this [[potential_peace_proposals_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace]] remain a key question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. It is hoped that [[peace_negotiations_with_Ukraine | peace]] will be concluded not by the current government, seen as a continuation or even a "more severe modification" of Putin's government, but by a new Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

The current Russian military and political leadership believes that taking Avdiivka would increase the chance that the West would force Ukraine into [[potential_peace_negotiations_involving_russia_and_ukraine | peace talks]] with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. Additionally, the new Russian leadership, particularly Patrushev, is proposing to enter into [[peace_negotiations_with_Ukraine | peace talks]] via Lukashenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

## Ukrainian Leadership's Stance
Ukrainian intelligence is considered not very good at strategic political intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The Ukrainian leadership is described as being fearful, possibly because confirming the death of Putin could change the nature of [[potential_peace_negotiations_involving_russia_and_ukraine | peace negotiations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Ukraine officially stated that a major obstacle to [[peace_negotiations_with_Ukraine | peace]] was Putin's existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. With Putin's alleged death, this "log" could be removed, raising questions about what [[potential_peace_proposals_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace formula]] the Ukrainian leadership would then be willing to accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. However, the loud statements made by the Ukrainian leadership and Zelensky regarding a [[potential_peace_proposals_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace formula]] are considered not feasible, according to recent American press publications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## Public Opinion and Accountability
The speaker expresses pessimism about the Russian population's willingness to acknowledge the realities of the conflict and apologize to Ukrainians. They believe that many Russians will "close themselves off from recognizing an unacceptable reality" and try to ignore the "bloody confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Without significant efforts to explain "what was why it was done and what are the monstrously negative results" for both Ukraine and Russia, people may not understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Hopes that people will use common sense or learn from Soviet/Russian experience should be left for young people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

## Military Dynamics
Russia's current military strategy includes an offensive on Avdiivka, with the Russian military intending to capture it "at all costs" despite "colossal losses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>. The [[ukrainian_and_russian_military_pressures_and_potential_compromises | military-political leadership]] in Russia believes this offensive will create better conditions for [[potential_peace_negotiations_involving_russia_and_ukraine | peace talks]] by pressuring the West to force Ukraine to the table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>. This highlights the [[militarypolitical_situation_in_ukraine_and_russia | military-political situation]]'s impact on [[potential_peace_proposals_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace prospects]].

## Factors Influencing Peace
One perspective suggests that the question of [[potential_peace_negotiations_involving_russia_and_ukraine | peace negotiations]] would change if information about Putin's death were confirmed, as his existence was seen as a primary obstacle to [[peace_negotiations_with_Ukraine | peace]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. The speaker acknowledges that outlining specific contours of a future [[potential_peace_proposals_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace agreement]] in [[russianukrainian_relations_and_the_prospect_of_war | Russian-Ukrainian relations]] would be "extremely risky" to discuss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

This article explores the significance of recent events in the Bryansk region and their implications for [[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russian internal political dynamics]], particularly regarding [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian societal change and public dissatisfaction]], the position of Russian nationalists, and the prospect of a [[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_Russia | political crisis]] in Russia.

## The Bryansk Region Incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08"></a>

On March 6th, 2023, the 53rd episode of the "What's Happening" program discussed a significant event in the Bryansk region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08"></a>. After reviewing available information and consultations, it was asserted that the incident was a raid by a group identifying as the "Russian volunteer corps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27"></a>. The nature of this organization is largely unknown, with its existence only noted through this event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34"></a>.

The raid's primary purpose was symbolic and political, aiming "to show the flag" and "demonstrate its own existence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43"></a>, rather than being a military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25"></a>. The information surrounding the raid was highly contradictory and mutually exclusive, even for the President of the Russian Federation and high-ranking security officials, leading to the postponement of a Security Council meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38"></a>.

The symbolic message of the event was to demonstrate that the armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine could be transferred to Russian territory, carried out by Russian volunteers fighting for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57"></a>. However, it is considered unlikely that this event will garner widespread support from the [[russian_societal_change_and_public_dissatisfaction | Russian public]], especially given reports of killings and shelling of civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20"></a>.

### The Leadership's Response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28"></a>

The events in the Bryansk region highlighted the vulnerability of the population in border regions to sabotage groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14"></a>. Despite this, the leadership of the Russian Federation, including President Putin, does not appear to be concerned with protecting these territories, leaving their defense to governors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28"></a>. The primary concern for the Russian leadership, particularly President Putin, is their own security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42"></a>.

This focus on internal security is underscored by a mass drone attack on February 28th, which, although denied by Ukraine, demonstrated that Russian territory, including protected objects at significant depths, is "touchable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01"></a>. This perceived vulnerability is expected to play a significant role in future decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27"></a>.

### Purge of Russian Nationalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07"></a>

The incident in the Bryansk region is expected to serve as a pretext for a purge of Russian nationalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11"></a>. While formal nationalist organizations are non-existent in Russia, there is an underlying subculture and informal groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18"></a>. This purge is not driven by fears of nationalists joining Ukrainian forces but is instead linked to the anticipated [[russian_political_crisis_and_power_transition | political crisis]] that is expected to follow the end of the armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33"></a>. Security officers, who anticipate this crisis, are preemptively targeting groups like Russian nationalists, who could potentially become a "tip of the spear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47"></a>. Historically, Russian nationalists have been feared by the authorities, despite never having formed a serious political or paramilitary force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04"></a>.

## Elite and Public Moods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03"></a>

Great expectations were placed on the FSB Collegium meeting on February 28th, with anticipation of significant personnel changes within the FSB and other law enforcement agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02"></a>. However, no changes occurred, as the president chose not to "change horses during the crossing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38"></a>. The incident in the Bryansk region further reduced any chance of replacing the head of the FSB, Bortnikov, as such a move would imply presidential accountability, which is not being assigned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43"></a>.

Within the FSB, there is growing irritation towards President Putin, who they now characterize as "impotent" in political terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25"></a>. They believe he has made "tragic mistakes" that have led Russia into a "dead end," implying a need for a change in leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56"></a>.

## Emerging [[potential_economic_and_political_crisis_in_Russia | Economic Challenges and Political Crisis Developments in Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22"></a>

Despite reports from Bloomberg indicating that Russian imports and exports have returned to 2020 and pre-war levels, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58"></a>, other economic indicators suggest an impending [[economic_challenges_and_political_crisis_developments_in_Russia | economic crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22"></a>.

Retail sales in Russia have declined for ten consecutive months, falling by 10.5% in real terms by the end of last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39"></a>. This indicates that the population is becoming poorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54"></a>, and those who have money are saving it, anticipating worse times ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00"></a>. This consumer behavior suggests that an [[russian_economic_issues_and_potential_crises | economic crisis]] is "almost inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28"></a>.

Russia is reportedly spending between $300 million and $400 million per day on the "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50"></a>, a "gigantic" amount of money spent on killing people and destroying cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27"></a>. This spending is defined as being "against people," reflecting the meaning of Russia's foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49"></a>.

## Lukashenko's Balancing Act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19"></a>

Alexander Lukashenko, often seen as an ally of Russia, recently spent three days in Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30"></a>. During this visit, he sought guarantees from China for the preservation of Belarus's sovereignty, political support for his authoritarian regime, and financial assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49"></a>. Lukashenko publicly supported China's plan for a peaceful settlement of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, demonstrating loyalty to China, whom he now considers the "new master of Eurasia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09"></a>.

Contrary to some theories, Lukashenko did not convey messages from the Kremlin or Putin to Xi Jinping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26"></a>. His focus was solely on resolving Belarus's own problems, which caused discontent in the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36"></a>. Lukashenko is actively trying to balance the influence of the Kremlin and Putin to protect Belarus from formal absorption by Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55"></a>. He fears that if Russia loses the confrontation with Ukraine, Putin might try to "absorb" Belarus to compensate for the failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08"></a>. To counter this, Lukashenko is seeking support from Beijing, much like China provided crucial support to Kazakhstan in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28"></a>.

## Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55"></a>

The current year, 2023, is projected to be decisive in the ongoing, previously latent struggle, potentially moving into an open phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34"></a>. There is an expressed belief that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52"></a>.

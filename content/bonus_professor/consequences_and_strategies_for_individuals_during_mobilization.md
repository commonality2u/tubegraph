## Understanding Mobilization and Martial Law

Mobilization is defined as the transfer of a country's state structures, economy, and everyday life to a war footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. The decision to mobilize is inextricably linked with the introduction of martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Whether martial law precedes or follows mobilization is not fundamental, as the two are intertwined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

Key federal laws governing these processes include:
*   Federal Law 31: "On mobilization preparation and mobilization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   Federal Constitutional Law: "On Martial Law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   Law: "On military duty and military service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

Decisions on mobilization are made by the president, based on these federal laws, and potentially new legal acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

### Types of Mobilization

Mobilization can be:
*   **Partial mobilization**: Affecting specific territories of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
*   **Full mobilization**: A nationwide mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

Even if mobilization begins as [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | partial mobilization]], there is a high probability it will develop into a full national mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>.

### Grounds for Martial Law

The law on martial law lists reasons for its introduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. Relevant reasons include:
*   Bombing of Russian Federation territory by foreign armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   Attack by foreign armed forces on Russian Federation armed forces, regardless of location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   Exile of armed groups, gangs, regular forces, or mercenaries by a foreign state to carry out aggression against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
Formal legal grounds for the introduction of martial law and subsequent mobilization are already present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

## Who is Subject to Mobilization?

Citizens in the reserve who do not have a formal deferment are subject to conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

*   **Men**: All men with a military ID, aged 18 to 50, with fitness categories 'A' (fully fit) or 'B' (fit with minor restrictions) can be mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
    *   Those with 'V' (limited fit) health status who receive a military ID after 27 years old can also be mobilized from 27 to 50 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
    *   Reserved individuals are categorized: privates under 35 (first category), up to 45 (second category), and up to 50 (third category) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. Mobilization calls start with the first category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
*   **Women**: Women with necessary education and military registration specialties are subject to conscription, primarily medical fields but not exclusively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

### Who is NOT Subject to Mobilization (Current Law)

Under current law, certain individuals are not subject to conscription or may receive deferments:
*   Those who have not served and have not received a military ID up to 27 years old are not considered in the reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   Students of scientific educational institutions studying full-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
*   Individuals reserved for civilian needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.
*   Category 'G' (temporarily not fit for military service) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
*   Those caring for relatives or disabled people with confirmed illness or need for supervision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.
*   Guardians of minor brothers or sisters if no other guardians exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
*   Parents with up to 4 children (dependents up to 16 years old) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.
*   Single parents and pregnant women after 22 weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
*   Senators and State Duma deputies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
*   Certain categories of citizens can be granted a deferment by the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.
*   Individuals with an unexpunged conviction for a serious crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.
*   Those with Category 'D' from the draft board, meaning generally not fit for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.

New legal acts can be adopted, potentially altering these categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

## The Mobilization Process and Compliance

All citizens subject to conscription are obliged to appear at assembly points within the timeframes specified in mobilization orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. Orders can be delivered at home or work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. Summons may be presented by military registration and enlistment office employees, accompanied by police patrols or Russian Guard patrols, to ensure compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

When mobilization is announced, those registered for military service are prohibited from leaving their place of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. If they receive orders or a summons, they are obliged to appear at military commissariats or other relevant authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

Valid reasons for not appearing on summons, according to federal law, include:
*   Illness or loss of ability to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.
*   Serious health condition of listed relatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.
*   Death of relatives requiring participation in a funeral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

## Consequences of Non-Compliance

In peacetime, failing to appear on summons to the military registration and enlistment office results in administrative liability, such as a warning or a fine of 500 to 3000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>. Evasion of military service falls under Article 328 of the Criminal Code, which in peacetime can result in a fine of up to 200,000 rubles or imprisonment for up to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>.

Specific punishments in wartime are not detailed, but it's understood that martial law will likely be declared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that "it is better to lose a little money than a precious life" and health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.

## Strategies and Advice for Individuals

The speaker strongly advises individuals to think and prepare now, as it will be too late once mobilization is announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. This preparation is likened to the financial panic observed on February 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>.

### Financial and Practical Preparations

*   **Financial Preparation**: To mitigate the impact of potential account and card blocking for those subject to mobilization, individuals can transfer money to relatives' accounts or withdraw cash in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>.
*   **Travel Documents**: If you have a foreign passport, keep it in a safe place for quick access, as travel abroad may be prohibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

### Social and Geographical Considerations

*   **Geographical Impact**: Mobilization will first affect residents of small and medium-sized cities, and only last of all large cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. This means risks are higher in smaller areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.
*   **[[social_and_national_implications_of_mobilization | Social and National Implications]]**: The speaker suggests that those who publicly support the "special military operation," such as by displaying the letter 'Z' on their cars, should be the first to be mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. Similarly, senators and State Duma deputies, who adopt legislative acts related to mobilization, should demonstrate their commitment by serving in the front ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

### Broader [[Consequences and Impact of Mobilization | Consequences and Impact]]

*   **Economy**: Mobilization means the transfer of the entire country, including the already frail Russian economy and financial/banking system, to a military footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>.
*   **Private Business**: Confiscation of cars and other material/technical resources from private businesses may occur for purposes like transporting mobilized personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a>.
*   **Banking System**: There is a risk that the banking system will face significant disruption, potentially plunging into financial "hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The speaker emphasizes the urgency of making decisions now:
> "Because when time X comes, you will not have the opportunity to think, you will need to act, so please think now, decide with your family or yourself, and make a decision for yourself, develop some kind of algorithm of actions." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>

The speaker warns that Russia is becoming "a model of hell, social hell in the full sense of the word" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a>. Individuals are urged to guide themselves by the principle of continuous movement and prompt decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:32:00">[16:32:00]</a>.

Individuals are encouraged to take the information about mobilization as seriously as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>, take care of themselves, family, and friends, and help those trying to maintain common sense, moral fortitude, and human dignity within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a>.

The decision to mobilize is expected to be inextricably linked with the introduction of martial law, leading to significant financial consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. [[Mobilization strategies and preparations | Mobilization]] is defined as the transfer of the country's state structures, economy, and everyday life to a war footing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This transfer would encompass the "already frail Russian economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a> and the "not very strong Russian financial and banking system" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

## Impact on Personal Finances
Individuals subject to [[issues_related_to_military_mobilization_and_its_impact | mobilization]] may face financial restrictions.

### Bank Accounts and Cards
A decision has been made to block bank accounts and cards of those subject to [[issues_related_to_military_mobilization_and_its_impact | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. In anticipation of this, individuals are advised to transfer money to relatives' accounts or withdraw cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. However, it's noted that most people are not wealthy, making such preparations potentially impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

### Penalties for Non-Compliance
*   **Not appearing on summons (peacetime):** This incurs administrative liability, typically a warning or a fine ranging from 500 to 3,000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
*   **Evading [[military_service_and_mobilization_strategies | military service]] (peacetime):** This can result in a fine of up to 200,000 rubles or imprisonment for up to two years under Article 328 of the Criminal Code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

It is suggested that "it is better to lose a little money than a precious life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>, including precious health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

## Broader Economic Impact
When [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | mobilization]] is announced, it is anticipated to cause a rush to banks for money withdrawals and currency exchange, similar to events on February 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. The speaker warns that those who listen to advice about preparing financially will benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

The transfer of the entire country to a war footing will also impact private businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>. This could include the confiscation of cars and the need for material and technical resources for transporting mobilized individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The speaker states that he cannot predict what will happen to the banking system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, but notes that those who proposed blocking bank cards predicted that it would lead to a plunge into "financial hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

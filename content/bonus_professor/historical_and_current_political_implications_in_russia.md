This article discusses the significant [[change_in_the_political_landscape_in_Russia | political changes]] and implications arising from recent developments in the military conflict with Ukraine, particularly the proposed peace deal and its potential impact on Russian leadership and the nation's future.

## Strategic Turning Point in the Conflict

The withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson and the subsequent arrival of Ukrainian armed forces mark a strategic turning point in the armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine, consolidating it in favor of Ukraine [00:00:51]. This development has led to significant, almost "sensational," news regarding a peace proposal [00:01:16].

## Proposed Peace Deal: Terms and Implications

On November 10, the Kremlin reportedly received an offer of a peace deal with Ukraine [00:01:53]. This proposal, which has been agreed upon with the Ukrainian leadership, is described as a "proposal for the capitulation of the Russian Federation," impacting the country as a whole, not just the Kremlin [00:02:04].

The key demands and conditions of this proposal include:
*   **Withdrawal from Ukraine** The Russian armed forces must completely leave Ukraine, including the territories of the DPR and LPR, which Russia considers its subjects [00:02:31].
*   **Crimea's Status** The status of Crimea is to be suspended for seven years, during which it will not be discussed. The peninsula itself would be declared a demilitarized zone, allowing only police and border guards with small arms [00:02:46]. The Black Sea Fleet is required to leave Crimea [00:03:01].
*   **Demilitarized Border Zone** A demilitarized strip, 100 kilometers wide, would be introduced along the borders of Russia with Ukraine and Belarus, with no heavy weapons permitted in this zone [00:03:20].
*   **Transnistria** Russia must leave Transnistria, meaning the Russian military base, and Transnistria is to be included and integrated into Moldova in 2023, with Russia undertaking not to interfere [00:03:51].
*   **Ukraine and NATO** In return, Ukraine promises not to join NATO for seven years [00:04:05].

### Reaction of the Russian Establishment

The initial reaction to this ultimatum from the [[the_political_climate_in_Russia_and_government_policies | Russian establishment]] has been positive [00:04:14]. This is because the offer guarantees freedom and security to the establishment, including the security forces. They are guaranteed that criminal cases will not be brought against them or their family members, and they will not be persecuted [00:04:33]. The proposal also implies the preservation of at least a portion of their assets [00:05:08].

### President Putin's Decision and Potential Outcomes

President Putin's reaction to the proposal is currently unclear; he is "thinking" [00:05:12]. His decision is anticipated to be indicated by specific actions:
*   **Refusal:** If massive missile attacks on Ukrainian critical infrastructure, particularly power plants, are resumed, it would signify an unambiguous refusal of these conditions [00:05:28].
*   **Continued Reflection:** The absence of shelling does not necessarily mean acceptance, but rather that reflection continues and an attempt is being made to gain additional time to comprehend the situation, hoping for a "miracle" [00:05:44].

If Putin refuses the conditions that the Russian establishment is ready to accept, military action will continue, leading to a "highly probable" military defeat of the Russian Federation [00:06:15]. The only way for Putin to delay this inevitable outcome would be to employ a nuclear threat [00:06:44]. However, the chances increase that an order to use tactical nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction would be blocked or not carried out [00:07:07], which would de facto mean the end of his presidency as his orders would not be followed [00:07:13].

## Broader Political Implications for Russia

Regardless of the strategic decision President Putin makes, he will likely have to leave power [00:07:42].
*   **Acceptance of Ultimatum:** If Putin accepts the ultimatum, he would need to "go into the shadows" to save face and shift responsibility to another person to sign the "shameful agreement" [00:08:06]. This situation carries the risk of a palace coup [00:08:18].
*   **Continuation of Military Campaign:** If he continues the military campaign, hoping for a miracle, he will inevitably become a "scapegoat for its defeat" [00:08:28].

In any scenario, there will be a "sharp turn" in [[future_political_changes_and_developments_in_russia | Russian politics]], both internationally and internally [00:09:10]. This would signify a "complete, final fiasco" of 22 years of Putin's rule, policy, and system [00:09:23].

### Historical Analogy: The Crimean War

The closest historical analogy to the current situation is the defeat of Russia in the Crimean War (1853-1856) [00:09:37]. Emperor Nicholas, who took responsibility for that defeat, was initially confident in the Russian army's victory but, upon realizing the truth, essentially "killed himself" by refusing treatment and dying of inflammation [00:09:48]. This analogy suggests the profound impact the current situation could have on the Russian leadership.

## Outlook

The situation is developing rapidly, and Russia is living through a significant historical period [00:13:01]. Despite the challenges and fears, there is hope for a positive outcome and victory [00:13:25].

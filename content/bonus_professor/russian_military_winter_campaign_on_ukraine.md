The winter campaign, or "grand offensive," of the [[russian_military_tactics_in_ukraine | Russian armed forces]] on the Ukrainian fronts has reportedly "come to an inglorious end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. The only perceived "glory" during this period has been the "bloody storming of Bakhmut" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>, which Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the Wagner PMC, directly describes as "bloody" due to high losses and a lack of shells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Igor Strelkov Kirki also concluded that the winter campaign ended "without result," necessitating a wait for the enemy's next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>.

## An "Imitation" of an Offensive

Indirect signs suggest that the winter campaign was more an "imitation of a grand offensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. This imitation was intended to appease the supreme commander-in-chief, demonstrating that the forces were "not standing still" but "moving forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. However, progress was minimal, often "meter by meter, but not more than a meter in one day," and in most directions, even this small gain was not achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.

The purpose of this imitation was strategic: General Gerasimov, described as an "excellent planner," understands that a Ukrainian counteroffensive is likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. To prepare for this, it is crucial "not just to build a line of defense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. This defensive fortification, formerly known as the Surovikino line, is now expected to be called the Gerasimov line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. A significant portion of mobilized troops are dedicated to digging trenches and establishing this defensive line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. The expectation is that Ukrainian forces will "smash their heads on this line of defense" and retreat, potentially leading to negotiations when neither side can inflict a decisive defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

To hold this line, the remaining equipment and professional army must be preserved, and shell stockpiles must be accumulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. The "imitation of an offensive" was carried out to facilitate these preparations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

## Putin's Hopes for Chinese Support

As the [[ongoing_armed_confrontation_between_russia_and_ukraine | Russian side]] prepares for a Ukrainian counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>, President Vladimir Putin hopes for support from China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. Putin seeks a symbolic political win from a visit by the Chinese head of state, showcasing that he is not in international isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. He also hopes to receive "weapons ammunition from China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

However, China has not supplied military products to the Russian Federation despite discussions, causing "frustration and strong indignation" within the [[russian_political_and_military_strategies | Russian political leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. China provides "dual-use products" but not purely military ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

China's interest is for Russia to become "a sphere of interests sphere influence of the Great Eastern Neighbor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. This can only happen if Russia is "weakened enough during an armed confrontation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. From China's perspective, since Russia is already sufficiently weakened, it is time to "move to a peaceful trajectory" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. Supplying weapons would further antagonize China's relations with the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

Rumors suggest that China views Vladimir Putin as a "toxic asset for Russia" and believes the Russian leadership needs "personnel renewal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. For the first time under Putin, China has begun to doubt his ability to guarantee Russia's stability and China's interests in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.

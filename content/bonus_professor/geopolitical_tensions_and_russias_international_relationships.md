The Secretary of the Russian President, Peskov, made a statement on June 9th regarding a meeting between Yevgeny Prigozhin, commanders of the Wagner private military company, and President Putin in the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This meeting was reported to have lasted three hours and ended positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. However, this statement is described as "elementary brazen lies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. According to the speaker, no such meeting took place on June 29th or at any time thereafter, either collectively or individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The most that might have occurred, and even this is doubted by more substantial sources, was a telephone conversation between Putin and Prigozhin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Reasons for Disinformation and Manipulation

The dissemination of such false information by the [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_struggles | Russian leadership]] is attributed to several factors aimed at managing [[geopolitical strategies and positioning of russia | Russia's geopolitical strategies and positioning]] and internal perceptions:

*   **To Uphold Putin's Reputation**
    The primary reason is to portray Putin as a wise leader who is in complete control of the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This narrative aims to counter the negative impact on Putin's reputation, especially in the eyes of the elite and the "deep state," following the Wagner mutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The idea is to make the mutiny appear as a "cleverly conceived game" or "Putin's multi-move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **To Project an Image of Physical Capability**
    The lies also serve to demonstrate that Putin is physically capable and in good health, which the speaker states does not correspond to reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Public appearances, including a visit to Derbent, are described as "pure hoaxes," as Putin is physically unable to appear anywhere and is constantly replaced by a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. According to a phonoscopic and anthropological examination conducted in a G7 country, three different individuals appear under the general name of the President of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Response to International Humiliation**
    A significant reason for the deceptive statements is the humiliation Putin faces on the international stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

    *   **Turkey and Erdogan:** Turkish President Erdogan has taken actions perceived as humiliating to Russia, including transferring Azov fighters to Ukraine, supporting Ukraine's accession to NATO, and promising intensive military aid and the construction of Bayraktar drone factories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The Kremlin and Putin are forced to remain silent because [[oil_prices_and_russias_global_relations | Russia is critically dependent on parallel imports]] passing through Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
    *   **France and Macron:** The Kremlin has been actively trying to arrange a telephone conversation between Putin and French President Macron, who is reportedly refusing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. This represents a reversal of past dynamics where Macron would seek conversations with Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

## Implications of Geopolitical Challenges

The speaker asserts that the current situation points to a "dying nature" and that Putin is a person "not capable of making decisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. Trips to regions or abroad are undertaken by a double, indicating a risky undertaking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

The military attempt by Prigozhin and the armed rebellion have been viewed by Russian citizens as more significant than the ongoing "special operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

The official media's attempts to discredit Prigozhin by exposing his luxurious lifestyle have been ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Russian society is largely immune to such exposures, as any negative PR still attracts attention and "keeps you afloat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Moreover, the politically active part of society draws information from alternative sources like Telegram, not central television channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

The speaker concludes that Prigozhin has acted as an "icebreaker" that "split the ice surrounding Putin's regime," opening a "free space" for other individuals or groups to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. This situation represents a crisis that is already underway and presents a unique opportunity for citizens to participate in shaping [[potential changes in russias political landscape | Russia's future political landscape]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>.

> The speaker encourages engagement and staying informed through channels like Telegram for "operational information" on what needs to be done during this period of crisis and [[geopolitical consequences and crisis predictions in russia | political unrest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:45">[00:20:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>. Financial support is also framed as a form of civic activity contributing to the "liberation of our Motherland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

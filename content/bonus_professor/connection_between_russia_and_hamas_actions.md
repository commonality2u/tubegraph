Based on indirect data and some insider information, Russia was involved in the actions of Hamas against Israel, likely operating "under a foreign flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Aspects of Russian Involvement

Russian involvement is described in three aspects:
*   **Information and Planning Assistance** Russia provided assistance to Hamas in supplying sensitive information and planning the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. However, this assistance was likely not significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Training by [[role_of_wagner_pmc_in_assisting_hamas | Wagner PMC]]** Instructors from the [[role_of_wagner_pmc_in_assisting_hamas | Wagner PMC]] carried out combat and tactical training of Hamas fighters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The speaker specifically noted that these were Wagner instructors, not personnel from the Main Directorate of the former Russian General Staff or the Russian army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Weapon Supply** Hamas reportedly received weapons, specifically "half from the Russian Rona," potentially via the [[role_of_wagner_pmc_in_assisting_hamas | Wagner PMC]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This was possibly intended to suggest Ukrainian involvement in the attack through weapon leaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Motivations for Russian Involvement

Two primary reasons are given for Russia's involvement, both of which complement each other:
*   **Distraction and "Second Front"** The most apparent reason is to open a "Second Front" to divert the West's attention away from Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Revenge against Israel** A less obvious motivation is a desire for revenge by [[international_relations_and_the_involvement_of_russian_figures | Russian president]] Putin against Israel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This stems from Israeli doctors, who had been supervising his cancer treatment since 2020 and performed surgery in February, stating in March or April that they would no longer be involved in his treatment, leaving his fate "in the hands of God" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Broader Context

While Russia was involved, Hamas's operation was primarily conducted with the active participation and patronage of international terrorist networks, and apparently with the active participation of Iran <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Impact on the [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Russian-Ukrainian Conflict]]

The emergence of the war in the Middle East significantly impacts the [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Russian-Ukrainian armed confrontation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

*   **Shift in Media Attention** Ukraine has fallen out of the global media's focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. By October 6 or 7, American and other major global media outlets curtailed online coverage of military actions in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This shift in attention leads to a decrease in "energy" or support for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. It is currently difficult to imagine conditions under which Ukraine would return to the long-term focus of global media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Weapon and Ammunition Supply Prioritization** While financial resources are sufficient for both Israel and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, the supply of weapons and ammunition becomes a matter of choosing priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. It is implied that Israel will be the priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Decrease in Western Aid to Ukraine** The peak of Western aid to Ukraine was reached in the summer and early autumn of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. This aid is expected to decrease due to two main reasons:
    *   The emergence of a new theater of military operations in the Middle East <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
    *   The Ukrainian offensive's inability to achieve its strategic goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. While there have been positional successes, strategic objectives have not been met and are unlikely to be achieved this season <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Stalemate on the Front Lines** The most probable outcome of the summer-autumn campaigns is the transition of both sides to a mutual strategic defense, leading to a stalemate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This strategic dead end is now becoming complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. While a stalemate is unlikely to benefit Ukraine, the Russian leadership may be satisfied with this status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

## [[historical_and_current_political_implications_in_russia | Internal Russian Focus]]

The [[russian_elites_and_their_interaction_with_western_organizations | Russian military-political leadership]] is currently prioritizing the internal situation, specifically the resolution of the "Supreme Authority" issue, rather than presidential elections, which are seen as a formality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. It is claimed that the current president, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, is "living out the last days of his earthly life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. He is reportedly being successfully replaced by a double, referred to as "Vasilich" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. This double is reportedly making international visits, even to Beijing, where the Chinese side is aware of the situation and assessing the double as a junior partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### Power Struggle and Instability
The departure of the president, who was the system's core and moderator, will lead to an imbalance and rapid destruction of the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. The main influence among the president's inner circle is currently held by a coalition led by Nikolai Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. While Patrushev's victory is probable, it will not stabilize the highest [[russian_elites_and_their_interaction_with_western_organizations | Russian elites]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>. The future dynamics are considered "absolutely unpredictable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. A double is unlikely to replace the president for long, as consensus among the top 50 Russian elites is impossible to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Russia is entering a period of "highest turbulence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>, with many amazing, unexpected events, twists, and strange phenomena expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

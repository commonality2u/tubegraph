Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, in its 44th program recorded on December 18, 2022, discussed the increased "fear in the Kremlin" and the various security and risk concerns surrounding Russian President Vladimir Putin. These concerns reportedly influence his public appearances, strategic decisions, and the overall political landscape in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## Refusal of Public Events

During the week leading up to December 18, 2022, it was "quite intensively discussed" that the President of the Russian Federation refused all large-scale public events traditionally held at the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This included a New Year's reception and a large press conference, with his message to the Federal Assembly also remaining in question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

Three primary reasons were cited for these cancellations:

1.  **Inability to Address Questions**
    Putin reportedly had "nothing to say" in response to possible pressing questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Even with filtered questions during a press conference, there is a risk of unwanted questions appearing, and "any truthful question" is currently considered unwanted for the President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
2.  **[[Health and public appearances of Vladimir Putin | Health Concerns]]**
    The second reason is related to the [[health_and_public_appearances_of_president_putin | health of the president]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. He is reportedly "not able to withstand a long, hours of intense stress" from answering questions in a press conference or Direct Line format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Doctors do not recommend exposing him, described as "the only support of Russia" and "the embodiment of Russia," to such a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
3.  **Security and Caution**
    The third reason for cancellations is general caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Allegedly, Ukrainian armed forces aircraft are capable of penetrating "quite deeply into the territory of the Russian Federation," and the Russian defense system is reportedly "not able to identify, detain" or intercept them in the air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. The concern is that during an event like the message to the Federal Assembly, "unidentified aircraft" might appear over the Kremlin, which would cause significant panic among attendees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. Therefore, it is considered better not to risk Russia's "main asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## Putin's Personal Security Measures

Given these security concerns, alternative options are being discussed for public addresses, such as delivering the message to the Federal Assembly virtually from a "safe place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. The ceremonial New Year's reception was also canceled for security reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. According to "very reliable sources," Putin intended to celebrate the New Year "deep underground," far from Moscow, and generally "beyond the Urals," hoping that no unknown aircraft would reach him there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

## Broader Risks and Uncertainties

Western powers' calls for peace, exemplified by statements from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, US Secretary of State Blinken, and an article by Henry Kissinger, are partly driven by several risks associated with the ongoing conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. These include:

*   **Uncertainty of Military Actions**: The "fog of war" means victory is not guaranteed for any side, and the outcome is unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.
*   **Risk of Nuclear Escalation**: This risk is "unfortunately not zero" and is considered a serious concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.
*   **Economic and Demographic Pressure on Europe**: Russia's "energy war" is increasing human and demographic pressure on Europe, causing economic and financial losses that Europeans dislike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.
*   **[[Potential political crisis in Russia | Internal Instability from Defeat]]**: There is a "serious threat of crushing military defeat of the Russian Federation," which is not excluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>. Such a defeat, as has happened several times in Russian history, is capable of causing "very serious political" consequences with "unpredictable consequences and destabilization of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>. This potential destabilization poses "no less danger" to Europe and the global order than a crushing victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>.

These risks lead "at least some forces of the Western establishment" to avoid pushing things to extremes, based on the assessment that "the risks are much higher than the benefits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>.

Russian military operations in Ukraine involve an ongoing offensive in Donbass and public discussion of nuclear weapons use. The current situation is seen as a culmination of events that began with troop concentrations on the border.

## New Offensive in Donbass
The [[russian_military_situation_and_challenges_in_ukraine | Russian army]] has commenced a new offensive in Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This is considered a preliminary phase, with the full offensive expected to begin later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The preliminary stage of this offensive began during Holy Week for Orthodox Christians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Nuclear Weapons Rhetoric
Russian officials are publicly hinting at the possibility of using nuclear weapons against Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov stated that Russia is currently considering only conventional weapons in Ukraine, but the phrase "at this stage" suggests that other stages of the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | conflict]]'s development might involve different types of weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This rhetoric is acknowledged as blackmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Within President Putin's immediate circle, there is no one dissuading him from using tactical nuclear weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. His circle is reportedly confident that he will make this decision eventually, having resigned themselves to its perceived inevitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Context and Causes
The concentration of Russian troops on the Ukrainian border since the fall of the previous year, initially dismissed as blackmail, ultimately led to armed conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The speaker argues against underestimating the Russian president's readiness for decisive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

The public discussion about the possibility of using nuclear weapons and "massive use of force in Ukraine" is seen as strange and phantasmagoric, yet it has become "politically commonplace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Several reasons are given for this shift:
*   **Lack of War Experience** The modern world lacks politicians with personal experience of surviving war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **War as Acceptable Politics** War is now viewed as an acceptable method for conducting politics, particularly when economic or intelligence power is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Russia is cited as having "opened Pandora's box" in this regard, starting in 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Changed View on Nuclear Weapons** In Russia, the perception regarding the admissibility of using nuclear weapons has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. A strategic concept, "escalation through escalation," is adopted, where the threat of nuclear weapons is seen as a lever to bring a hypothetical enemy to terms and force retreat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **President Putin's Profile** The personal profile of President Putin is considered the most significant and decisive factor in the possibility of nuclear weapon use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. His actions do not inspire optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Degradation of the Russian State
The speaker also attributes the current situation to the "degradation of the Russian state" and society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Historically, the state's purpose, as defined by Aristotle, is to determine and maintain justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, or to prevent "hell on earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The speaker argues that the Russian state, over the past 20 years, has not fought for justice, citing examples such as beggarly pensions, increased retirement age, lack of justice in courts, and unfair income distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Instead, the state appears to exist only to create "hell on earth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>, abandoning its prerogative of defining justice and instead supporting injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

Saint Augustine's view that "in the absence of justice, the state turns into a gang of robbers" is cited to describe the Russian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Modern sociology, via Mancur Olson, defines the state as a "stationary bandit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

The absence of justice blurs the opposition of good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The Russian state is accused of promoting "militant immorality" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, renaming war as a "special military operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, and forcing individuals to make immoral choices through threats of punishment or economic loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This constant choice in favor of ignoring good, driven by fear and a search for easier paths, has led Russia to a "catastrophe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

## Path Forward
The speaker emphasizes that the most important task for Russia's future, if it survives, will not be economic restoration or political reform, but the "restoration of the foundations" and a return to distinguishing between good and evil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. This involves understanding that justice exists and is innate, and that the state's purpose is to strive for justice, if not perfectly, then at least to eliminate blatant injustice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Without a return to these basic moral foundations, the future is deemed "hopelessly useless" and "doomed to repeat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

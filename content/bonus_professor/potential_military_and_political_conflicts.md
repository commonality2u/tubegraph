The current geopolitical landscape suggests a significant increase in [[potential_political_and_military_developments_in_russia | military]] and political pressures within Russia and its immediate vicinity, with plans for expanded mobilization, stricter enforcement of martial law, and potential shifts in the conflict's intensity and scope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Expanded Mobilization and Martial Law

Following the New Year holidays, Russia reportedly plans to implement a broader mobilization alongside the introduction of martial law across a significant portion of its territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This new phase of mobilization is expected to be more organized and tougher than previous efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Scope and Target

*   **Numbers:** Intentions suggest mobilizing up to 2 million people, which includes 300,000 women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
*   **Nature:** It will be declared as a "general mobilization," rather than a "partial" one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Purpose:** The stated goal is to ensure an advantage on the fronts, or at least withstand the Ukrainian offensive and cement Russian defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Recruitment Methods:**
    *   Summonses are reportedly ready in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
    *   Photos of those subject to mobilization are being entered into the facial recognition system, particularly effective in the Moscow Metro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Individuals may be approached directly in the metro and offered to go to a mobilization point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Targeted Groups:**
    *   Students: Final-year students may be at risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
    *   Women: Primarily doctors and medical personnel, with other women possessing military registration specialties also potentially included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### Implications of Martial Law

Martial law, already implemented in "new territories" of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, is expected to extend to major cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This grants authorities significant powers:

*   **Labor Mobilization:** Citizens aged 14 to 60 or 65 can be subjected to labor mobilization to strengthen the country's defense capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Property Rights:**
    *   **Organizations:** Forced change of ownership or nationalization of companies is possible, with part of large corporate and private property being transferred to "right patriotic hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    *   **Private Property:** Seizure of private property with subsequent compensation is enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   **Freedom of Communication:** Martial law provides for the possibility of restricting freedom of communication and the use of information, potentially leading to attempts to block platforms like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Exit Restrictions:** A database of up to 7 million people potentially subject to mobilization will be transferred to the border service, preventing them from leaving the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Complete bans on leaving Russia are not anticipated, but partial bans for those in the database are likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## [[Military and nuclear concerns regarding Ukraine and Russia | Military and Nuclear Concerns]]

The ongoing conflict raises concerns about both conventional and nuclear [[comparison_of_military_powers | military powers]].

### Ukrainian Countermeasures

To counter the Kremlin's objectives, Ukraine is advised to:
*   **Leverage Western Aid:** Use the energy sector's destruction to pressure Western countries for more modern and long-range weapons, including ammunition and missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Offensive Operations:** Carry out successful offensives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Retaliatory Strikes:** If sufficient long-range weaponry is received, strike at Russian infrastructure beyond border regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Nuclear Threat and Response

The probability of the Kremlin using nuclear weapons, including tactical ones, is acknowledged as non-zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. The decision to use nuclear weapons may arise if the situation on the fronts becomes "completely lousy" for Russian forces or if the general mobilization fails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

*   **NATO Response:** The West has promised a retaliatory strike with conventional weapons in response to Russian tactical nuclear weapon use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This plan has been under consideration since before 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   **Escalation Risk:** Such a conventional strike, for example, on the Black Sea Fleet, could compel Russia to respond with massive use of tactical nuclear weapons, potentially leading to further escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
*   **Western Readiness:** While Europeans may be hesitant due to the direct impact on Europe, Americans and Britons are reportedly ready for such escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## Internal Political and Economic Outlook

Russia faces a period of high uncertainty, with internal political shifts and economic challenges looming.

### Political Instability

*   **Protest Potential:** The protest potential of Russian society is considered "quite high," evidenced by phenomena like arson of military registration and enlistment offices, though these have reportedly ceased due to increased security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>. Official polls indicate growing readiness for protest among Russian women and a lower real rating for Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>.
*   **Leadership Transition:** The current situation is compatible with forecasts of a transition of power, as the president wishes to "close" the special military operation in his favor before handing over authority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. The health of the president is a key variable that could lead to sudden collapse of plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   **Revolutionary Potential:** A revolution in Russia is not ruled out, though its prediction remains impossible, in line with political analysis axioms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a>.
*   **Future Challenges:** Disorganization and chaos, reminiscent of or exceeding the 1990s, are anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. This will be contextual, affecting some areas more than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>.

### Economic Impact

*   **Rubel Stability:** The ruble, currently stable, is expected to become "catastrophically unstable" during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>.
*   **Confiscation of Deposits:** Currency deposits are already frozen and forcibly converted to rubles, making it doubtful whether they will ever be retrievable in their original currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. Ruble deposits are not threatened as the Central Bank can print more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.
*   **Asset Depreciation:** Many assets, including apartments and cars, are getting cheaper. The decision to sell depends on individual strategy and plans to leave Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.
*   **Poverty and Budget:** Russia is expected to face mass poverty and a meager budget, making it difficult to compensate people for unpaid pension payments or reverse pension age increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Government Procurement:** Financing for government procurement, repairs, and reconstruction in the social sphere will be reduced, while defense industry funding will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:04">[00:31:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:13">[00:31:13]</a>.
*   **Food Security:** While immediate food shortages are not expected, some regions are preparing for food rationing or food cards to ensure access for socially vulnerable groups, rather than due to scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>.

## Regional Geopolitical Outlook

Neighboring countries also face [[geopolitical_implications | geopolitical implications]] from Russia's actions.

### Kazakhstan

No prerequisites for war are currently seen in Kazakhstan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. Its future critically depends on the ruling group's ability to implement announced reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

## Future Outlook

The coming year is anticipated to be harder than 2022, requiring resilience from citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:38">[00:30:38]</a>. Despite the challenges, there is a chance for a future without war, sanctions, and lawlessness, depending on both external circumstances and collective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.

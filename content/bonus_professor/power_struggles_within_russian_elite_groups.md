The current [[russian_political_system_and_leadership | Russian political system]] is characterized by an ongoing [[internal_political_dynamics_and_power_transition_in_Russia | internal political dynamics and power transition]], manifesting as a complex [[struggle_among_russian_elite_coalitions | struggle among Russian elite coalitions]]. This [[russian_political_dynamics_and_power_consolidation | Russian political dynamics and power consolidation]] is expected to result in a political crisis with an unpredictable course and outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>.

## Nature of the Political Crisis
While the beginning of a political crisis is predictable with over 75% accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>, its exact course and final results are not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. Active participation from the outset can, however, influence the desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. The most acute phase, or "peak," of the crisis is anticipated to last only a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>, but the crisis itself will extend for several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

Despite the intensity of the [[struggle_among_russian_elite_coalitions | elite struggle]], a full-scale civil war covering a significant part of the Russian Federation's territory is not expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. While armed excesses are probable and may be localized in the capital, they are likely to be brief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. The crisis will be most acute in the North Caucasus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. There will also be no collapse of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

## Key Elite Factions and Their Influence
The political landscape is shaped by powerful, equally influential coalitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Nikolai Patrushev
Nikolai Patrushev and his allies face opposition from equally influential figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Patrushev's refusal to compromise with other members of the "Politburo" is noted, though the speaker suggests that the pursuit of power in Russia can "blind the eyes" and distort rational sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. There is a strong possibility that Patrushev will not accept the outcome if his son is not appointed to a specific position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. Patrushev, like Chemezov, prefers to govern or influence Russia from "behind the scenes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:48:00">[39:48:00]</a>.

### Sergey Chemezov
Sergey Chemezov's coalition is considered to be potentially stronger than Patrushev's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. The overwhelming majority of business people gravitate towards Chemezov's coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. Chemezov theoretically could become president, but reportedly has no desire to do so, preferring to influence from behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:36:00">[39:36:00]</a>.

### Other Figures
*   **Andrey Kostin (VTB team member):** He is not a supporter of Patrushev and gravitates towards Chemezov's coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   **Dmitry Peskov:** He is not part of any team, his influence is insignificant, and he does not influence anything despite speaking on behalf of the authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>. Peskov, like the entire top [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Russian political elite]], is aware of Putin's alleged death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:51:00">[32:51:00]</a>.
*   **Yevgeny Prigozhin:** It is anticipated that Prigozhin will reappear in the Russian Federation at a time he deems most favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:12:00">[37:12:00]</a>.

## Role of State Security Organs
During the upcoming political crisis, various state agencies are expected to take specific roles:

*   **Prosecutor General's Office and Investigative Committee:** These bodies will likely align with the winning side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. In the acute phase, they may not play a direct role as they lack armed resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>, but they can serve as important instruments in the hands of one of the coalitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA):** The MIA is expected to subordinate itself to the winning side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Its most preferable position is neutrality, following a "fortress plan" where it closes itself off and does not intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>. This behavior is compared to the KGB of the USSR in August 1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
*   **Ministry of Defense and General Staff:** The Ministry of Defense will likely remain neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. Within the General Staff, the main department might play an important role when the critical moment arrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

## Resistance to the Narrative of Putin's Death
The speaker calmly and confidently asserts that Putin is not alive, stating 146% confidence in this fact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>. Other bloggers and opposition figures do not "furiously claim" this for several reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:01:00">[31:01:00]</a>:
*   They may lack similar confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:18:00">[31:18:00]</a>.
*   They may be afraid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:24:00">[31:24:00]</a>.
*   Reporting Putin's death would "destroy their coordinate system," as they have based their fight against [[russian_political_elite_and_putin | Putin]] for years, even decades, on his existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:28:00">[31:28:00]</a>. This would necessitate a complete change in their ideological equipment and strategy, which is "very difficult" and "extremely offensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:51:00">[31:51:00]</a>, representing an "intellectual fiasco" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:09:00">[32:09:00]</a>.

## Confidence in Power Transition
The speaker's confidence in their team coming to power is based on:
1.  **Rational understanding:** Knowledge of the specific situation in society and an understanding of the balance of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:52:00">[37:52:00]</a>.
2.  **Other factors:** Additional, undisclosed elements contribute to the confidence that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:04:00">[38:04:00]</a>.

The possibility of restoring a monarchy in Russia is raised, with the speaker personally believing it "might make sense" in the "very distant future" (15-20 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:03:00">[39:03:00]</a>. This would involve a new dynasty and a "limited" monarchy, with the monarch serving primarily as a symbol of unity and a guardian of law and order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:00">[39:13:00]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes the importance of a person realizing they can "do something with his own hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This philosophy is rooted in personal experience and practical skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## Carpenter Qualification

The speaker proudly states that he worked in a construction team and was awarded the qualification of a fourth-category carpenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. He remains proud of this achievement, even though he did not become a fifth or sixth-category carpenter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

This fourth-category qualification was obtained in a student detachment during his time in the USSR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The category was necessary to receive payment for their work, which at the time amounted to a "decent" sum of around 1,000 rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Acquired Skills and Work Performed
As a fourth-category carpenter, he specifically knows how to build windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The formal category was earned by performing a "certain amount of work," which included major repairs of small houses and demolishing roofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

### Anecdote with a US President
The speaker recalls a conversation with a former U.S. President about his carpenter qualification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. When the President expressed disbelief, asking, "it can't be do you have proof?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, the speaker was prepared and provided proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The President's reaction upon seeing the proof was, "Well, I'll kick their ass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>, implying he would take action against those who doubted the speaker's manual labor experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. The speaker then suggested they work together as Russia, USA, and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This anecdote also relates to [[public_speeches_and_expressions | public speeches and expressions]] and potentially [[international_relations_and_cooperation | international relations and cooperation]].

## Student Detachment Context
While the speaker obtained his carpentry qualification through a student detachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, other members of these detachments were involved in significant projects such as the construction of the Vostochny Cosmodrome and Olympic facilities in Sochi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

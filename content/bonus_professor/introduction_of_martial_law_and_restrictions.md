Valery Solovyov's program, recorded on November 18, discusses the likelihood and implications of expanded [[martial law and its implications | martial law]] and a second wave of mobilization in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Expected Escalation of Military Action

Following Russian President Vladimir Putin's abandonment of peace negotiations with Ukraine, an escalation of military action is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This escalation is expected to manifest in several ways:
*   A second stage of mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   The [[russian_general_mobilization_and_martial_law | introduction of martial law]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   The imposition of [[potential_restrictions_under_martial_law | restrictions on civil liberties and rights for Russian citizens]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

There is a very high probability that these measures will be announced after the New Year holidays, likely in mid-January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Some radical viewpoints suggest a simultaneous announcement with the draft in December, but January is considered more probable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. These actions are framed within the concept of a "people's war" proposed by Kiriyenko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Expansion of Martial Law's Scope

Currently, [[martial law and its implications | martial law]] applies only to the "new territories" within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. However, it is expected to be expanded to other territories, including the capital and large cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The exact timing for this expansion remains open and will depend on the evolving situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## [[potential_restrictions_under_martial_law | Potential Restrictions Under Martial Law]]

[[martial law and its implications | Martial law]] implies a range of [[restrictions_and_measures_taken_by_the_government | restrictions and measures]]:

### Movement and Travel
*   [[closure_of_borders_and_restrictions_on_movement | Restrictions on travel outside the Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   It is highly probable that the right to travel abroad will be limited for those included in the mobilized base, which is estimated to be about seven million people, including women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   Possible restrictions on movement between regions within the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Civil Liberties
*   Any person can be detained or interned without charges for 30 days under [[martial law and its implications | martial law]] norms, with the possibility of extension for an apparently unlimited period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   Military-civilian authorities will gain the right to requisition necessary premises, means of transport, and similar items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. While theoretically applicable to Moscow, this is not expected to be widely enforced there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   Authorities can impose curfews and restrictions on the operation of cultural, educational, and entertainment establishments, similar to measures during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

These [[restrictions_and_measures_taken_by_the_government | measures]] are largely anticipated to take effect after the New Year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Advice for Citizens Amidst [[impact_of_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | Mobilization and Martial Law]]

Individuals, especially men of draft age, are advised to formulate a survival strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>.
*   Those with resources should consider leaving Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
*   If leaving Russia is not possible, consider moving internally to a less affected area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   The speaker stresses the importance of deciding whether one values their life and the lives of loved ones over enduring inconvenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   For those staying, it is recommended to legally acquire weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>.
*   Establishing forms of interaction and cooperation with neighbors is also advised, as it will be needed in the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>.

For minors and school students, it is strongly recommended to enroll in educational institutions that offer state accreditation and, consequently, a deferment from conscription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. If this is not an option, individuals should seek a place to "sit out a few very difficult months" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:15">[00:24:15]</a>. If able to go abroad, doing so now is crucial, as departure may become impossible once the second stage of mobilization begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. Young families are also advised to consider these existential choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

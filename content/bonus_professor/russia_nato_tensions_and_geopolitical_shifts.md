The past week saw significant geopolitical developments, primarily centered around the G7 and NATO summits. These events have underscored a new phase in international relations, characterized by heightened tensions between Russia and the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## NATO Summit Outcomes

The NATO summit yielded critical decisions that redefine the military alliance's stance towards [[military_and_geopolitical_issues_involving_russia_and_its_neighbors | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>:
*   **Designation of Russia as an Enemy**: Russia has been officially designated as an enemy of the military alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   **Rapid Deployment Forces**: A decision was made to deploy 300,000 rapid deployment forces to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Aid to Ukraine**: Unlimited aid and support were promised to [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **NATO Expansion**: Sweden and Finland have been included in NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This expansion has nearly doubled the length of the border of contact between NATO and the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## A New Cold War Era

The current geopolitical landscape is akin to a new Cold War, though with key differences from the previous one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The Cold War was characterized by confrontation conducted according to certain rules, including the Soviet Union's avoidance of direct clashes in the European theater of military operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Conflicts typically occurred through proxy wars in regions like Latin America and Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Currently, [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Ukraine]] has become a direct field of conflict, not only between [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Russia]] and [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Ukraine]] but also between [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Russia]] and NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This situation is described as [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Ukraine]] finding itself "inside European Africa or Latin America," a bitter reality with severe consequences for Ukrainians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Kaliningrad Transit Issue

Efforts are being made to prevent the opening of a second front in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Brussels is reportedly pressuring Lithuania to resolve the transit problem through the Kaliningrad region in favor of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Despite public solidarity from Great Britain and the United States with Lithuania's position, it is likely that Brussels will achieve transit conditions favorable to [[military_and_geopolitical_issues_involving_russia_and_its_neighbors | Russia]] to avoid further escalation on the European continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Russia's Special Military Operation and Shifting Goals

The "special military operation" has seen slow progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. On July 3rd, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported that [[military_and_geopolitical_issues_involving_russia_and_its_neighbors | Russian]] armed forces had taken full control of the Luhansk region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This result, after four and a half months of fierce confrontation, is described as a tactical success but not a strategic coup or a breakthrough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

The slow advance has led to a reduction in the public political claims of the Kremlin and Putin personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Initially, the goals were defined as "denazification" and "demilitarization" of [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. However, during a visit to Central Asia, Putin stated the goal was to "liberate Donbass and guarantee the security of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Russia's Strategic Trap and Economic Mobilization

The Kremlin is seen as being drawn into a strategic trap, increasing its efforts to overcome the resistance of [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Ukraine]] and the world community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This continuous increase in effort depletes Russia's material, human (anthropological), and moral-psychological resources, leading to social, technological, and economic degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

### Economic Measures
The [[internal_russian_political_dynamics_and_changes | Russian]] government is moving towards a mobilization model of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Proposed amendments to federal law grant authorities the right to introduce "special measures" in the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>:
*   **Mandatory Government Orders**: Firms and enterprises, regardless of ownership, will be prohibited from refusing government orders and contracts related to [[military_and_geopolitical_issues_involving_russia_and_its_neighbors | Russian]] armed actions outside [[russia_ukraine_relations_and_conflict | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This resembles the Soviet era, where the economy was heavily linked to the military-industrial complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Interference in Labor Relations**: Authorities can change contract terms during implementation and interfere with labor relations within organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Employees can be compelled to work at night, on weekends, and holidays, and vacations may be canceled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Investor Status**: Gazprom's refusal to pay dividends, the first time since 1998, signifies that private investors are viewed as "freeloaders" with no true ownership rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. This reflects a regime entering a state of mobilization economy, accompanied by restrictions, harshness, simplification, and pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

### Internal Political Dynamics
The Kremlin's primary concern has shifted from liberal critics to "turbo patriots" or "hurray patriots" who criticize the Kremlin for insufficient harshness or concessions in the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. The FSB has been instructed to "thin out the ranks" of these right-wing critics, indicating that only the Kremlin has the right to define what is fair or needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Citizens are expected to remain silent and enthusiastically approve all government actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

## Putin's Foreign Engagements

Putin recently visited Tajikistan and Turkmenistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. In Turkmenistan, the focus was on gas and affirming the Caspian Sea's status as an inland sea for bordering countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. The trip to Tajikistan aimed to improve relations and discuss containing the Taliban, despite the Taliban being recognized as an extremist organization in [[internal_russian_political_dynamics_and_changes | Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Putin's reluctance for physical contacts during his visit was attributed to a fear of assassination, characteristic of dictators with age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

There are also indications that Putin's trip to the G20 summit in Indonesia might not happen, suggesting he is "not wanted" there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

## Internal Repressions

In line with the mobilization regime, the government is cracking down on cultural complexities and dissent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.
*   **Vladimir Mau**: Vladimir Mau, a highly influential rector and head of the Academy of National Economy and Public Administration, was placed under house arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. His loyalty, including signing a letter in support of the "special military operation," was deemed worthless by the authorities, sending a signal to other "systemic liberals" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
*   **Gogol Center**: The Gogol Center, a "highly useful and fascinating place," was closed and reverted to being the Gogol Theater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. This closure reflects the government's move towards simplification and away from any cultural complexities, regardless of whether they are overtly oppositional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>.

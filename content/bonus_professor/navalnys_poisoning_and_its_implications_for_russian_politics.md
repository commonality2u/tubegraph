The poisoning of [[Alexei Navalnys imprisonment and its implications | Alexei Navalny]] was an unexpected event that significantly impacted the [[Russian internal political dynamics | Russian domestic political situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Russia agreed to transfer him to German doctors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>, with President Putin personally deciding that Navalny should be treated in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

## The Incident and Interested Parties

The assassination attempt on Navalny resulted in him "seriously suffering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. The speaker suggests that the same "interested party" was behind this incident as well as an alleged wiretap attempt on Ukrainian journalist Mikhail Tkach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. This party, though not located in Ukraine, reportedly acted through Ukrainian security services in the Tkach case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. The speaker, living in the Russian Federation, states they are limited in revealing the identity of this party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

German doctors attempted to bring Navalny out of a coma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>. The Russian leadership is highly concerned about his health and has issued a direct order to obtain information on his condition as a priority, even before it is publicly released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:49">[00:19:49]</a>. Information regarding his health, such as attempts to take him out of a coma, was reported to the Russian president within 10-12 hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>.

## Implications for Russian Politics

The primary motivation behind the attempt on Navalny's life appears to be the Kremlin's profound fear of [[russian_domestic_political_situation | political unrest]] and mass protests expected in the fall or early next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. The action aims to deter or neutralize potential leaders who could head these protests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. The speaker also reveals that they were personally warned of a poisoning attempt, and similar methods are being considered for other figures on the Kremlin's "liquidation list" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.

### Kremlin's Stance and Future Response

The Kremlin is reportedly unconcerned about the international reaction to the poisoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. Should pressure increase or evidence of Russian involvement emerge, Russia will deny everything, but cynically propose a joint investigation, akin to their approach to the Malaysian Boeing incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.

Navalny's political future hinges on his recovery and whether he will fully regain his health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

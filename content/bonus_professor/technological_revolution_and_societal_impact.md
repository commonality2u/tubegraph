From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The world is currently experiencing a significant transition, characterized by fundamental shifts that began in the 1990s, largely connected with the collapse of the Soviet model of socialism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This ongoing transition is proceeding "without much blood, without an earthquake," though the pandemic highlighted rather than initiated this feeling of change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It is a cluster of changes, where technological revolutions overlap with geopolitical shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The exact nature of the new world emerging is unknown, but human will and desire can still influence its formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## [[Philosophical and historical reflections on societal trends | Societal Transformation and Loss of Complexity]]

The current transition moves away from a "clearly ordered world" observed in the mid-1980s, which itself had begun to simplify from a peak of complexity and flourishing in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. There is a sense of living on the ruins of a former world, where the meaning of cultural artifacts, libraries, and even gods is forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This situation is akin to the "new Middle Ages" or Stephen King's "Dark Tower," where people use technologies (telephone, gun, car) without understanding their function or origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Impact of Technology on Human Nature and Education

The technological revolution, despite its colossal nature, is observed to lead to a simplification and unification of human nature, alongside a decrease in intelligence levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. While the percentage of intelligent people in each generation remains constant, the vast cultural heritage of European and world civilization is disappearing, with interests shifting away from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

> "The whole gigantic culture that was developed there by European and in general world civilization at the end of the twentieth century it disappears interest has shifted." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>

Universities, once instruments of anti-segregation by offering access to education, are now becoming instruments of segregation, as only elite institutions foster the critical skills necessary for understanding complex texts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. The ability to read large texts is becoming a "psychologically unsolvable task" for many young people, and attention spans are significantly diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This decline in cognitive abilities creates a divide between those who can strategize and plan, and those with "a memory well like a goldfish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Freedom and Control in the Future

The world of the future is predicted to have numerous restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. However, many people will not perceive these limitations because they lack the initial education or the will to acquire knowledge, which is seen as "overcoming oneself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Individuals raised in a world permeated by gamification may live in a "huge illusion," a "simulacra," lacking the desire or will to break through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

This vision evokes Aldous Huxley's *Brave New World*, which, rather than being about socialism, describes a world where people are so merged with the system that their individual existence disappears or even becomes criminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The concept of "will" (Schopenhauer's "world as will and representation") remains fundamental, as the act of cultural creativity or cognition stems from an act of will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Elites and Power Structures

The "gentlemen" of the future world are largely the world's financial elite, a dominant but hermetic group not inclined to expansion, preferring to maintain their status quo through closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This trend is particularly noticeable in Anglo-Saxon and European societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

Beneath the visible surface, there are "non-public organizations" â€“ influential order-type groups, numbering about a dozen and a half, distinct from the less influential Masons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. These organizations include the "cream of Western society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Their goals extend beyond wealth or even knowledge, focusing on the "transformation of human nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

### Russian Elite's Aspirations and Exclusion

The Russian elite is generally not accepted into these influential circles, causing significant irritation to those who believe they have "grabbed God by the beard" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This exclusion is due to several factors:
*   **Lack of defined status:** Their past identities (communists, then "pure Denikins and Kolchaks") make their current status unclear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
*   **Lack of perceived mission:** They do not possess a characteristic sense of historical responsibility for a nation or a mission, unlike their Western counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
*   **Reputation for theft:** Western elites view many Russian counterparts as "thieves," making dialogue impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This judgment is based on their acquisition of wealth, regardless of ethnicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.
*   **Deep distrust:** Security officers from Russia, who consider themselves "a shield and the sword of the party," are deeply despised by these Western organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. This distrust hinders professional activities, unlike previous eras when "gentlemen" could negotiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:22">[00:17:22]</a>.

The majority of the Russian elite is driven by "money and power," and while some aspire to leave a "good memory" in history, they are unwilling to conflict with the authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. An FSB department, created in 2012 after the Bolotnaya Square protests, monitors the top 100-150 Russian individuals to prevent any political investment or support against the presidential administration's will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

### Internal Power Struggles and Occultism in Russia

A fierce struggle for power succession, a "fight of bulldogs under the carpet," is ongoing among key figures like Kovalchuk, Timchenko, Igor Ivanovich, Patrushev, Dmitry Medvedev, and Sergey Shoygu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:29">[00:22:29]</a>. Moscow Mayor Sobyanin, initially written off during the pandemic for exceeding his authority, has found new allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:05">[00:23:05]</a>.

In addition to typical political intrigues, Russian elites are resorting to occult means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. This includes turning to Siberian or Latin American shamans and even practicing animal sacrifice, such as the ritualistic extraction of a black goat's heart, which has gained popularity in "narrow circles" in Moscow since 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. This trend, a shift from "red threads of Kabbalah," indicates an increasing demand for such practices as they feel the ground shifting beneath their feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. They also view Orthodoxy as a form of magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. However, they struggle to find genuine masters of these practices who could provide "initiation" or "open" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Occultism in Russian Politics
> Individuals with "colossal resources" who consult these practitioners are primarily interested in increasing their fortune and strengthening their power, or, since 2020, how to save their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>. They show no interest in seeking truth or understanding the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.

The current Russian authorities, facing self-doubt and insecurity about their legitimacy, often resort to brutal repression and tone to instill confidence in themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>. They are very afraid of change, of the situation getting out of control, and of the West, whose values and organizations they cannot "cut off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. This fear is a consequence of their deep insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>.

### Asset Protection and Influence

To protect their assets, Russian elites have been converting digital holdings into physical forms, storing "tons and tons of dollars" and "tens of tons of gold" abroad in "real storage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>. This shift to physical assets, inaccessible to Western intelligence, has led them to store wealth in places like Africa and Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>. Figures like Prigozhin, while subject to sanctions, are seen as mere instruments of the supreme power, tasked with creating "bases" for these assets in Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:24">[00:56:24]</a>.

## [[Social and intellectual dynamics in modern Russian society | Societal Dynamics and Future Outlook]]

The system in Russia lacks a "meaning of development," characterized by mutually competing groups and an objectively aging supreme power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. The only way to move forward, given the lack of meaningful historical narratives from the authorities, is through "an increase in terror" and dictatorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>.

Despite the current appearance of stability, the system's efficiency is constantly decreasing due to internal conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. Attempts to strengthen public administration through repression, like arresting governors, lead to "paralysis of the state apparatus" rather than efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.

### Demand for Change and Potential Triggers

A colossal demand for change and freedom exists within Russian society, shared by over two-thirds, possibly three-quarters, of the population, a level not seen since 1990-1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. However, there are no clearly expressed subjects of change or a unified, holistic ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. The "Russian people" are seen as "sleeping," with dead villages and an urban lumpen that only formally calls itself a people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>. Their consciousness is virtualized and detached from traditional "soil" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>.

The potential for protest is significant, as evidenced by local movements in Khabarovsk and Bashkiria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>. The unpredictable nature of mass political dynamics means a "trigger" is needed to activate this potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:31">[00:35:31]</a>.

Potential national triggers could include:
*   **Economic collapse:** A rapid, significant devaluation of the ruble (e.g., another 30-40% in a week) followed by a denomination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. The current leadership is reportedly unwilling to engage in a new war, unlike 2014, making economic factors more potent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:32">[00:39:32]</a>.
*   **Political transit:** Internal power struggles within the elite, where one faction, realizing it's losing, might "use the resource" of society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. Once society is engaged, the process becomes unpredictable, like squeezing toothpaste out of a tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.

Despite external pressure and sanctions from non-public organizations aiming to maintain global balance, the fate of Russia will ultimately be decided by its people, who possess "free will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>. This principle acknowledges the limitations of manipulative mechanisms and the unpredictable nature of popular action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>. The belief in a "world government" among half the Russian population, including the authorities, is seen as a "cognitive problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>, as it distracts from national interests and genuine governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

The speaker concludes that an "surprisingly eventful end of this year and next year" is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. The responsibility lies with individuals to act according to conscience, civic feeling, and responsibility to their people and homeland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.

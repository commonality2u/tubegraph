Valery Solovyov's YouTube channel, in the fifth episode of "Answers to Hot Questions," addresses numerous inquiries regarding the potential second stage of [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | mobilization]] [00:00:26]. This potential [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] was previously warned to begin after the New Year holidays [00:00:58].

## Reliability of Information
Solovyov emphasizes the high reliability of his information, drawing parallels to his prior predictions [00:03:48]. He states that he began discussing the inevitability of an armed confrontation between Russia and Ukraine months before February 24, 2022, even pinpointing the date within a week [00:03:57]. He also consistently reported, starting in the spring, that a decision had been made for [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] (initially not knowing it would be "partial") and the introduction of martial law [00:04:55]. Partial [[mobilization_and_legal_grounds | mobilization]] was declared on September 21, and martial law was introduced on October 20, aligning with his predictions [00:05:33]. While acknowledging that nothing is absolutely inevitable except death and taxes, he stresses a "high, high probability" of the second stage of [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] [00:06:05].

## Purpose of Information Dissemination
Solovyov repeatedly shares this information to achieve two main goals:
1.  **Influence Decision-Making** The wider the information spreads, the more chances there are that the "Supreme Authority" will hesitate before making the decision for [[potential_future_mobilization_and_military_strategies | mobilization]], or implement it with less severity [00:06:42]. Dissemination of information can either cancel a decision or influence its adoption [00:07:07].
2.  **Prepare the Populace** Being forewarned allows people to be forearmed [00:07:50]. Solovyov aims to help people prepare for potential upcoming events [00:08:09].

## The "National Test" of Mobilization
Solovyov views the attitude towards [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilization]] as a "general national test" of intelligence, the ability to build cause-and-effect relationships, and the presence of the "will to live" [00:08:24]. He contrasts this with "social maturity," which involves looking at things sensibly and impartially, accepting unpleasant truths, and taking responsibility for one's actions [00:02:01]. He criticizes "infantile" behavior of shielding oneself from reality, suggesting that such people might prefer the comforting narratives of central Russian television [00:02:33].

For those who believe Russia is genuinely threatened and that enemies are encroaching on national wealth, he states it is their duty to fight [00:09:42]. However, he cautions against the idea that participating in conflict will improve one's financial situation or lead to significant compensation [00:10:18]. He warns that those who sacrifice their lives or become breadwinners, and their families, may find their claims for benefits or loan decommissioning dismissed, as "Our history has already been through this" [00:11:03].

He argues that an obedient and passive response to a summons indicates a "weakened survival instinct" and a "lack of will to live" [00:11:48]. He contrasts this with the instinct to survive, where individuals seek opportunities to win or protect themselves and their families [00:11:58].

## Scale and Composition of Potential Mobilization
Solovyov clarifies the figure of two million potentially [[mobilization_and_the_state_of_the_russian_army | mobilized]] individuals, noting that Ukraine [[mobilization_and_military_efforts | mobilized]] one million, and Russia's traditional strategy involves "throwing bodies" at the problem [00:13:12]. This figure includes more than the 300,000 previously reported as [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | mobilized]] [00:13:12].

The two million figure encompasses various roles beyond combat soldiers [00:14:21]:
*   **Medical Personnel** Including doctors and medical staff [00:14:27].
*   **Support Roles** Such as drivers of large transport, signalmen, and cooks [00:14:30]. These individuals do not necessarily receive weapons but are essential for supporting the fighting force [00:14:24].
*   **Engineering and Technical Workers** These individuals might be told they won't take up arms, but they will be on the front lines, under shelling, creating fortification strips [00:14:57]. They may be lured with daily payments (a couple of thousand rubles) and the promise of work experience [00:15:20].

## Logistics and Supplies
Regarding equipment, Solovyov suggests that families will again be responsible for providing bulletproof vests, clothing, and shoes, as was the case during the first stage of [[partial_mobilization_and_its_implications | mobilization]] [00:15:53]. This creates "colossal savings" for the state [00:16:32]. He also mentions that machine guns are available in warehouses and will be subsidized by North Korea, while uniforms will come from Iran [00:16:38]. Belarus, however, is unwilling to provide uniforms [00:16:48].

## New Mobilization Methods
Authorities plan to learn from past mistakes in distributing summonses [00:17:17]. Future [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]] efforts will be harsher [00:18:41]:
*   **Workplace Checkpoints** Summonses will not be limited to apartments, which people have learned not to open [00:17:24]. Instead, checkpoints will be set up at plants and office centers to immediately detain individuals [00:17:53].
*   **Martial Law Implications** The legal restriction against going to workplaces to serve summonses will be lifted once martial law applies to more regions [00:17:36].
*   **Integrated Databases** Information about individuals' places of work will be obtained from integrated databases, including the pension fund, state services, and traffic police [00:18:06].
*   **Face Recognition** Face recognition systems will receive photographs of those potentially subject to [[mobilization_process_and_exemptions | mobilization]] [00:18:22].
*   **Employer Obligations** All employers were obligated to hand over information about military-liable employees by November 1 [00:18:32].

## Strategic and Financial Advice
Solovyov offers one strategic piece of advice: use one's intelligence and will to live to make decisions [00:18:55]. He laments that while Russian society is socially cruel, it is also "stupid," with a prevalent "weakness of life" [00:19:22]. He urges listeners to fight for their "only life," emphasizing that it is "not a computer game" and no compensation will truly make up for loss [00:19:49].

From a financial perspective, he advises having cash on hand, as the Russian banking and financial system is expected to collapse [00:20:09]. While there will be no shortage of food or vodka, there will be a shortage of what is considered money [00:20:50]. He suggests that currency (dollars, euros) will remain valuable, and even if banned, a black market will emerge [00:21:11].

He concludes by encouraging socially mature people to look at life sensibly, prepare for challenges, and utilize their intellect and will to live, rather than "hiding their face in their mother's skirt" [00:21:39].

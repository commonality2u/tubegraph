## Overview
This article examines the status of [[military_operations_and_strategic_goals | military operations]] in Ukraine and the notable changes in military command within Russia. It also delves into the potential for leadership changes at the highest levels of the Russian government and their anticipated [[impact_of_leadership_changes_on_Russian_political_climate | impact on Russia's political and economic stability]].

## State of Military Operations
The recording of this program on June 5th marks 100 days since the start of the special [[military_operations_and_strategic_goals | military operation]] in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. Despite the duration, a decisive "breakthrough" is not yet visible for either side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

Russian authorities have reportedly issued instructions not to emphasize the operation's duration, suggesting it is not proceeding as a "blitzkrieg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. Although official propaganda insists "everything is going according to plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, certain signs indicate otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

A positive development noted is that the idea of delivering tactical nuclear strikes on Ukraine is currently "off the agenda," possibly due to the Russian president's location in an underground bomb shelter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

### Military Leadership Changes
There have been significant shifts in Russian [[military_and_political_analysis | military command]]:
*   In early April, Commander Dvornikov, a former "hero" of the Syrian campaign, was appointed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   However, Dvornikov reportedly disappeared from public view approximately two weeks prior to June 5th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   According to unconfirmed information, the operation now has a new command under Colonel General Gennady Zhidko, who also received the Hero of Russia star for his participation in the Syrian campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

The frequent changes in military commanders overseeing the operation, especially after only a little over a month, suggest that things are unlikely to be proceeding according to plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. This contrasts with official claims of the operation's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### Peace Consultations and Proposed Formulas
Western participants, including the United States, Great Britain, and the European Union, are holding consultations on a "peace formula" for the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. These discussions have been conducted without Ukraine's direct participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

The proposed Italian formula includes:
*   Ukraine declaring itself a neutral, non-bloc state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
*   Crimea and Donbass receiving full autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   Russian troops withdrawing to their positions as of February 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   Commencement of large-scale negotiations on Crimea and Donbass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

This formula is considered unlikely to suit either the Russian Federation or Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. Russia currently controls significant territories including the Kherson region, most of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, and a considerable part of the Zaporozhye region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. Practical steps are being taken to integrate these areas into or alongside the Russian Federation, such as issuing Russian passports, introducing Russian mobile operators, and making the ruble an official currency in the Kherson region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

Ukraine is unlikely to agree to such conditions after the sacrifices it has made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. However, Ukraine could potentially be "forced" to agree if weapon supplies from Western countries were to stop or be insufficient to achieve a strategic counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>. "Old Europe" (Germany, France, Italy) may favor this approach, while Great Britain, Poland, the Baltic countries, and the United States currently resist it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.

## Impact of Potential Leadership Changes
There are increasing discussions about the deteriorating health of the Russian president in Western media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>. For Moscow officials and the highest echelons of federal bureaucracy, the idea that the president will have to leave is already a "common place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>. This understanding is leading to a noticeable disorganization of the administrative apparatus, as officials question the risks of taking action when the system's future is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>. This parallels the disorganization observed in Soviet offices during the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990-1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.

### Mechanisms for Concealing Leadership Status
To conceal the president's potential health issues or changes, several measures are being discussed:
*   The use of doubles, one of whom is reportedly "absolutely identical" with two tiny differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05:00">[16:05:00]</a>. These doubles might be used even during official meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.
*   Augmented reality for video messages and conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a>.
*   Pre-recorded "canned" meetings and speeches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31:00">[16:31:00]</a>.

### Future of the Political System
The departure of the president would fundamentally change the Russian system, which is centered around him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. If the "core" of the system disappears, it will begin to fall apart, likely not over decades, but within years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>.

A State Council is reportedly being formed, with the president selecting its personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a>. This "terrarium of like-minded people" was previously reconciled and stabilized by the president's loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:28:00">[17:28:00]</a>. However, it is doubtful that this system will remain united if the president weakens or attempts to govern from behind the scenes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>. The prevailing belief is that "without Putin, the Putin system is impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:00:00">[18:00:00]</a>.

Such [[potential_changes_in_Russian_leadership_and_implications | potential changes in Russian leadership]] could also affect the Russian economy. Some experts suggest that the economy might face "serious problems," with August being identified as a "fatal month" for the financial sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. These problems could stem from cyberattacks on the banking system or an international economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

While the exact nature of future political developments is uncertain, the end of summer 2022 is anticipated to be "extremely alarming and even unpleasant" in financial and economic relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>. There are doubts that the elections planned for September will actually take place, with a possibility of cancellation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>.

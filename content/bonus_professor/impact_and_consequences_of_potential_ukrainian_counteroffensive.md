The anticipation of an upcoming [[Ukrainian and Russian military pressures and potential compromises | Ukrainian counteroffensive]] is leading to significant legal and social changes in Russia, primarily aimed at facilitating mobilization to compensate for expected losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The Russian armed forces are expected to demand compensation for potential serious losses among both attacking and defending sides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Context for Mobilization

Recruitment campaigns for contract soldiers in the Russian armed forces are reportedly failing, particularly in large cities like Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This failure necessitates a mobilization process to compensate for anticipated losses from the counteroffensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Legal Changes Formalizing Mobilization

On April 11, a significant legal event occurred, formalizing the legal status and consequences of mobilization through amendments to the unified register of persons liable for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Electronic Summonses

Electronic summonses are now legally equivalent to paper ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. They are considered automatically received the moment they are posted in a person's public services account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This applies to all individuals liable for military service, not just conscripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. While this rule does not apply to the spring draft, it is relevant for mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Restrictive Measures for Draft Dodgers

Expanded restrictive measures, or penalties, will affect not only conscripts but all those liable for military service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

If a person fails to appear voluntarily within two weeks of receiving a summons (including digital ones, even if they claim not to have received it or have closed their public services account), a notification of restrictions will be introduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

These restrictions include:
*   **Travel ban:** Inability to leave the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   **Driving ban:** Prohibition from driving vehicles, effectively canceling licenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Real estate transactions:** Inability to buy or sell property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Entrepreneurship ban:** Inability to register as an individual entrepreneur, likely extending to conducting economic activity as one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Loan ban:** Prohibition from taking out loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Bank account blocking:** Although not explicitly stated in the amendments, this is expected to be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

These measures are designed to compel individuals to appear for military service if mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## Scope of Potential Mobilization

These changes could affect over 20 million citizens, potentially up to 27 million, who could be mobilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. More than 14 million people are already in the non-departure database for various reasons, including unpaid alimony or minor debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Advice for Citizens

Citizens face a dilemma regarding their duty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. One choice is to accept the summons, risking death or serious injury, possibly for financial gain which is not guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The other choice is to prioritize duty to oneself, family, and friends, recognizing that promises of care from authorities are unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Practical advice given includes:
1.  **Stay calm and don't panic:** There is time to act, likely until at least the May holidays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
2.  **Manage public services account:** Consider if having an account on public services, where electronic summonses are sent, is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
3.  **Consult legal professionals for asset protection:** General powers of attorney may not be sufficient due to personal restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Consider rewriting rights to trusted individuals for property or cars, but seek legal counsel due to inherent risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
4.  **Prepare a plan:** Observe the situation, think about responses if critical decisions are made, and prepare multiple options, discussing them with family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Agree on mutual assistance and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

While going abroad is an option, it is not feasible for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

This article summarizes discussions on the [[internal_political_situation_in_russia | internal political situation in Russia]], as presented in the sixth episode of the "Answers to Hot Questions" program, broadcast on Thursday, June 27, at 1 PM Moscow time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. The program addresses questions submitted by viewers under a video posted on Monday, prioritizing the most popular, relevant, interesting, and curious queries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.

## Current Leadership and Speculation

The speaker addresses questions regarding the current President of Russia, referring to him as "Evgeny Vasilyevich who plays the role of the President of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:55">[01:53:55]</a>. It is suggested that he is "directed through micro-earphones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, lacks his own will, and is "actually not even actually and legally also under house arrest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. The idea of a "double Vasilyevich" performing presidential duties is also discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

It is asserted that if it is publicly announced that a double has been performing the President's duties, it would become a "world sensation" and a "world shock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. Despite this, the speaker believes Western governments are aware of the situation but find it "suits them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Future revelations are expected to be "extremely unpleasant" but necessary for society to understand that "evil is punishable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

The speaker notes that many politicians avoid discussing the possibility of a double because they are "either afraid to talk about it" or "interested in maintaining the myth that Putin is alive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. A change in leadership is considered inevitable and would lead to the establishment of a "new Russian Republic," as the former one was "destroyed irrevocably" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

Regarding "shamans" who supposedly predicted Putin's future, it is claimed they predicted well but were "categorically mistaken in their prediction," leading to their cruel punishment, though this was not reported in opposition channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

## Proposed Changes by the Speaker's Team

The speaker represents a "team" planning to seize power in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. They aim to change the [[internal_political_developments_in_russia | historical trajectory of Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:20:00">[37:20:00]</a>.

### Declassification and Accountability
The team intends to declassify KGB and FSB documents, with the exception of "top secret units" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. They plan to expose the names of all informers who worked against Russian society, asserting that "no one will hide, all this is recorded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>. This is meant to ensure that such events "never happen again" and that people are aware "evil is punishable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

### Legal and Societal Reforms
*   **Withdrawal of Troops:** Russian troops will be withdrawn from Ukraine when a peace agreement is signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
*   **Illegitimate Rule:** All laws, decrees, and agreements signed during the "illegitimate period of rule" will be "swept away by the changes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.
*   **Dima Yakovlev's Law:** This law will "certainly be repealed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:18:00">[18:18:00]</a>, and those who initiated it, harming children in orphanages, will face "fair punishment according to the law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>.
*   **Monuments to "Heroes":** The speaker states the team has a "very definite point of view" on what will happen to these monuments, but does not elaborate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.
*   **Public Transport Costs:** The team plans to reduce travel costs through subsidies, particularly for air travel, and significantly increase the income of Russian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:40:00">[28:40:00]</a>.
*   **Denomination:** A denomination of banknotes is an "inevitable stage in the exit from the financial and economic crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:05:00">[28:05:00]</a>.

### Law Enforcement and Military
*   **Law Enforcement Agencies:** Serious changes are expected in "all law enforcement agencies" in the fall of this year, including the Investigative Committee headed by Bastrykin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
*   **Russian Guard:** The speaker states they "do not really understand the point of the existence of this organization" and it will be liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>.
*   **FSB:** The FSB will undergo "the most serious transformations," including "radical, radical reform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:25:00">[39:25:00]</a>. Special services are deemed necessary for any state with serious interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:27:00">[39:27:00]</a>.
*   **Second Wave of Mobilization:** The chances of a second wave are currently "not very high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:50:00">[18:50:00]</a>, but the possibility is not "absolutely excluded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:01:00">[19:01:00]</a>. Progressive forces are working to avoid it, with discussions expected at the end of summer or early autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:12:00">[19:12:00]</a>.
*   **Military Personnel Accountability:** Those who committed crimes during the conflict will be held accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:58:00">[29:58:00]</a>. Those who did not will bear moral responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:04:00">[30:04:00]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that "personal responsibility cannot be denied" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:43:00">[30:43:00]</a>.
*   **Returning "Heroes" and Criminals:** For those returning from conflict zones with mental problems, the team plans to implement a program, including psychiatric registration and special medications, drawing on the experience of other countries and Russia's own past conflicts (Afghanistan, Chechen wars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:52:00">[40:52:00]</a>.

### Economic and Social Development
*   **Environmental Control:** The team plans to "raise the control" over pollution to "one of the absolutes" to ensure an "ecologically clean environment" and quality food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>.
*   **Regional Development:** The team aims to foster regional development by creating "new development centers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:23:00">[24:23:00]</a>. This will begin with "budgetary federalism," allowing regions a larger share of their income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:32:00">[24:32:00]</a>. The ultimate goal is the "transformation of Russia into a federation in deeds and not in words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:00">[25:05:00]</a>.
*   **Retirement Age:** The team plans to return to "original values" for the retirement age and then consider equalizing it for men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.
*   **Negligent Developers:** Developers who use low-quality materials will be "punished" and required to pay compensation, necessitating changes to the legislative base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>.
*   **Urban Exodus (De-urbanization):** A program of "de-urbanization" will be launched to financially support people of age to resettle in rural areas for village revival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:46:00">[37:46:00]</a>. This would be possible by not financing military actions and stopping "Homeric scale" stealing, which would provide "a second or even a third budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:52:00">[37:52:00]</a>.

### Cultural and Historical Aspects
*   **Mausoleum:** The Mausoleum will not be torn down, as it is considered a "monument of architecture, history, culture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:54:00">[26:54:00]</a>. It can be converted into a museum of "Russian banners," representing various historical periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Education:** The team aims to make historical and humanitarian education "truthful" and improve the quality of school education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:00">[17:30:00]</a>. This includes covering the "true story of what happened to Russia" over the last quarter-century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47:00">[16:47:00]</a>, even if unpleasant, to ensure people understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>.

### Migration Policy
The team will introduce a "new comprehensive policy in relation to migration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:52:00">[25:52:00]</a>. This includes:
1.  Reducing the visa regime to control migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:00">[26:00:00]</a>.
2.  Directing migrants to areas where they are needed, rather than where conditions are perceived as "fatter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:09:00">[26:09:00]</a>.

## External Relations and Hybrid Operations
*   **Hybrid Operation in Baltics:** Specific options for implementing a "hybrid operation" in relation to the Baltic countries (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia) are being discussed for the "turn of September October" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>. This is presented as "the most important information" for those living in Belarus, Kaliningrad region, and the Baltic states to prepare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:30:00">[20:30:00]</a>. Network interruptions in Latvia are noted as "testing of the tools of the hybrid operation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:41:00">[32:41:00]</a>.
*   **Vietnam's Participation:** Vietnam's participation in a "circus with doubles" (referring to the Russian leadership) was driven by offers of beneficial projects and a remembrance of Soviet assistance in their national independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:21:00">[38:21:00]</a>.

## Other Topics
*   **Party's Gold:** The speaker states they do not know the current location of the "Party's gold" (assets of the late President Putin and his family, consisting of "tens of tons of dollars and other convertible currencies," precious metals, and stones) which were reportedly moved from Africa to Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.
*   **Colonel Shendakov:** Colonel Shendakov was arrested in Russia due to his "directness" and "frankness" about current events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00:00">[33:00:00]</a>.
*   **MH17 Downing:** The downing of Boeing 17 (MH17) was a "mistake" and not the work of Strelkov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:13:00">[34:13:00]</a>. "Other people are responsible for this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:32:00">[34:32:00]</a>.
*   **Currency Circulation:** Banning the circulation of currency in Russia is considered "almost unbelievable" and "counterproductive," as a "black market will not go anywhere" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:17:00">[29:17:00]</a>.

The speaker, Valery Dmitrievich, encourages listeners to follow the Telegram and YouTube channels of General SVR for "operationally important" information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:47:00">[19:47:00]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of public support, including financial assistance, for the team's efforts to change the [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian sociopolitical dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:13:00">[43:13:00]</a>.

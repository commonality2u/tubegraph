## Criticism of Russian Government and Leadership

A group close to the current Russian leader reportedly hopes he will guide their "multi-billion dollar assets" to a "quiet harbor" to escape the current turbulent situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Igor Strelkov is noted to have sarcastically commented on Vladimir's stability as an "undoubted sign of mastery" in his recent actions, such as OPEC+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

It is suggested that decisions made by the leadership are "not very well executed" due to a lack of a clear "vertical of power" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. A small, unified group, bound by "common blood," is in a position with no easy escape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Mikhail Delyagin has described the current Russian power structure as "female able gangs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. It's noted that the reality of "who ruled Russia and how" could "seriously damage the psyche" if fully understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Economic Policies and Promises
There is skepticism regarding President Putin's proposal for 6.5% annual mortgages for citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Experts question how such lending can be provided when the national currency collapses by 30% after certain events, and when the Central Bank claims it is not responsible for the currency's rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The impression is that the government is trying to devise solutions without spending budget money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Promises of cheap loans from the president are viewed with cynicism, as conditions are expected to be nearly impossible to meet, limiting access to very few individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Banks are also unlikely to comply if it's unprofitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This highlights that the "will of the president" does not work in practice when it comes to giving or building, only when it involves prohibiting or taking bribes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

### Response to Crisis and Fines
The state is criticized for only being able to "humiliate people and take from them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Examples include elderly people being fined 500 rubles in Mordovia for being on their porch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, and 25,000 rubles in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. In contrast, the US government gave citizens $1200 in assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>, while Russia promised a minimum wage for registered employees if they get out of quarantine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This approach is described as "utilitarian" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### Pass System and Sobyanin's Management
The widely announced pass system in Moscow led to chaos, with long queues at metro entrances and traffic jams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Independent bloggers found no traffic police at key junctions, only workers installing cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. The implementation was criticized for failing to foresee basic issues, suggesting a lack of management talent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Moscow Mayor Sobyanin's order to check every pass caused massive queues because he "does not understand at all how life is arranged" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. This blunder caused internal political infighting among different groups like Shoigu's and Sobyanin's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

## Public Perception of Government and WHO

### Views on Epidemic Data
A poll indicates that the Russian population is divided into three roughly equal groups regarding the official epidemic data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.
*   **30%** believe authorities are hiding the true picture and underestimating infection and death rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
*   **29%** believe the official data is correct and reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   **28%** believe the virus threat is being exaggerated and used by authorities to cover up their "sins and affairs," such as losses in OPEC+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

The approval of self-isolation measures decreased by 10% in one week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. Presidential administration's internal sociology is reportedly so negative that they are afraid to lift quarantine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

### WHO's Role and Criticism
The World Health Organization (WHO) is seen as a "typical international bureaucratic organization" that exists to "reproduce itself and to receive profit from various kinds of dubious companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. There are accusations that WHO "did nothing for early warning" regarding the current epidemic, and that it was likely "corrupted by the Chinese government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Donald Trump's position to cut funding is supported, drawing parallels to the FIFA corruption scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The death of tens of thousands of people is attributed to the "conscience of the functionaries" who allowed the Chinese to "camouflage" the epidemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. The US is expected to initiate corruption investigations into WHO activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Potential for Political Change
The current mood in Russia is highly negative, making it difficult to conduct a plebiscite on the constitution or hold elections in the fall without consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. The economic situation is expected to worsen by autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>. There are discussions within the Kremlin about preparing political reforms, including potentially canceling gubernatorial elections starting this fall and removing around 20 governors, some of whom could go to prison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:57">[00:26:57]</a>.

The speaker notes that information about such reforms often comes from sources like Peskov (the president's press secretary) and high-ranking FSB officers, suggesting it is partly accurate ("echoes of some really older ska discussions") and partly fabricated for public opinion manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:05">[00:27:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.

### Public Dissatisfaction and Future Protests
There is growing "class hatred" among the population due to the government's perceived detachment and ineffective policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. The public's [[Public dissatisfaction and political implications in Russia | irritation]] with propaganda posters that seem to mock their situation is increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:40">[00:31:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

The quarantine is expected to last until at least June 1st, potentially leading to widespread business closures and mass unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>. This is seen as a "control shot in the head" for the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:43">[00:35:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>. Given that 60-65% of Russian families did not have enough money for even one month of quarantine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>, it's questioned how they will endure further isolation.

While society shows sharp increases in aggressiveness and irritation, it is not yet ready for mass demonstrations in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:11">[00:39:11]</a>. Local conflicts and deviant behavior are expected to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:13">[00:39:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:16">[00:39:16]</a>. The "charge" to scare people into staying home has largely worked in Moscow, leading to empty streets and deserted metro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>.

However, the speaker believes a turning point in public consciousness is coming rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:12">[00:43:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. The political agenda will likely simplify to "the resignation of the president and government and the formation of the government national saved" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>. This will need to be achieved "on the streets and squares," as elections are not seen as a viable path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. The issue is considered a matter of the "physical existence" and "survival of the nation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:52">[00:43:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.

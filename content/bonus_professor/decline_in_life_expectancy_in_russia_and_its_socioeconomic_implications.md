Recent statistics reveal a concerning trend in male life expectancy in Russia, highlighting the [[economic_and_social_consequences_in_russia | economic and social consequences]] of the current government's policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. This situation is described as the "apotheosis of Putin's economic and social policy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:28">[00:19:28]</a>.

## Key Statistics and Observations

*   **Decreased Male Life Expectancy**: According to a British publication, referencing official Russian statistics, the expected life expectancy of men in the Russian Federation for 2019-2021 decreased by almost 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.
    *   The reported figure for male life expectancy stands at "604 years 64.2" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
*   **Failure to Reach Retirement Age**: On average, Russian men do not even live to the new retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. This fulfills "The great dream of Russian [[economic_challenges_faced_by_russian_households | economic and social]] cannibals: Live humbly like cattle, die quickly, does not receive a pension" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

## Societal Impact and Future Policy Goals

This decline is seen as a direct outcome of Putin's economic and social policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>.

In response to this, a different approach is proposed for any future government:
*   **Reduced Retirement Age**: One of the first steps of a new government would be to reduce the retirement age, returning to previous values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.
*   **Pension Compensation**: Compensation would be paid to all individuals or their heirs for the pension they did not receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
*   **Investment in the Future**: Financial support from citizens is seen as an investment in their own future, and the future of their children and grandchildren, considered the "most profitable investment" at present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

The year 2023 is projected to be a decisive year in Russia's recent history, with hopes for a breakthrough for freedom, dignity, and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:52">[00:23:52]</a>.

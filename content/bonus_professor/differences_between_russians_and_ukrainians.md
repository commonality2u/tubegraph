There are empirically clear differences between the behavior of Russians and Ukrainians, including Ukrainians who grew up and lived in Ukraine for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. These differences are observed in behavior and style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

Ukrainians are perceived as more pragmatic and cunning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. The speaker clarifies that "cunning" is not used in a negative sense, akin to shrewdness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Additionally, Ukrainians are noted as being "more clean" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Post-Conflict Relations

Building relationships between Ukrainians and citizens of the Russian Federation after [[russian_military_operations_in_ukraine | military actions]] cease will be very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. While economic ties may recover relatively quickly, human ties are unlikely to recover quickly, if at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>.

In the eyes of Ukrainians, influenced by history textbooks and propaganda, Russia and Russians will likely be seen as a source of evil and threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>. If socialization is built on this spirit, nothing good can be expected in relations between the societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.

However, there is still hope, as exemplified by the historical relations between Germany and France from the late 19th century through the 20th century. Despite being extremely complicated and burdened by destructive wars where both sides suffered crushing defeats, they were eventually able to establish and build relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

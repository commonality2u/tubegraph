According to Valery Solovey, the outcome of the [[military_and_political_situation_in_ukraine | military conflict]] will be predetermined even before the summer of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This does not imply an automatic cessation of [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | military actions]], which could continue due to fading inertia and attempts to find a political solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Solovey expresses optimism regarding the conflict's duration, disagreeing with the Pentagon's view that [[escalation_of_military_action_between_russia_and_ukraine | military actions]] could drag on for three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Post-Putin Scenario
The cessation of [[international_relations_and_military_actions_concerning_ukraine | military actions]] is heavily dependent on who assumes power after Vladimir Putin's removal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. If the most likely contenders for power take control, [[international_military_assistance_to_ukraine | military actions]] may not automatically cease; they could even experience a short-term intensification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This potential escalation would serve to bargain for better conditions for [[russian_troop_withdrawal_from_ukraine | Russia's exit from Ukraine]] and the end of the armed confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Potential Outcomes and Peace Conditions
The likelihood of a "conditionally Korean version" of the conflict, involving a frozen conflict and deep self-isolation for Russia, is considered extremely low, tending to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Regarding [[prospects_for_ending_the_russiaukraine_conflict | peace conditions]], Solovey states that the West is preparing to offer terms to the Russian Federation that do not include any hint of national humiliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. This approach is informed by historical experience, particularly the aftermath of the First World War, where national humiliation led to revanchist sentiments and the rise of Nazism in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

## Minsk Agreements
The Minsk agreements were seen as a "fiction" by all parties involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:51">[00:24:51]</a>.
*   **Ukrainian Side and Western Supporters** sought to gain time, viewing it as a "Brest Peace" for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.
*   **Russian Side** aimed to legitimize its broader plans for Ukraine, intending to influence Ukraine through the agreements, integrate Donbass, change Ukraine's Constitution, and effectively turn Ukraine into a confederate state critically dependent on Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

Therefore, all parties were "not very honest" in their adherence to the agreements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

## Broader Implications and Future
While there are risks of internal weakening and the revival of separatist tendencies in Russia, Solovey does not believe there are fundamental risks of Russia's disintegration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. A theoretical disintegration is only possible if a political crisis in Russia is very long and fierce, potentially lasting around three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

The speaker believes that 2023 holds the chance for the fate of Russia to begin to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:54">[00:34:54]</a>.

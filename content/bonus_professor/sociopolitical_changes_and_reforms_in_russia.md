From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The speaker outlines various planned and anticipated [[future_political_changes_in_russia | political and social changes in Russia]] should his team come to power. These include significant reforms in governance, law enforcement, social welfare, and environmental policy, aiming to transform Russia into a more just, prosperous, and ecologically sound nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

## Presidential Rule and Legitimacy

The current individual playing the role of the President of Russia, Evgeny Vasilyevich, is described as being directed through micro-earphones, having no will of his own, and being under house arrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
It is planned that it will be publicly announced that a double has been performing the president's duties for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This revelation is expected to become a "world shock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, though Western governments are aware and it suits them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Establishing a New Republic
The speaker asserts that the current period of rule is illegitimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. All signed agreements, issued decrees, and amended laws from this period will be swept away by forthcoming changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. The establishment of a new Russian Republic is deemed inevitable, as the former republic established in 1991-1993 was irrevocably destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Justice and Transparency

### Declassification of Archives
Upon a change of power, KGB/FSB documents are assumed to be opened and declassified, with the exception of top-secret units which are always retained in archives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The statute of limitations will be applied automatically, leading to the opening of archives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Revealing Informers
The names of all informers who worked against and within Russian society will be revealed and published <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This information is recorded despite any promises made by the Armed Forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Society will need to prepare for an "avalanche of extremely unpleasant revelations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This is intended to ensure that such events never happen again, to make people aware, and to ensure that evil is punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Handling Past Actions and Responsibility
*   **Military Personnel**: Individuals who committed crimes during the conflict in Ukraine will be held accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>. Those who did not commit crimes will bear moral responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:04">[00:30:04]</a>. The aim is for people to understand the terrible events that happened and their personal share of responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:20">[00:30:20]</a>. Moral responsibility is an individual category, not collective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>.
*   **Historical Education**: The true story of what happened to Russia, especially over the last quarter-century, needs to be covered and reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. This history should become part of school socialization, presented honestly and impartially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. The quality of school and humanitarian education will be improved to ensure truthfulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

### Fate of Specific Laws and Officials
*   **Dima Yakovlev's Law**: This law, which prohibited U.S. citizens from adopting Russian children, will be repealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Those who initiated it, harming unfortunate children, will be subject to fair punishment according to the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>.
*   **Russian Guard**: This organization, believed to be created for Putin's personal use, will be liquidated, as its practical meaning and logic are questioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Colonel Shendakov**: His arrest in Russia was due to his directness and frankness regarding current events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.

## Law Enforcement and Military Reforms

### Changes in Law Enforcement Agencies
Serious [[future_political_changes_in_russia | changes]] are expected in all law enforcement agencies, including the Investigative Committee, in the fall of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. These changes may involve changes in deputies or overall leadership, not necessarily the top leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Transformation of the FSB
The FSB (Federal Security Service) will undergo "radical, radical reform," described as the most large-scale and profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>. While special services like counterintelligence and foreign intelligence are necessary for any state, especially one like Russia with serious interests, the current structure requires fundamental change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:27">[00:39:27]</a>.

### Demobilization and Veteran Support
Addressing the issue of returning soldiers and criminals from the conflict with mental problems, the speaker states that the current "Politburo 2.0" is not addressing this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>. However, the speaker's team has a plan to deal with this, which involves registering people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for psychiatric or special registration and providing them with specific medications to facilitate their reintegration into society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>. This program draws on the experience of other countries and Russia's own past conflicts (Afghanistan, Chechen wars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.

## Social and Economic Reforms

### Retirement Age
The speaker notes that there is reason to consider establishing the same retirement age for men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. The initial plan is to return to the original retirement age values, followed by potential equalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. A detailed economic and social development plan for Russia, including this, exists and will be made public later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

### Regional Development and Federalism
The current situation where everything converges in Moscow is deemed "unhealthy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. The plan is to create new development centers in regions by stimulating them, focusing on budgetary federalism, and allowing regions a larger share of regional income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. The ultimate goal is to transform Russia into a federation "in deeds and not in words," requiring people to bear responsibility for their land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

### Migration Policy
Current migration to Russia is described as uncontrolled, chaotic, spontaneous, and dangerous for the traditional way of life, identity, national security, and character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. A new comprehensive migration policy will be introduced, starting with a reduction of the visa regime to enable control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>. Migrants will be sent where they are needed, not necessarily where it is "fatter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>, for example, to modernize ports along the Northern Arctic Route <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.

### Environmental Control
Due to concerns about spoiled ecology from oil drilling on agricultural land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, the speaker's team plans to raise pollution control to "one of the absolutes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. This is based on the desire for Russians to live in an ecologically clean environment and eat quality food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### Urban De-urbanization and Rural Support
There are plans to launch and finance a program of "de-urbanization of Russia" to support people resettling in rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>. This will be possible by ceasing military actions and reducing corruption, which would effectively create a "second or even a third budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.

## Cultural and Historical Aspects

### Lenin's Burial and Mausoleum's Future
Lenin is expected to be buried "sooner rather than later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. The Mausoleum itself will not be torn down, as it is considered a monument of architecture, history, and culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. Instead, it can be transformed into a "museum of Russian banners," displaying flags from various historical periods of Russia, including pre-Peter the Great eras, Imperial Russia, the Soviet Banner, and modern Russia's banner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

## Financial and Economic Outlook

### Currency Denomination
A denomination of the currency is an inevitable stage for Russia to exit its financial and economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:05">[00:28:05]</a>. Recommendations to stock up on dollars and euros were given to protect against risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. Banning currency circulation is deemed "almost unbelievable" and counterproductive, as a black market would persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

### Transportation Costs and Income
While public transport and taxi costs might be regulated, reducing train and plane tickets can be achieved through subsidies, which are "absolutely necessary" for a vast country like Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. The primary policy approach, however, will be a significant, gradual, and constant increase in the income of Russian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>, making tickets more affordable.

## Overcoming Cyclical History
The speaker asserts that Russia can "tear itself out of this cycle" of repetition, referring to the phrase "nothing has changed in 20 years, everything is still repeating itself cyclically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. This requires a group in power with an action plan and public support. The speaker claims that his team currently possesses "almost all the necessary components" to change Russia's historical trajectory and avoid walking in a vicious circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.

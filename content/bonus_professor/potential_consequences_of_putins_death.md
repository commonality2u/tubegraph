Professor Valery Solovey has outlined several potential consequences following the physical death of Vladimir Putin, stating that these events are expected to unfold before the end of autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Immediate Aftermath and Public Reaction
Upon [[death_of_vladimir_putin_and_new_reality_in_russia | Putin's death]], the authorities will initially attempt to conceal the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. However, this concealment is expected to be short-lived, potentially lasting only a few hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Information regarding the physical, though not political, death of Putin will quickly reach society and the elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Contrary to some expectations, not everyone will rejoice at [[death_of_vladimir_putin_and_new_reality_in_russia | Putin's death]]; many may express regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>, and fear of instability might become the prevailing mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

## Political and Societal Shifts
Following the announcement of [[death_of_vladimir_putin_and_new_reality_in_russia | Putin's death]]:
*   **Elite Movement** The elite, including regional figures, will begin to shift, and a broader movement will commence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Period of Chaos** After a period of short-term stability, Russia will "most likely plunge into chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Efforts will be made to ensure this chaos is short-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Judicial Accountability** There is a strong expectation that trials for "real criminals" who committed crimes against humanity, society, their people, and their country will begin as early as next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Role of Key Figures
*   **[[potential_return_of_prigozhin_and_speculation_on_putins_death | Prigozhin's Return]]** It is anticipated that [[potential_return_of_prigozhin_and_speculation_on_putins_death | Prigozhin]], who is reportedly alive and well in Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>, will appear soon after [[death_of_vladimir_putin_and_new_reality_in_russia | Putin's death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. He intends to disclose "a lot of interesting things," particularly regarding the existence of [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | doubles]] of the Russian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. [[potential_return_of_prigozhin_and_speculation_on_putins_death | Prigozhin]] is expected to become part of a broader alliance rather than acting independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Fate of Current Officials** Sergey Shoigu and Dmitry Peskov are not expected to fare well after [[death_of_vladimir_putin_and_new_reality_in_russia | Putin's death]]; they have little influence and their fate will be "deplorable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>.
*   **Decline of the Putin Family** The positions of the Putin family are weakening, and a member of his family intends to leave Russia and go abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

## International Reactions and Dynamics
*   **Acceptance of a Double** Western countries and China are prepared to engage with a [[rumors_of_vladimir_putins_death_and_its_implications | double]] of Putin, as they prioritize maintaining the status quo and political stability in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. Their primary interest lies in preserving control over Russia's nuclear arsenal and ensuring the continued flow of raw materials (for China) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. This policy is deemed "hypocritical and two-faced" in relation to Russian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

## Opportunities for Russia
Despite the predicted chaos, the period after [[death_of_vladimir_putin_and_new_reality_in_russia | Putin's death]] presents an opportunity for Russia to transition to a "correct, free, competitive, and competitive development" path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. This transformative period is expected to be more significant than the changes of the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

### Administrative-Territorial Structure
In the new Russia, the goal is to transform the country from a nominal federation into an actual one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. The first step will be granting greater budgetary independence to the regions of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

### Freedom of Speech
The speaker personally advocates for the American model of freedom of speech, with fewer restrictions than the European model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. However, the final decision will involve society and potentially a constitutional conference and referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.

## Personal Perspective
Valery Solovey maintains an optimistic outlook due to being "well informed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of common sense, which he notes is rarely used in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:16">[00:23:16]</a>. He encourages his audience to stay informed and "live to see" these decisive events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.

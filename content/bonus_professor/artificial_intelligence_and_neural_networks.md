A question was posed regarding the dangers that [[technological_revolution_and_societal_impact | artificial intelligence]] and [[technological_revolution_and_societal_impact | neural networks]] might introduce into daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

In response to a query about having "doubles" and the dangers of [[technological_revolution_and_societal_impact | artificial intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, a speaker addressed the concept of AI-generated likenesses and voices. The speaker acknowledged that an AI could look and speak with their voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. However, they expressed a personal decision that only one person should look and speak like them, and that person would be themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This statement was attributed to a previous joke made by an activist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. The speaker then directly referred to the AI instance as "my first double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

The current [[political situation in Russia]] is characterized by an ongoing struggle for power following the reported death of Vladimir Putin. The speaker's team aims to radically change the situation and the very foundations upon which society and the state in the Russian Federation are based, rather than merely seizing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

## Ruling Coalitions and Power Dynamics
Two main coalitions or groups, those of Patrushev and Chemezov, currently hold strong influence over the domestic agenda in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. These groups dislike each other and avoid personal meetings, preferring to communicate via video conference to discuss and make decisions promptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:57:00">[22:57:00]</a>. The speaker's team does not belong to either of these coalitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

### Patrushev's Group
Nikolai Patrushev, then Secretary of the Security Council, is noted for listening to analysts working under the council's auspices, unlike the late Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. These analysts' forecasts align significantly with the speaker's own predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. Patrushev formulates solutions based on his worldview, though some individuals block his proposed solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

Regarding the war, Patrushev's group favors concluding a peace agreement based on recognizing the territorial status quo, meaning the current front line would become the new border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

### Chemezov's Group
The "Chemezov tower" is described as including Manturov, Dyumin, and a number of high-ranking officers from the FSB (not all FSB officers are guided by Patrushev) and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. Chemezov reportedly has excellent relations with the SVR, which facilitates the acquisition of Western technological achievements for the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

Chemezov's group supports a "very broad and very flexible compromise" concerning the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>.

## Post-Putin Transition
The inability of authorities to carry out a smooth transition after Putin's death is attributed to the ruling groups' failure to agree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. Patrushev had pushed for a swift transition before January 1, 2024, but opposing groups within the ruling coalition were against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. While some agreement appears to have been reached, the actual outcome is expected to become clear closer to autumn 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

The individual performing the duties of the President of Russia, referred to as "Politburo 2.0 Evgeny Vasilyevich," is expected to resign from this post before the end of 2024, likely in autumn or late autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that the "tyrant is dead, but tyranny is alive," meaning a true "post-puncture" system will only emerge once the foundations of tyranny are dismantled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

## Key Figures and Their Status
*   **Vladmir Putin**: The speaker states unequivocally that Putin is dead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:00:00">[36:00:00]</a>. His "double" reportedly has a cognitive fallacy, hoping his fate will be different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>. Former friend Pugachev's claims that it is the same Putin are dismissed, urging listeners to ask when Pugachev last spoke to Putin personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:06:00">[34:06:00]</a>.
*   **Yevgeny Prigozhin**: He is said to have a strong desire for revenge against those he considers enemies and traitors, and will definitely return to the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. He has not undergone plastic surgery but uses wigs and different appearances, as evidenced by various passports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>. Wagner, as an independent, combat-ready unit, has not survived, but individual fragments and elements remain intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:48:00">[31:48:00]</a>.
*   **Sergei Furgal**: He is described as a "classic political prisoner" and will be released after a change of regime, like all political prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.
*   **Pavel Grudinin**: He is currently in "oblivion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
*   **Yury Kovalchuk**: His ability to influence the struggle for the future and determine its vector has significantly decreased, dramatically so after Putin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.
*   **Dmitry Medvedev**: He has not been touched by current reshuffles because "no one needs him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:42:00">[27:42:00]</a>. Under a new government, he would first undergo treatment for alcoholism, and then his fate would be decided "according to the law" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>.
*   **Ilya Yashin**: While any prisoner in Russia can be killed, Yashin is not among the primary targets for special operations against political prisoners; the primary targets are prominent figures of the Russian political emigration who are abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:00:00">[41:00:00]</a>.

## Domestic Issues and Future Outlook
The speaker's team expects sanctions to be lifted quickly under their government due to high-level consultations with Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:04:00">[19:04:00]</a>. The current "import substitution" is largely a shift from Western to Chinese products, which mitigates technical degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:00">[19:29:00]</a>.

Regarding societal issues:
*   **Prisons**: Plans were made to build huge "super-prisons" in 29 regions, financed by the budget (taxes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. This project began due to stable prisoner numbers but has faced questions about financing after the change in [[Russian political dynamics and leadership issues|military-political situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. There is a possibility these could be used as "Stalin-era camps," and the project also appears to involve embezzlement of budget money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.
*   **Animal Protection**: The speaker is categorically against keeping animals in monstrous conditions, like in Russian circuses, and hopes such circuses will be eliminated under their rule. The system of animal protection will be radically reformed towards greater humaneness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. Regional laws on animal euthanasia, described as "cruel tenderness," should be cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:38:00">[32:38:00]</a>.
*   **Economic Conditions**: Nationalized enterprises, especially strategically important energy assets, may be redistributed among those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58:00">[13:58:00]</a>. Mandatory labeling of goods, ostensibly for quality control, was created to enrich specific lobbyists and will be addressed by the new government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:03:00">[28:03:00]</a>.
*   **Social Payments**: The speaker's team plans to significantly raise all social payments, stating that financial and economic opportunities exist for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:39:00">[36:39:00]</a>.
*   **Real Estate Prices**: The team has a plan to decrease real estate prices, which can be expected during a short-term period of chaos following a change of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:08:00">[26:08:00]</a>.
*   **Personnel and Resources**: While a shortage of trained personnel has always been a problem in Russia, and politics is expensive, the speaker believes there are enough resources generally to achieve their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:56:00">[19:56:00]</a>. Some tasks can be solved in the short or medium term, while others require 10-12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:00">[20:25:00]</a>.
*   **Propaganda**: For children, the only way to protect them from propaganda is through home-based political socialization and open conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:41:00">[17:41:00]</a>.
*   **Lustration**: The speaker is unsure if it's possible to "illustrate" the entire pedagogical corps involved in election fraud, but those who persist in delusions will be punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:09:00">[25:09:00]</a>.
*   **Crisis**: The speaker believes Russia has not moved from a stage of crisis to catastrophe and that the crisis will not be allowed to reach that point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:11:00">[31:11:00]</a>.

## External Relations and Geopolitics
*   **Far East**: The future of the Far East will critically depend on the nature of the new government, ideally one that protects Russia's national interests and territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.
*   **Finland**: The borders with Finland will eventually open, hopefully sooner rather than later, but difficult months are expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>.
*   **Belarus**: Travel from Russia to Belarus should be safe unless Belarus becomes a springboard for military or hybrid operations against Baltic countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:10:00">[21:10:00]</a>.
*   **Baltic Countries**: A hybrid operation in the Baltic countries is primarily aimed at Latvia and Estonia, with the military component being the final part of the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:00">[23:17:00]</a>.
*   **China**: Russia's economic dependence on China is partly due to Putin's "useless and suicidal" policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:53:00">[38:53:00]</a>. Putin reportedly envied China's economic growth and tried to undermine it (e.g., COVID epidemic as an attempt to punish China) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:12:00">[39:12:00]</a>. He was forced to apologize to the Chinese leadership in a humiliating manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:34:00">[39:34:00]</a>. Territories promised to China for rent were allegedly effectively transferred as new territories, a price for China's continued support for Russia and to avoid formal compensation demands for COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:46:00">[39:46:00]</a>.
*   **United States Hegemony**: The speaker contends that US hegemony no longer exists globally. While the US has strong or predominant influence in certain issues and over allies, the level of hegemony seen in the 1990s or early 2000s is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:32:00">[28:32:00]</a>.

## The Speaker's Team (Third Coalition)
The speaker identifies himself as a public figure representing a "third coalition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>.
*   **Goals**: The goals of this group in domestic and foreign policy are described as "noble and worthy," focused on the development of Russian society, ensuring Russia's security, and protecting national interests exclusively through peaceful and civilized means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>.
*   **Future**: The current [[internal political situation in Russia]] is developing in a predicted and favorable direction, even somewhat faster than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>. The team believes it is impossible for the current system to exist longer than expected, as "it has exhausted its internal margin of safety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:59:00">[21:59:00]</a>.
*   **Support**: The speaker encourages supporting their efforts through subscribing to Telegram channels and providing financial assistance (with safe options) to facilitate the "reorganization" and "liberation" of Russia on fundamentally new grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:30:00">[42:30:00]</a>.

## Other Mentions
*   **Suvalkai Corridor**: This is mentioned in the context of a hybrid operation in the Baltic countries, with its military component being the final part of the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>.
*   **Duma**: The Duma is considered a "weak-willed and pathetic appendage of the executive power," essentially a department of the presidential administration, with no independent will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:40:00">[34:40:00]</a>.
*   **Regional Secession**: The speaker has not heard of any influential forces in any Russian region wishing to secede from Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:00">[22:25:00]</a>.
*   **Forecasting**: The year 2024 was predicted to be "the most difficult and even terrible year in the last 20 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:48:00">[23:48:00]</a>. The speaker also mentioned that 2019 was the "last calm year in Russia" before the pandemic and subsequent events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:10:00">[24:10:00]</a>.
*   **Air Travel**: Flying on planes is considered safe in Russia, though there's a risk of planes not taking off for technical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:04:00">[27:04:00]</a>.

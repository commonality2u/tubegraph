On April 14th, a discussion was held regarding the recent telephone conversation between US President Joe Biden and Russian President [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Vladimir Putin]], and its wider implications for [[historical_and_current_political_implications_in_russia | Russian-Ukrainian relations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Postponement of War Prospects
The conversation between Biden and [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Putin]] temporarily "pushed aside" the immediate prospect of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. However, this does not mean the preparation of military scenarios has ceased. It is an "unambiguous preparation" of potential actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This preparation for escalation is still ongoing, with Russia's leadership currently reviewing Biden's proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Perceived Outcomes of the Call
From the Russian perspective, [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Putin]] did not achieve a substantive "win" from the call, beyond "moral satisfaction of propaganda" for state channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. For example, the issue of water supply to Crimea was not resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

The US administration's move to initiate the call was described as a "very good move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. It allowed Biden to "extend his hand" for talks while maintaining the option to apply pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Conditions for Future Meetings
The Russian leadership is currently demanding specific details from the US, including concrete deadlines and the agenda for any agreed-upon meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. A formal meeting is expected to take place only after preliminary agreements have been reached on specific issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Russia is pushing for such a meeting to occur no later than the end of May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Underlying Reasons for Russian Actions
Several factors are believed to be driving [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Putin]]'s actions:
*   **Water supply to Crimea:** The severe and worsening water crisis in Crimea threatens not only the tourist season but also risks a humanitarian catastrophe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Domestic political success:** A lack of successes on the domestic political front necessitates external political achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Multifaceted problem-solving:** [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Putin]] prefers to address "several issues at once in one fell swoop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Coercion:** The troop deployment is viewed as a form of "coercion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Awareness of [[health_rumors_about_the_russian_president_and_political_implications | Putin's Health]]
US intelligence agencies, and by extension President Biden, are fully aware of the state of [[health_rumors_about_the_russian_president and political_implications | Putin's health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This knowledge suggests that a physical meeting with [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Putin]] might be difficult or impossible in six months to a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This awareness influences the American approach, with Biden attempting to "delay time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a> while [[president_putins_actions_and_intentions | Putin]] is "in a hurry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>. Other European governments, including the British, are also reportedly aware of [[health_rumors_about_the_russian_president_and_political_implications | Putin's health]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>.

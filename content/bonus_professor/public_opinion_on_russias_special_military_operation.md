Closed surveys indicate varied public sentiment within Russia regarding the special military operation (SMO). While official narratives often promote widespread support, underlying data reveals more complex views, particularly among different demographics and media consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

## Overall Sentiment

Approximately one-third of Russians, slightly less than 30%, believe the special operation should be stopped immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This suggests a significant portion of the population does not align with the ongoing military actions.

## Age-Based Differences

Opinion on the special military operation varies considerably by age group:
*   **Youth (18-24 years old):** A majority of 56% are in favor of stopping the operation, while only 19% support its continuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. This demographic includes potential conscripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Young Adults (25-34 years old):** Support for continuing the operation is at 43%, with 41% advocating for its cessation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   **Seniors (Over 60 years old):** The overwhelming majority, 72%, insist on continuing the "denazification" of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. This group is generally not threatened by [[russian_mobilization_and_military_actions | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

## Media Consumption and Opinion

The primary source of information significantly influences public opinion:
*   **Internet Users:** Among those who primarily use the internet for news, 47% are in favor of stopping the special operation, compared to 35% who support continuing hostilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   **Television Viewers:** For individuals whose main news source is television, the sentiment is "exactly the opposite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

## Government Response to Public Opinion

The Kremlin acknowledges the lack of widespread public support for the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. To counter this, the Russian state is increasingly relying on repressive policies to ensure "apparent support" for the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
*   **New Laws:** Amendments to the criminal code, signed by the President, introduce severe penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>:
    *   Public calls to action against Russia's security: up to 7 years in prison and a fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
    *   Repeated propaganda or public demonstration of Nazi symbols or extremist organizations (including Facebook and Instagram logos, which are recognized as extremist in Russia): up to 4 years in prison or a fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
    *   Confidential cooperation with foreign countries: 2 to 8 years in prison with a fine of up to one million rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

These legislative amendments are seen as a "barrier" to dissent, reflecting a lack of confidence in mass nationwide support for the special military operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.

## Elite and Presidential Views

Hesitations from the President of the Russian Federation reflect not only the perceived lack of success in the special military operation but also the mood within the ruling elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Two main viewpoints have emerged among the elite regarding the [[goals_and_implications_of_russias_special_military_operation | goals and implications of Russia's special military operation]]:
*   **Majority View (including military):** The majority believes Russia should be content with current territorial acquisitions and seek negotiations or a truce with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This moderate majority is persistent but not as influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Radical Minority View:** This influential minority argues that Russia must pursue a "victorious end," involving the capture of cities like Kharkiv, Dnipro, and the entire Black Sea coast (including Mykolaiv and Odesa regions), potentially even taking control of Moldova <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. However, this option is deemed unlikely to be implemented from a military standpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

The President's current hesitations are attributed to the conflicting views of these groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Despite the internal debates and [[public_opinion_on_peace_negotiations_and_mobilization_in_russia | public opinion on peace negotiations and mobilization in Russia]], the Kremlin is preparing for a long confrontation with the West, adopting an "isolationist" strategy aimed at "technological sovereignty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This approach mirrors countries like North Korea and Iran, which have achieved similar "sovereignty" but at the technological level of the USSR in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

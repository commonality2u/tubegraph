This article explores various perspectives on the legitimacy of recent Russian elections and the broader [[russian_political_situation_and_governance_issues | political situation]] within Russia, drawing on discussions regarding presidential authority, alleged falsification, and the role of public perception.

## Presidential Legitimacy and Allegations of Doubles

The legitimacy of Russia's leadership, particularly the president, is a central point of discussion. The speaker claims that the current president of Ukraine, Mr. Zelensky, has frequently spoken about the illegitimacy of the Russian presidency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This assertion, based on an analysis of the Russian presidential elections, is considered to have valid grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

A core argument raised is that Vladimir Putin has been deceased since at least October 26 of last year, and a double has replaced him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Consequently, the elections were purportedly won by this double, making the entire process illegal by definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The speaker suggests these events should be referred to as an "approval procedure" rather than an election due to their initial illegality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Furthermore, it's alleged that even with the presumed illegality, the "double" did not secure more than 50% of the votes according to Hamburg, and all reported numbers are considered to be "nothing more than lies and falsification" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### The "Putin Double" Narrative

The theory of a Putin double is central to the speaker's argument regarding the illegitimacy of the presidency. The speaker indicates that Ukraine's intelligence chief, Budanov, previously discussed Putin's doubles, though this topic is no longer raised by Ukrainian officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>. The speaker acknowledges that the Ukrainian top leadership is aware of this information, but how they utilize it is their decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

A related point addresses the question of why military actions continue if the "real Putin" who started the conflict is no longer alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. The current ruling group is said to be interested in continuing military actions to prolong and strengthen their own power on favorable terms, not necessarily in peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:31">[00:15:31]</a>.

The speaker also refutes the idea that recent appointments of alleged Putin relatives to government positions (e.g., the Ministry of Defense) indicate he is alive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. Historically, the "real" Vladimir Putin never appointed relatives to government roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>. These actions are interpreted as a "smokescreen" designed to suggest Putin is alive and making these appointments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:06">[00:42:06]</a>.

## Public Perception and Propaganda

The speaker touches upon the challenges of instilling "true truth" in what is described as a "zombified part of the [[russian_societal_concerns_and_priorities | Russian population]]" that is influenced by anti-Ukraine propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Overcoming this requires the state propaganda machine to be "switched off" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. If this happens, a significant portion of society (though not all) is expected to "come to its senses" within a relatively short period, up to six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The objective is to change the country's climate from "malignant to benign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

The speaker also notes that many people do not want to actively engage with or acknowledge [[internal_political_issues_and_public_perception_in_russia | political changes]] because they are "very tired" and prefer to rely on ready-made formulas provided by propaganda as an "energy-saving" process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:27">[00:32:27]</a>. Even significant events or "grandiose things" occurring in Russia (like Ministry of Defense purges) may not sway a considerable group of people who will remain oblivious, illustrating a "cognitive error" where people struggle to imagine a future different from the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.

## Future Implications and Reforms

The speaker suggests that the current regime is seen by its own supporters as having "outlived its usefulness," leading to fierce, politically active discussions on how to transition to a "new quality" of governance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. A crisis, particularly one with a chance of success, typically begins with conflict among the elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

If the speaker's team were to come to power, several significant reforms are envisioned:
*   **Government Documents:** Documents like passports would change with the establishment of a "new Russian republic," though this is not an immediate priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.
*   **Internet Resources:** Laws concerning the blocking of internet resources would be "virtually automatically" repealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.
*   **Political Parties:** There is a need to return to older, more decent election laws (pre-2003) and form full-fledged political parties, rather than the current "appendages of the presidential administration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>. Limiting the maximum number of mandates for a party is considered unfair to successful parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.
*   **Judicial System:** Current judicial decisions are seen as demonstrating a "common cognitive error" among officials who fail to foresee their "deplorable" future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.
*   **Pension Reform:** Pensions would be significantly increased, as Russia possesses the financial capacity within its budget <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. However, the idea of uniform pensions for all professions is rejected, as pensions should be "to each according to his labor" based on differing contributions and qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.
*   **Housing and Utilities:** The housing and communal services sector would undergo thorough and radical reform, focusing on complete transparency of financial resource allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.
*   **Financial System:** Mortgage restructuring is considered necessary due to high rates deemed "real robbery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Freezing of deposits is not currently considered due to opposition within the Russian elite, despite it being discussed as a potential way to reduce money circulation to combat deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.
*   **Film Industry:** The film industry, along with nearly every other sector, would require reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.

The speaker expects an economic crisis by the end of this year and beginning of next, which will contribute to a deepening [[potential_political_crisis_in_russia | political crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:20">[00:38:20]</a>. If power were to shift to their team, noticeable improvements could be seen almost immediately, with full recovery from the crisis and sustainable development taking up to one and a half to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:07">[00:39:07]</a>.# Russian Elections and Legitimacy Concerns

The legitimacy of leadership in Ukraine and Belarus is a subject of significant international discussion and contention, particularly in relation to the respective positions taken by Russia and the West.

## Allegations of Illegitimacy

During a meeting between the individual identified as a [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]] double and [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Alexander Grigorievich Lukashenko]] in Belarus, a central topic was the alleged illegitimacy of Ukrainian President Zelensky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. The speaker in the transcript questions the credibility of such claims, noting that [[political_situation_in_belarus_and_the_fate_of_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] is considered by some to be a "usurper power of Belarus" who lost the 2020 elections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:52">[09:49:52]</a>. Furthermore, the Russian elections held in 2024 are described as "an exceptional profanation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>, with the "Putin" figure referred to as a "usurper" and "puppet" manipulated by Nikolai Patrushev and members of Politburo 2.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:09">[10:09:09]</a>.

### Ukraine's Electoral Context

It is argued that Ukraine, currently engaged in a "war for survival" and self-preservation, is not obligated to hold elections during military operations, a stance supported by numerous historical precedents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. The Russian side's claim of Zelensky's illegitimacy is viewed as an attempt to "compromise and disavow Zelensky" and undermine the upcoming Switzerland conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>, which is intended to discuss parts of Zelensky's peace plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

### Viktor Yanukovych and Russian Allegations

To bolster their claims against Zelensky, Viktor Yanukovych was reportedly "forced to fly to Minsk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. The intention behind this was to present Yanukovych as a "legitimate candidate" capable of leading the "liberated lands of Ukraine" and establishing a "legitimate legal Ukrainian government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

However, the speaker highlights that Yanukovych "urgently left Ukraine in the train of Russian troops" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>. The individual who facilitated Yanukovych's departure later became a Hero of Russia and was reportedly involved in the Salisbury case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. The entire argument surrounding Yanukovych's legitimacy is dismissed as "absolute fiction" and a "desire to put a good face on an extremely bad game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.

## Lukashenko's Dominance and Putin Double

During the meeting in Belarus, [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] appeared to "dominate and... mocked his Vis-a-vis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. The speaker notes that the "Putin" figure, identified as a double named Evgenia Vasilyevich from Mogilev, is physically taller than the deceased original Putin by 5-7 cm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] reportedly "trolled the double" by welcoming him to "native Belarusian land," implying knowledge of the double's origins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.

From: [[bonus_professor]] <br/> 

A new historical era is beginning in Russia, marking the end of the Putin era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.

## Potential Leadership and Power Dynamics

The new government's policy, specifically regarding the North Caucasus and Chechnya, is characterized by a tightening of relations by [[russian_political_system_and_leadership | Nikolai Patrushev]] and his supporting group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Many observers believe this suggests the potential for a conflict situation or an open conflict with Chechen leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

[[political_dynamics_and_potential_leadership_change_in_russia | Nikolai Patrushev]] is described as the "supreme ruler of Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. A scenario involving the transfer of power through Putin's double, "Vasilich," to Patrushev's son, [[potential_political_changes_and_future_leadership_in_russia | Dmitry Patrushev]], is being "intensively discussed and pushed" by [[russian_political_system_and_leadership | Nikolai Patrushev]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. However, Vasilich himself is said to be wary of this plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Potential Future President

While a parliamentary republic will not be established in Russia, at least not for the transitional period, the speaker has a preferred candidate for future president but declines to name them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.

The essential qualities for a [[future_political_leadership_in_russia | future president]] are:
*   Love for the Motherland and its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>
*   Common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>

Regarding [[potential_political_changes_and_future_leadership_in_russia | Dmitry Patrushev]]:
*   He is young and belongs to a new generation accustomed to luxury and enjoying life under the shadow of influential parents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.
*   His managerial qualities are unknown, though he is described as "not evil," which is considered a significant advantage for the modern Russian elite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.
*   Doubts exist about his ability to become an effective manager of Russia, as it would require destroying the foundations of the Putin system rather than merely changing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

The speaker believes the probability of a politician like Willy Brandt emerging in Russia's post-Putin state is very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.

## Governance Structure and Transitional Period

It is believed that Russia will not establish a parliamentary republic in the immediate future, at least not for a transitional period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Instead, it will be necessary to introduce transitional norms into a new constitution. A referendum on shifting to a parliamentary system or remaining a presidential republic might be held after 10 to 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.

## Key Challenges and Considerations

### Dagestan and North Caucasus
Dagestan is an ethnically complex, multi-component region with an "incessant struggle for resources," including power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The Federal Center is forced to appoint a "Varangian" (an outsider) to remain neutral among the various ethnic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This decision, though not democratic, is considered the only possible one in the current situation for Dagestan and the [[future_challenges_in_russia | Russian Federation as a whole]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

The influence of Ramzan Kadyrov in the North Caucasus is significant and is unlikely to be inferior to the federal center's influence, causing "strong irritation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Political Transition and Stability
*   Almost "everything is possible" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
*   The likelihood of Kadyrov's march on Moscow leading to civil war and Russia's collapse is considered insignificant but not rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
*   Alexei Navalny's release is expected only when the [[future_political_changes_in_russia | political situation in Russia]] begins to change radically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. [[political_dynamics_and_potential_leadership_change_in_russia | Patrushev's government]] will not release Navalny, as Patrushev is largely behind his persecution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
*   The speaker's team has "Plan B" and "Plan C," indicating multiple strategies for the [[future_governance_and_geopolitical_strategies_of_russia | fate of Russia]]. They do not primarily rely on public action, considering it an auxiliary option, though an "Vanguard in society ready to act" exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:33">[00:21:33]</a>.

### Economic and Social Changes
*   A denomination of currency is planned, meaning a total replacement of banknotes, likely in the fall of next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.
*   Significant changes in the financial and monetary spheres are expected as a side effect of a crisis that will engulf the [[future_challenges_in_russia | Russian Federation]], starting with a crisis of the Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:10">[00:28:10]</a>.
*   The issue of affordable dentistry, currently an "unattainable dream" for many, will be addressed within the framework of healthcare system reform, likely through compensation for pensioners and low-income groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.
*   The current practice of closing shopping centers and opening drone manufacturing plants is not permanent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   There will be published lists of informers and provocateurs who collaborated with the current regime, including those from the 1930s and modern times, to ensure such actions "never happen again" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

### Geopolitical Stance
*   Reparations to Ukraine are considered a consequence of capitulation, and it's deemed impossible for Russia to capitulate in military actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. However, voluntary compensation is seen as "natural and necessary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   Lavrov's imperial statements regarding the South Caucasus are described as "inertial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:56">[00:25:56]</a>. Russia's ability to prevent countries like Armenia from leaving the CSTO or influencing Georgia is limited, partly due to Georgia serving as an important re-export channel to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

## Current State and Outlook
The speaker claims to "know for sure" that Putin is not alive, and that this will become clear "with time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The political and historical state of Russia is "beginning to end," with a shift towards a new era, though it may not yet be noticeable to the majority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. A political crisis is anticipated, beginning with a crisis of the Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>. The speaker urges people to be prepared for the "stormy birth" of this new era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

The speaker expresses confidence that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>, and that the ultimate goals are "freedom and justice for Russia, law for all, and justice for everyone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>.

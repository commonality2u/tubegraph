The potential impact of Western sanctions on Russia is a recurring topic of discussion, particularly concerning their effectiveness and the Kremlin's response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:18">[00:24:18]</a>.

## Kremlin's Perspective on Sanctions

The Kremlin believes that Europe is not capable of imposing sanctions against Russia, or more precisely against the Kremlin, that would genuinely threaten them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:21">[00:24:21]</a>. Their primary concern, almost exclusively, is with the [[impact_of_sanctions_on_russia | United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.

### Limited Effectiveness of Individual Sanctions
It is assessed that individual sanctions alone are unlikely to alter Russia's overall situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. The new Biden administration, even before officially taking office, had already prepared several versions of sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. There is a high determination to "teach a lesson to Russia," though efforts are made to differentiate between the Kremlin (Putin) and Russia as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.

### Putin's Primary Fear
[[impact_of_putins_policies_on_russias_economy | Vladimir Putin]] himself is not afraid of personal sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>. His main concern is that [[sanctions_against_russian_oligarchs | sanctions against his inner circle]] could incite them to a plot or stimulate disloyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:52">[00:25:52]</a>.

## Western Strategy and Internal Crisis
Western nations, particularly the [[impact_of_sanctions_on_russia | United States]], understand that they cannot single-handedly provoke a large-scale crisis in the Russian Federation sufficient to change the country's fate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>. They recognize that a crisis in Russia must have internal causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>. If they observe an internal crisis that is serious enough to lead to a change in power, this might stimulate their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>.

Western powers do not believe that a democrat will come to power in Russia, considering it impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>. However, they would prefer a predictable, realistic, and understandable leader who would not constantly challenge the West and would focus on [[impact_of_putins_policies_on_russias_economy | Russia's internal problems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:15">[00:52:15]</a>. Their primary concern is their own security, not [[economic_and_social_consequences_in_russia | Russia's freedom or prosperity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>. However, focusing on internal development aligns with some mutual interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>.

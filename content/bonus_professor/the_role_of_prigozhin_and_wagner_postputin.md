Questions have been raised regarding the future role of [[potential_return_of_prigozhin_and_speculation_on_putins_death | Yevgeny Prigozhin]] and the Wagner Group in Russia following the anticipated [[political_changes_and_power_dynamics_in_postputin_russia | death of Putin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Predictions suggest that significant events will unfold "very soon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, marking a period of profound change for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

## [[yevgeny_prigozhins_return_to_russia | Prigozhin's Return and Status]]

Contrary to widespread belief, [[yevgeny_prigozhins_return_to_russia | Yevgeny Prigozhin]] is reportedly "alive and well," currently at large in Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Both American intelligence agencies and the FBI are aware of his status, with the FBI's arrest warrant still active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

There are intentions for [[potential_return_of_prigozhin_and_speculation_on_putins_death | Prigozhin]] to "show up soon" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, specifically after [[political_changes_and_power_dynamics_in_postputin_russia | Putin's death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. However, the exact timing is contingent on circumstances beyond his control, influenced by his numerous "influential enemies in Russia" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Upon his return, [[potential_return_of_prigozhin_and_speculation_on_putins_death | Prigozhin]] intends to reveal "a lot of interesting things," particularly concerning the [[role_and_influence_of_putins_doubles | doubles of the Russian president]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

## Wagner's Future and Prigozhin's Influence

Initially, it was predicted that [[potential_return_of_prigozhin_and_speculation_on_putins_death | Prigozhin]] would re-emerge as a political force after [[political_changes_and_power_dynamics_in_postputin_russia | Putin's death]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. Doubts have arisen due to the perceived destruction of Wagner's "backbone" and the disappointment felt by many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

Despite this, it is suggested that [[potential_return_of_prigozhin_and_speculation_on_putins_death | Prigozhin]] will "most likely become part of some Alliance," indicating a broader coalition rather than acting independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This aligns with his historical approach, as he "did not speak on his own" even during the events of June 24 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The question of who will follow him remains "open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Post-Putin Political Landscape

The period after [[political_changes_and_power_dynamics_in_postputin_russia | Putin's death]] is expected to be characterized by "chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, although efforts will be made to ensure it is "short-term" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Information regarding [[political_changes_and_power_dynamics_in_postputin_russia | Putin's death]] and the existence of [[role_and_influence_of_putins_doubles | doubles]] will eventually be made public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This revelation is expected to cause "dumbfounded amazement and disgust" among the populace upon realizing the extent of deception and theft that has occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. It is estimated that 4 trillion US dollars have been withdrawn from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

The West, along with China, is reportedly "ready to deal with a double" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>. They prioritize maintaining the status quo and political stability, even under a dictatorship, as long as control over the nuclear arsenal is preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. China's interest lies in Russia's continued economic dependence as a raw material provider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. This stance by foreign powers is deemed "absolutely hypocritical and two-faced" for Russian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

A "very, very likely" paid online event on October 26 at 20:00 Moscow time, titled "After Putin," will discuss how the "post-Putin reality will be formed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:18">[00:19:18]</a>. This event aims to explore the roles of various intermediary and elite groups in the "division of Putin's legacy and the succession of power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

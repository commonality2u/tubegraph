The World Health Organization (WHO) has faced growing criticism from various perspectives regarding its handling of the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:36">[04:34:36]</a>. This criticism comes from both the political right and left, and from civil society organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:42">[04:40:42]</a>.

## Allegations of Mismanagement and Corruption

The WHO is described as a "typical international bureaucratic organization that exists to reproduce itself and to receive profit from various kinds of dubious companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:47">[06:20:47]</a>. A primary critique is its alleged failure in early warning for the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:50">[06:55:50]</a>. It is strongly suspected that the organization was "corrupted by the Chinese government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:01">[07:04:01]</a>.

This situation is likened to the FIFA scandal, where hosting rights for the World Cup were granted for a significant reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:07">[07:09:07]</a>. The WHO's actions are seen as part of a "camouflage that the Chinese put up against the world community to hide the epidemic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:13">[07:36:13]</a>. It is argued that "the death of tens of thousands of people" falls on the conscience of WHO functionaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:09">[07:50:09]</a>. Losing only part of their funding is considered insufficient punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:52">[07:55:52]</a>. The United States is expected to "initiate corruption investigations" related to WHO's activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:23">[08:00:23]</a>.

## Historical Context and Inconsistency

Critics point to "strange inconsistency" in WHO's response compared to past pandemics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:42">[05:23:42]</a>:
*   **Hong Kong Flu (1968-1969):** An epidemic of the "banking flu" led to "one million people died" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:07">[05:31:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:37">[05:37:37]</a>. Despite this, there was no announcement of a pandemic or quarantine situation by WHO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:31">[05:25:31]</a>.
*   **Asian Flu (1958):** This pandemic "took the lives of two million people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:47">[05:48:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:24">[05:51:24]</a>.
*   **Swine Flu H1N1:** More recently, this strain had a "proven mortality [rate of] 17-18 percent," resulting in "200 thousand people" dying, mainly in North America and Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:32">[05:53:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

These historical events, with higher mortality rates, did not trigger the same level of global quarantine and pandemic declarations, leading to questions about the current response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

Donald Trump notably "stopped funding" the WHO, wishing to blame the organization for problems in the American economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:31">[04:42:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:10">[04:49:10]</a>. This position is considered "absolutely correct" by some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:47">[07:23:47]</a>.

Ultimately, the argument is that this type of [[role_of_nonpublic_organizations_in_global_politics | nonpublic organization]] "did nothing for early warning" and was likely "corrupted by the Chinese government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:50">[06:55:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:01">[07:04:01]</a>.

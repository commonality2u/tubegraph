## Political Crisis and Power Dynamics
It is impossible to predict the full development, content, and results of a political crisis. No existing theory allows this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While the beginning of a political crisis can be predicted with over 75% accuracy, approaching the accuracy of a short-term weather forecast (85%), its course and end results cannot be foreseen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. However, active participation from the crisis's onset offers tangible chances to influence outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The most acute phase, or peak, of the crisis is expected to last only a few days, while the crisis itself will span several months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

In the ongoing power struggle, those opposing Nikolai Platonovich Patrushev and his allies are equally influential, making opposition to them difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Loyalty among allies fighting for power is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The pursuit of power in Russia can blind individuals, overriding rational and logical considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. The strength of coalitions, such as those of Patrushev and Chemezov, is described as equal, with Chemezov's coalition possibly even stronger currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

### Role of State Agencies in a Crisis
In an upcoming crisis, the Prosecutor General's Office and the Investigative Committee are expected to align with the winning side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. In the acute phase, these bodies may not play a direct role as they lack armed resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. However, they can serve as important instruments in the hands of one of the competing coalitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) will likely subordinate itself to the winners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. A preferable position for the MVD leadership might be neutrality, akin to a "fortress plan" where police stations close themselves off and do nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This behavior is compared to the KGB of the USSR in August 1991, which also adopted a "fortress plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The Ministry of Defense is also expected to take a position of neutrality and play no role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. However, within the General Staff, the main department (GRU) could play an important role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### Conflict and Stability in Russia
The ongoing elite war is not expected to escalate into a civil war or lead to the collapse of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>. While armed excesses are probable, they will likely be brief and localized, primarily in the center of the Russian capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:22">[00:36:22]</a>. A large-scale civil war covering significant parts of Russia will not occur due to a lack of necessary conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. There is a risk of a split or withdrawal of some territories, with the North Caucasus identified as a dangerous zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>.

## [[military_and_political_dynamics_between_russia_and_ukraine | Military and Political Dynamics Between Russia and Ukraine]]
### Kharkov
The Russian Federation desires to take possession of Kharkov but currently lacks the military strength for such an operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. It is unlikely that such forces will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. The political leadership views taking Kharkov as a powerful incentive for Ukraine to negotiate on Russia's terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. However, the military understands they are not able to carry out this operation with current resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. The Ukrainian front may collapse due to the "fog of war" and unforeseen developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. The role of chance in military actions is significant and cannot be discounted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

### Peace Negotiations and War Crimes
Peaceful negotiations between Ukraine and [[russia_nato_tensions_and_geopolitical_shifts | Russia]] are possible both before and after a coup in Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. The speaker's political force actively participates in efforts to stop the "fraternal killings" in Ukraine, though specific details are not revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

Regarding war crimes, the political force holds a "definitely positive" stance on investigating and punishing war criminals after the war's conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. All individuals guilty of crimes against humanity and war crimes must be identified, found, and brought to justice, regardless of which side they fought on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

### Crimea
Crimea is not expected to fare well regardless of how the situation develops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

## Regional Geopolitical Concerns
### [[military_and_nuclear_concerns_regarding_ukraine_and_russia | Nuclear War Possibility]]
The possibility of a nuclear war is theoretically not excluded, but practically, despite saber-rattling and rhetoric, the real chance of such a conflict starting is fortunately very small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

### Kaliningrad and Baltic Countries
If the Russian Federation does not initiate a hybrid operation against the Baltic countries, as the Kremlin reportedly plans, then the Kaliningrad region will be fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>. If such an operation begins, the outcome will heavily depend on its dynamics and NATO's reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. A preliminary hybrid operation targeting Latvia and Estonia in particular is scheduled for the summer-fall of this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. The plan for this operation has been developed and is quite structured, and judging by European media reports referencing intelligence, it has "non-zero chances of success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

### Siberia and Far East
There is a hypothetical possibility of Siberia and the Far East territories falling under China's protectorate, but this possibility is expected to trend towards zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. Much will depend on the future leadership of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>.

### [[geopolitical_dynamics_involving_china_and_russia | Geopolitical Dynamics Involving China and Russia]] (Georgia and Armenia)
Regarding Georgia, the Kremlin has successfully implemented its plans, and the Georgian leadership is under "very strong influence" of the Kremlin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. The adoption of the law on "Foreign Agents," copied from Russian law, is cited as proof <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. However, the Kremlin is unable to influence Georgian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

For Armenia, the Kremlin wishes to "punish" the country due to Nikol Pashinyan's leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a>. However, the Kremlin's resources are diverted to other fronts, making it unable to act on this desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:51]</a>.

## Internal Security and Societal Issues
### Weapons Legislation
The regular tightening of weapons legislation in Russia, including the ability for the Ministry of Internal Affairs or FSB to refuse or cancel licenses based on unseen conclusions, stems from the authorities' fear of the people, especially armed people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>. The speaker believes that sooner or later, Russia will need to allow the right to bear arms, though not immediately after military actions due to potential societal mental instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>.

### Data Leaks
The problem of massive personal data leaks at the level of government agencies is acknowledged, with individuals within these agencies reportedly interested in and protecting this business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:56">[00:34:56]</a>. The speaker believes it would be "quite easy" to stop such massive leaks and punish those responsible within three to six months if a new government has the desire to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:11">[00:35:11]</a>.

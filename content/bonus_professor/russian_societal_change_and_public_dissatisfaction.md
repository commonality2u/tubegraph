Russia is currently undergoing a significant transition, characterized by a feeling that the world is collapsing and an old order is falling away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This transition, which began in the 1990s with the collapse of the Soviet model of socialism, is occurring without significant overt conflict or a large-scale "earthquake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic merely highlighted this ongoing transition rather than initiating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Societal Transformation

The ongoing changes are complex and multifaceted, including:
*   **Technological Revolution and Simplification** The technological revolution is leading to a simplification and unification of human nature, contributing to a decrease in overall intelligence levels. There's a noticeable decline in interest in the vast culture developed by European and global civilizations by the end of the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Education and Segregation** Universities, once seen as tools against social discrimination, are now becoming instruments of segregation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Elite institutions may serve as "new monasteries" preserving "sacred knowledge," while the general student population struggles with reading large texts due to shortened attention spans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Freedom and Illusion** The future world is predicted to have numerous restrictions, but people may not perceive these limitations if they lack the initial understanding or the will to seek knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Many live in a "huge illusion" or "simulacra," lacking the desire to break through these perceived realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Loss of Meaning** Contemporary civilization feels like living on the ruins of ancient Rome, where buildings and knowledge exist, but their meaning has been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This new world is largely one of "slaves" who do not understand their condition, while a dominant financial elite maintains its status quo through closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## Elite Dynamics and Occultism

A significant aspect of current [[russian_sociopolitical_dynamics | Russian sociopolitical dynamics]] involves the power struggles within the ruling elite, who are fighting fiercely for the succession of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. Key figures involved include Kovalchuk, Timchenko, Igor Ivanovich, Patrushev, Medvedev, and Shoigu, with Sobyanin recently finding new allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:42">[00:22:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>.

These power struggles are not only characterized by typical intrigues but also by a reliance on occult means. Some individuals within the elite consult Siberian shamans, while others invite shamans from Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>. The settlement of major political events is reportedly accompanied by "sky and shamanic journeys" and visionary types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. Different departments reportedly prefer different occult styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>.

There is a growing demand for black magic, which involves the shedding of blood and rituals such as the sacrifice of black roosters and goats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. This trend, which began to sharply increase around 2014, reflects the elite's feeling that the situation is changing and the status quo is radically shifting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. They are seeking any available tools, including magic, occultism, and a primitive form of Orthodoxy, to preserve their assets and positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>. However, they reportedly struggle to find true "masters" who can provide genuine initiation or open paths, as their primary interests remain wealth and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

The ruling elite is described as having a deep sense of insecurity about their legitimacy, leading them to search for "real rulers of this world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>. This insecurity drives them to resort to brutal repression and aggressive behavior to try and instill confidence in their own strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>. They fear change and losing control of the situation, including perceived influence from the West, which they once believed they could easily corrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:55">[00:52:55]</a>.

## Public Dissatisfaction and Potential for Change

Despite the authorities' efforts to maintain control through repression, the system's efficiency is constantly decreasing due to internal conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>. Repressive measures, which may have been effective in the 1930s, now lead to the paralysis of the state apparatus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:39">[00:32:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:44">[00:32:44]</a>.

There is a colossal demand for change in Russia, shared by over two-thirds, possibly three-quarters, of society. This level of demand was last seen around 1990-1991 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:51">[00:32:51]</a>. There is also a significant demand for freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:15">[00:33:15]</a>. While there are no clearly expressed subjects of change with a political face, the concept of a "great sleeping Russian people" is outdated; the population is now highly virtualized and fragmented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>.

However, a high level of readiness for revolt exists among the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>. Recent local protests in Khabarovsk, Bashkiria, and against landfills demonstrate this significant potential, though a "trigger" is needed to set off a broader movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:48">[00:35:48]</a>.

Potential national triggers for widespread unrest include:
*   **Economic Instability** A rapid and significant devaluation of the ruble, followed by a denomination and exchange of banknotes, could cause a very strong mass reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:39">[00:36:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.
*   **Political Transit** The beginning of the political transition process, where competing elite groups realize one is losing, could lead them to seek support from society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>. This engagement of society makes the political "game" unpredictable, like squeezing toothpaste out of a tube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.

The authorities are perceived as being at the limit of their repressive capabilities, unable to solve underlying issues like economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:53">[00:30:53]</a>. The widespread irritation and dissatisfaction with the authorities suggest a readiness for change, with many believing that "everything is ready to break through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:58">[00:38:58]</a>. This situation points to a potentially eventful end of the current year and the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.

## External Influences and the "World Government" Myth

Discussions about a "world government" are prevalent in Russia, with half the population believing in its existence, including those in power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>. This belief stems from the authorities' internal insecurity about their legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

However, non-public, influential organizations (not a world government) do exist, with about a dozen and a half such groups globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>. These groups are composed of the "cream of Western society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. They do not accept the "cream of [[sociocultural_and_political_changes_in_postputin_russia | Russian society]]" due to their perceived lack of historical responsibility and involvement in corruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. These organizations are not a world government; their goal is to maintain global balance and harmony, which they believe the Kremlin is currently disrupting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:22">[00:49:22]</a>. They believe in the principle of free will and recognize the limitations of manipulative mechanisms, understanding that the fate of a country is ultimately decided by its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:13">[00:47:13]</a>.

Despite external pressures, such as economic sanctions, the ultimate decision on societal change will come from within Russia itself, driven by the actions of its people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>. The internal conflict within the Russian elite and their perceived inability to influence international non-public organizations like the elite themselves are causing internal strife <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.

The ruling elite's current strategy involves transferring assets into physical forms (e.g., tons of dollars and gold) and storing them in inaccessible locations like Africa and Latin America, possibly due to fears of American intelligence access to digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>. This highlights their deep fear of losing their wealth and position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>.

Ultimately, the lack of meaningful historical narratives or values from the authorities, coupled with their insecurity and inability to implement effective management beyond terror, indicates a system without a clear path for development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. The future of Russia will be decided by its people and their exercise of free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>.

Ayahuasca, according to mythological concepts, is considered a gift from the gods to people [00:55:17]. Only those to whom this gift was intended are meant to use it [00:55:33]. If an individual from a tribe violates this prohibition and reveals the secret to a stranger, the gods, according to mythology, can become angry and punish the entire tribe with diseases and difficulties [00:55:42]. Additionally, individual sanctions can be imposed on the violator by the eldest of the tribe or the shaman [00:55:58].

## Authentic Ayahuasca Rituals

### Preparation and Components
An authentic "drink of the gods," ayahuasca, consists of only two components: a liana copy containing harmin and a plant containing dimethyltryptamine [00:56:39]. The preparation process for this drink takes many hours, exclusively during daylight hours [00:56:52]. The drink is then consumed after sunset [00:57:01].

### The Ritual Sequence
The authentic preparation method is used exclusively in special ceremonies, which do not happen very often [00:57:07]. The sequence of the ritual is paramount and consists of three main stages [00:58:05]. Before and after the main ceremony, dedicated participants are given entheogens, which are plant-based products influencing the human psyche [00:58:24]. The alkaloid given before the ceremony helps to reset consciousness and prepare the individual for a "fully-fledged trance" [00:58:38]. It is crucial to go through a hallucination to avoid a mix of new experiences and superimposed memories from different life periods, a practice known as "walking through the evening fog" [00:59:11]. After exiting this allegorical fog, ayahuasca is used, initiating a "full-fledged transpersonal trip" where the boundaries of space and time disappear, and a journey within oneself and into the universe begins, lasting 4-6 hours [00:59:30]. After the transpersonal trip, another entheogen is given to allow the spirit to return to its body [00:59:53]. This sequence is carefully guarded, not the recipe or components of the shamanic tea [00:57:49].

## Commoditization of Ayahuasca Rituals

### Motivation for Falsification
Despite the traditional prohibitions, money is a strong temptation that many tribes find difficult to resist [00:56:03]. As a result, many tribes resort to a "trick": instead of an authentic hallucinogen, they offer a complex decoction [00:56:16]. This decoction's hallucinogenic effect is akin to genuine ayahuasca but is not the true substance [00:56:26].

### The "Tourist" Ayahuasca Experience
The [[Occult practices in Russian politics | Russian pseudo-elite]] and middle class often travel to the Amazon in search of these experiences [00:54:11]. For example, the Bora tribe in the Colombian Amazon hosts these "pilgrims" [01:01:15]. Travelers arrive by private helicopter and boat to a "so-called ethnographic village" built specifically for such occasions [01:01:20]. The residents live elsewhere and only come to the village for these events, creating an "imitation of life" [01:02:02].

Upon arrival, pilgrims are greeted by villagers to the sounds of a ritual drum and colorful songs and dances [01:02:20]. In the evening, they drink the offered ayahuasca [01:02:46]. What they receive is a "very high quality hallucinosis," created by the brain, which often deceives [01:03:01]. They believe they are contacting spirits and receiving answers to their questions [01:02:50]. However, the crucial sequence of the authentic ritual is not performed for these "rich and curious pilgrims" [01:00:24].

### Pseudo-Shamans and Their Practices
The individuals conducting these sessions are largely "charlatans" [01:05:12]. This is a "commercial project" that many civilized Amazonian tribes monetize [01:05:22]. These [[Shamanic rituals and political influence | shamans]] can be sent anywhere, including Moscow or Toronto, and will tell clients "what they want to hear" [01:05:43]. They often rely on information gleaned through simple physiognomy or prior intelligence to tell a person what they need to hear [01:06:47]. The entire experience is a form of "psychotherapy" [01:06:21].

### Cost and Consequences
The cost for such "respectable [[Shamanic rituals and political influence | shamans]] for respectable gentlemen" starts from half a million dollars, with prices potentially reaching several million [01:07:19]. Despite the high cost, the outcome is merely a "placebo effect" and "dummy" in reality [01:04:00], [01:07:07]. It may provide a calming effect, but no actual metaphysical changes occur [01:07:13]. The "advanced" [[Occult practices in Russian politics | pseudo-elite]] may use a wide range of alkaloids for their trance states, including Colorado River toad venom, dimethyltryptamine, and lysergic acid (LSD) or psilocybin mushrooms [01:03:39].

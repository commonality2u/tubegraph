Henry Kissinger's influence on American politics and global affairs has diminished significantly in recent decades. It is argued that he did not hold significant sway in shaping American foreign policy during the last 10 to 20 years, and his role should not be overstated in modern times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

While Kissinger was influential in the 1970s and 1980s, his opinions in recent years, though still holding some significance, were considered to be from someone "out of circulation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. He did not provide any substantial influence on the development of American foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

A question was posed regarding Kissinger's role in a perceived policy of "betrayal of Ukraine by the West" and "flirting with Putin and Patrushev" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. However, the speaker indicates that Kissinger's death would not lead to changes in this regard, due to his already diminished influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

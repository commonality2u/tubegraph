## Kazakhstan's Stance on Russian Military Aid
The Russian "president," identified as a double, recently visited Kazakhstan in an unsuccessful attempt to secure increased imports and intermediary services for supplying dual-use products to the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. Kazakhstan's President Tokayev, however, politely but adamantly refused, stating that Kazakhstan had already exhausted its transit aid resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Tokayev emphasized that further strengthening import volumes to Russia would lead to serious problems for the Kazakh economy and financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. The speaker noted Tokayev's dismissive attitude toward the Russian double during the meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

### Russia's Boasting of "Miracle Weapons"
Following this refusal, the individual identified as "Yevgeny Vasilyevich" (Putin's double) responded by praising a "miracle weapon" allegedly capable of changing the [[potential_strategic_turning_points_in_the_conflict | strategic situation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. This weapon, referred to as "hazelnut" or "Sel," was claimed to threaten Europe and London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. However, the speaker described this boasting as an "impotent" attempting to "boast of his former sexual exploits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, identifying the rocket as a "phallic symbol of treason" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

In reality, the so-called "hazelnut" is not very original or new, being a recombination and modernization of Soviet-era missile weapons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. Establishing its serial production is a long and difficult process, a fact known to the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

## [[russian_military_operations_and_international_relations | Russian Military Operations]] and Resource Depletion
Recent events in Syria highlight Russia's military resource depletion. The city of Aleppo fell, with Russian specialists reportedly evaporating or disappearing and an air force base evacuated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. Syrian President Assad's request for [[military_strategy_and_developments | military assistance]] in Moscow was met with a polite but adamant refusal, as "all the weapons were thrown to the Ukrainian front" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. Equipment, planes, and military personnel were also unavailable, being redirected to the Ukrainian front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>. The speaker noted the absence of PMC Wagner forces in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>. Russia's position in the regional "game" involving Turkey and Iran is described as "not very convincing" and a sign of needing to retreat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>.

## [[Diplomatic Relations and International Cooperation | International Negotiations]] and Military Aid
The Russian Minister of Defense, Belousov, recently traveled to Pyongyang to meet with North Korean counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. This visit occurred as the new American administration had begun consultations with China and North Korea, proposing that North Korea reduce its [[military_strategy_and_developments | military aid]] to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. This diplomatic move is intended to compel Russia to enter negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>, especially since Russia heavily relies on North Korea for ammunition, shells, and missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

Conversely, the speaker noted that a potential future Trump administration in the US might reduce [[military_strategy_and_developments | military aid]] to Ukraine, aiming to bring both sides to the negotiating table <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. Belousov's trip to Pyongyang aimed to secure guarantees from North Korea to continue its critical military aid to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

### Parties' Decreasing Ability to Conduct Intensive Military Action
Both Russia and Ukraine are experiencing a progressive inability to conduct intensive military actions due to [[impact_of_resource_depletion_on_military_conflicts | resource depletion]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

### Ukraine's Shift on Territorial Claims
Ukrainian President Zelensky, in an interview, made an "unprecedented statement" indicating Ukraine's readiness to abandon a military return of lost territories in exchange for NATO membership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. Previously, Ukraine had publicly insisted on the return of all lost territories to the borders of January 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. The speaker suggests that Zelensky understands NATO is not immediately ready for Ukraine's membership, and this statement serves to prepare the Ukrainian audience for a compromise with the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.

Despite this, Russia continues to try and increase pressure to gain more territory, though not very successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>. Ukraine, while retreating, continues to inflict serious losses on Russia while publicly expressing readiness for compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>.

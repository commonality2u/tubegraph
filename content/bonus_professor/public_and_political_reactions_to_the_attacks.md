Recent events, including drone attacks on the Kremlin, have triggered significant public and political reactions within Russia, shaping an increasingly tense national atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Escalating Tensions and Attacks

Russia is moving rapidly towards the introduction of full or partial martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This shift is prompted by a series of incidents:
*   **Kremlin Drone Attack** On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, the Moscow Kremlin was reportedly attacked by drones of unknown origin, widely believed to be Ukrainian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The Kremlin's swift public acknowledgement of this attack, via its press secretary and propaganda machine, is seen as an admission that "things are not going very well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   **Symbolic Nature** The attack was primarily symbolic, as President Putin is rarely in the Kremlin, preferring deep bunkers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. One drone was reportedly shot down near the Senate building, where the state flag flies, conveying vulnerability and the idea that the Russian flag has "fallen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This symbolism is considered especially significant in Ukraine ahead of an anticipated offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Previous Incidents** The drone attack followed other incidents of a military nature:
    *   Sabotage on railway transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
    *   FSB announcements of a prevented assassination attempt on the head of the Republic of Crimea, Aksyonov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
    *   Regular drone attacks not only in frontline areas but increasingly in Moscow and the Moscow region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

## Public Reactions

The ongoing attacks and perceived threats are contributing to a [[psychological_reactions_to_mobilization_news | hysterical atmosphere]] in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Mania for Drone Detection
A widespread "mania for searching and detecting Ukrainian drones" has swept Moscow and the Moscow region since April <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. On one day, up to 100 calls were received from eyewitnesses reporting drone sightings, though the overwhelming majority were considered "absolute nonsense" and dictated by the fears of the callers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This public reaction indicates "strong nervousness" and "strong tension," rather than widespread panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## Political and Official Responses

The authorities are reacting to these events with increased security measures and discussions of martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Demands for Martial Law
Secretary of the Security Council, Patrushev, has "demanded" that the president immediately impose martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. While martial law is already in effect in the "new territories," the demand is for its extension to the Russian capital, frontline regions, and potentially other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### Putin's Stance
President Putin has postponed a decision on martial law, preferring not to make hasty decisions, likely until after the May 9 parade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. He is reportedly hesitant because introducing martial law would diminish his power in favor of the security officers who would control its implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### Preparations and Regulations
*   **Legal Amendments** Amendments to the Federal Constitutional Law on martial law were introduced on May 3 to allow elections in the "new regions" of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. However, there is no certainty that these regional elections will be held at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Airspace Monitoring** Moscow authorities have ordered public utilities to monitor the capital's airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **Drone Ban** On May 3, the Moscow mayor banned all drone launches in the city, except for authorized ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Potential Implications of Martial Law
Should martial law be formally introduced or its elements implemented without formal declaration, significant restrictions could follow:
*   **Civil Rights Restrictions** This includes restrictions on civil rights and freedoms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Travel Ban** Individuals subject to military service, a database estimated to contain over 15 million people, could face a ban on travel outside the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Movement Restrictions** Restrictions on movement between regions might be introduced, alongside strengthened passport control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Freedom of Speech** A restriction on freedom of speech is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Internment** The possibility of internment, meaning detention without trial for up to 30 days (extendable), could be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Conscription** Conscription would become much easier to carry out, with existing formal restrictions potentially ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
*   **Financial Restrictions** It is theoretically possible to block bank cards and accounts for those potentially subject to mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. The Central Bank and financial authorities are reportedly ready for this, despite their reluctance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### Enforcement and Local Authority Role
Mass checks of those subject to conscription and military service, as well as escorts to military registration and enlistment offices, are already beginning in some cities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Digitalization is being used to track individuals, as seen in an incident where police identified and approached a young man in Sberbank via video cameras for military registration purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

The scope of implemented restrictions will largely depend on the position of local authorities, who will negotiate the measures to be implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Moscow Mayor Sobyanin, for instance, is expected to try and protect Moscow citizens to maintain their loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

Valery Solovyov, on his YouTube channel's sixth episode of "Answers to Hot Questions," recorded at noon on Thursday, December 1st, discusses the current and potential future restrictions impacting Russian citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Impact of New Laws and Disclaimers

A new law, effective December 1st, has led to longer disclaimers on video content, including announcements about the speaker being an "Agent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> and content being intended for individuals over 18 years of age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Solovyov expresses concern that these disclaimers could eventually take up "several minutes" of video time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. He also notes that under the new law, he is unable to work in his specialty, becoming dependent on public support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:11">[00:30:11]</a>.

## Mobilization and its Expanding Scope

Despite presidential statements, mobilization has not been stopped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. There are indications that a second stage of mobilization could involve up to two million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. To achieve this, the criteria for conscription will likely be softened, extending mobilization to those without combat experience or who did not previously serve in the armed forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. The age limit is not expected to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. Citizens are expected to self-equip mobilized individuals, including purchasing bulletproof vests and other necessary gear, even if it means taking out loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Potential Future Restrictions

There is additional, "frightening" information regarding future restrictions, potentially coinciding with the next stage of mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. These plans include widespread martial law, possibly across large Russian cities or the entire territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. The president is allegedly informed that technical capabilities for almost complete control over the population will be ready by January-February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

Key potential restrictions include:
*   **Total Control via QR Codes** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>:
    *   **First Group (70-80% of population)**: Prohibited from leaving their subject of the Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
    *   **Second Group**: Slightly expanded travel ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
    *   **Third Group (smallest)**: Most trusted people, including security forces, allowed to move throughout the Russian Federation, but not to leave the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Exit Visas**: All citizens may be prohibited from leaving Russia, requiring a special permit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **Curfew** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
*   **Internment**: The possibility of detention for up to 30 days without trial or investigation, with a special detention center near Moscow (Sakharov) reportedly designated for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
*   **Blocking of Bank Cards**: For those in the database of potentially mobilized individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>.
*   **Censorship and Surveillance**:
    *   Checking phones for "questionable materials" (non-criminal but potentially incriminating) when traveling abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.
    *   While individual apartment checks for YouTube subscriptions are unlikely due to lack of resources, there's a possibility of YouTube being closed down entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

Despite these far-reaching plans, Solovyov expresses "serious doubts" about their full realization, predicting a rapid descent into "chaos, disorder and total disorganization" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. He believes this growing discontent might influence the leadership's decisions regarding martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.

Solovyov warns that these potential restrictions, if implemented, will only bring "bad things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. He also notes that the new law regarding "agents" significantly restricts his ability to work in his profession, effectively depriving him of certain rights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>. The situation is contributing to a [[potential_political_crisis_in_russia | political crisis]] and growing societal discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

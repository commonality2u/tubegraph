The future of Russian governance is anticipated to undergo significant transformations, moving towards a new republic and addressing various internal issues, including the declassification of sensitive documents, economic restructuring, and social reforms.

## Governance and Political Structure

### New Russian Republic
The establishment of a new Russian Republic is considered inevitable, as the previous one, formed between 1991 and 1993, has been irrevocably destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This new republic will tear away from the former legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### Presidential Role and Legitimacy
It is expected that it will be publicly announced that a double, "Vasilyevich," has long been performing the duties of the president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This revelation is predicted to be a world sensation, or even a "world shock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Western governments are believed to be fully aware of this deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. The illegitimacy of this period means that all signed agreements, decrees, and amended laws will be swept away by the coming changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The speaker's team is interested in cleansing society of the "monstrous total lie" in which it lives by telling the truth, even if it is shocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### Political Leadership and Transitions
If a coalition involving Patrushev and Manturov were to seize power, it would be "much better" than the current situation, though this is not the ultimate goal of the speaker's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. The speaker's team has almost all the necessary components to change Russia's historical trajectory and break away from a vicious cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:15">[00:37:15]</a>.

### Intelligence and Law Enforcement Reforms
Serious [[internal_political_developments_in_russia | changes]] are anticipated in all law enforcement agencies, including the Investigative Committee, by the fall of this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. These changes may involve leadership changes within departments, not necessarily at the very top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

The FSB, while recognized as a necessary organization for state interests, requires "radical" and profound [[social_and_political_reforms_necessary_for_russias_future | reform]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:25">[00:39:25]</a>.

### Declassification of Documents and Accountability
The speaker's team intends to declassify KGB and FSB documents, opening archives with the exception of top-secret units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. They plan to reveal the names of all informers who worked against Russian society, emphasizing that this information is recorded and will become available despite any promises given to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This is aimed at ensuring that evil is punished and to prevent such events from recurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Economic and Social Reforms

### Environmental Protection
The speaker's team plans to significantly raise pollution control, possibly to an absolute level, to ensure an ecologically clean environment and quality food for the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Economic Programs
Detailed economic programs and a plan for social development for Russia have been developed, with information to be made public in due course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

### Financial Assets and Denomination
The assets of the "late President Putin and his family," including tens of tons of dollars, convertible currencies, precious metals, and stones, were reportedly taken to Crimea from Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

A denomination of currency is an "inevitable stage" for exiting the financial and economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. Citizens who have followed recommendations to stock up on currency like dollars and euros are protected from the risks of losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:14">[00:28:14]</a>. Banning currency circulation is considered "almost unbelievable" and counterproductive as a black market would persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">[00:29:17]</a>.

### Social Welfare and Rights
Participants in the Baimak events and all [[future_of_russian_government_legal_reforms_and_political_prisoners | political prisoners]], as well as those formally arrested under other articles but are effectively political prisoners, will be unconditionally released and rehabilitated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

The Dima Yakovlev law, which had a "strictly negative attitude," will be repealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Those who initiated it and harmed children in orphanages are subject to fair punishment according to the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:22]</a>.

### Retirement Age
The speaker believes there is a reason to consider establishing the same retirement age for men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. The initial plan is to return to the original retirement age values, and then potentially equalize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

### Infrastructure and Transport
Reducing the cost of public transport, train, and plane tickets is a goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. This can be achieved through subsidies, particularly for air travel in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>. The primary policy should lead to a significant, gradual, and constant increase in Russian citizens' income, making tickets more affordable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:56">[00:28:56]</a>.

### Regional Development
The current situation where everything flows to Moscow is considered unhealthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:16">[00:24:16]</a>. The team plans to create new development centers in regions by stimulating them and paying attention "not in words but in deeds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>. This will begin with leaving regions a larger share of regional income, initiating "budgetary federalism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:32">[00:24:32]</a>. The ultimate goal is to transform Russia into a federation in practice, requiring people to bear responsibility for their land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:05">[00:25:05]</a>.

### Migration Policy
The current uncontrolled, chaotic, and dangerous migration to Russia for traditional way of life, identity, and national security will be addressed with a new, comprehensive migration policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:40">[00:25:40]</a>. This policy will start with the reduction of the visa regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Migrants will be directed to where they are needed, rather than where conditions are most favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.

### Deurbanization and Rural Revival
A program for the deurbanization of Russia will be launched and financed, aiming to revive villages and support people looking to resettle in rural areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>. This will be possible by not financing military actions and curbing large-scale theft, which would effectively provide a "second or even a third budget" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.

## Cultural and Historical Perspectives

### Monuments to Heroes
The speaker's team has a definite point of view on what will happen to the recently erected monuments to "heroes of their own will" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, though the specifics are not detailed.

### Lenin's Burial and Mausoleum
Lenin should be buried sooner rather than later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>. The Mausoleum, recognized as a monument of architecture, history, and culture, should not be torn down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:54">[00:26:54]</a>. Instead, it could be transformed into a museum of Russian banners, showcasing flags from different historical periods, including those before Peter the Great, Imperial Russia, the Soviet Banner, and modern Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

### Moral Responsibility and Historical Education
Society's attempt to forget the armed conflict and hush up its memory is seen as unfair, as it allows society to move away from moral responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. The true story of what happened to Russia, especially over the last quarter-century, needs to be covered and reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. This honest and impartial history, though unpleasant, should become part of school socialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

While moral responsibility is an individual category and cannot be imposed, the team aims to tell the truth, open people's eyes, and make historical and humanitarian education truthful, improving the quality of school education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>. The goal is to create a new situation and framework that allows people to honestly and frankly examine their past and present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

### Integration of Veterans
The issue of returning military personnel, particularly those with mental problems like PTSD, is acknowledged as a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>. The current government ("Politburo 2.0") is not actively addressing this, but the speaker's team has a plan to manage it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:37">[00:40:37]</a>. This plan involves registering individuals with PTSD for psychiatric or special registration, providing special medications to enable their integration into society, drawing on experiences from other countries and Russia's own history (e.g., Afghanistan, Chechen wars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:52">[00:40:52]</a>.

Valery Solovey addressed questions regarding the likelihood and nature of significant political changes in Russia, distinguishing between revolution, political crisis, and turmoil.

## Predicting Revolution vs. Political Crisis

While no one has ever been able to predict a revolution anywhere in the world with accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, it is possible to predict a [[potential_political_crisis_in_russia | political crisis]] with a very high degree of accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Solovey asserts that a [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | political crisis in Russia]] is inevitable this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### The Theory of Revolution

Solovey disagrees with Abbas Galyamov's theory that a revolution occurs when the authorities' actions to prevent it begin to frighten more than the revolution itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. He states that such a pattern has never existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## The Likely Course of the Crisis: Unrest and Turmoil

The most probable course of the inevitable [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | political crisis]] is in the form of unrest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Igor Strelkov also shares this view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

Another term discussed is "turmoil," often mentioned by Girkin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>. Turmoil is defined as "a set of conflicts of various types, nature, and intensity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. It can be seen as a replacement for revolution or a combination of revolution and civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Solovey considers this a more likely development of the [[potential_political_crisis_in_russia | political crisis]] that is inevitable in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

## Role of Security Forces

In the event of unrest, an order to fire on the populace will likely be given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. However, this order is expected to be blocked with high probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. In the best-case scenario for the people, security forces will remain neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. While rare, there might be "brave romantics renegades" who go over to the side of the protesters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## Duration and Consequences of the Crisis

Regarding a survey by the American Atlantic Council predicting the disintegration of the Russian Federation within 10 years of "troubled times," Solovey's attitude remains unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. He highlights the "10 years of troubled times" remark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>, suggesting that if the [[political_crisis_and_instability_in_russia | political crisis]] is politically long, much in Russia will be called into question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>. However, if the crisis is short-term (maximum one and a half to two years), he believes nothing threatening the integrity of the Russian Federation will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>.

## Economic Implications

The likelihood of an [[political_crisis_and_economic_implications_in_russia | economic crisis]] in Russia is assessed as quite high, with reasons being primarily political rather than purely economic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. While not expecting a complete "collapse" where the economy ceases to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>, there will be serious problems including mass impoverishment, logistics disruptions, national currency fever, and high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:41">[00:26:41]</a>. However, Solovey maintains a strange optimism, noting that "our stories were much harder" and these challenges can be survived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.

## Outlook for Russia's Future

Solovey states that 2023 has every chance of being the year when Russians can decisively change their own fate, the fate of their people, and their country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:54">[00:30:54]</a>. He encourages readiness for this change, asserting that victory will definitely be theirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.

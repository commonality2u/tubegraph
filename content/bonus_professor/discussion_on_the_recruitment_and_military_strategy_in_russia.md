As of early May, the internal and international situation of the [[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_strategy | Russian Federation]] is summarized by the proverb, "fought, had fun, counted, shed tears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Traditionally, the period between May 1st and May 9th in Russia is for reporting successes and victories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:05">[02:02:05]</a>. However, the current [[russian_military_strategy_and_challenges | Russian military strategy and challenges]] indicate a lack of success.

## Military Situation and Anticipation of Offensive

The Russian armed forces cannot report any achievements on the fields of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. Bakhmut has not been taken, despite previous announcements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:24">[02:22:24]</a>. An interview with Yevgeny Prigozhin at the end of April revealed that the situation on that section of the front, and the front as a whole, is "far from brilliant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:40">[02:38:40]</a>. There is no progress in other areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:52">[02:51:52]</a>.

Everyone is currently frozen in anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive, which is expected to be an offensive rather than a counteroffensive, as the Russian army lost its offensive potential long ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">[03:02:02]</a>. Aside from the Bakhmut direction, there have been no active offensive actions from the Russian side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

## Internal Impact and Security Concerns

In front-line regions of Russia adjacent to Ukraine, mass outdoor events related to May 1st and May 9th have been cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. Any events that will be held will be virtually online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. Parades have been cancelled even in the "deepest rear," including Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. Red Square is closed for quarantine in preparation for the parade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>, and the air part of the parade has been cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.

These cancellations are attributed to alleged Ukrainian drone activity, which Moscow fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Drones have been observed flying to Moscow, putting the capital under elements of a "siege or semi-siege state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. The number of Russian Guard patrols in Moscow's public places has reportedly surprised residents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

## [[russias_military_strategy_and_internal_debates | Military Expectations and Vulnerabilities]]

The Russian military has "gloomy expectations" regarding the anticipated Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. While military success for Ukraine is not a foregone conclusion, it appears probable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Russian General Staff officers are reportedly taking seriously the prospect of fighting on Crimean territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

There is concern that if Ukrainian forces reach the border with Crimea, their missiles could cover the Kerch bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. The destruction of this bridge would cut off all communication with Crimea, effectively turning it into an island <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. This possibility is not considered illusory but "relatively, and maybe even more than real" by the Russian military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

## [[challenges_in_recruiting_contract_soldiers_in_russia | Recruitment Challenges and Personnel Shortages]]

The ongoing advertising campaign for recruiting contract soldiers offers significant incentives, but its successes are reportedly not great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. The campaign aimed to recruit and send between 400,000 to 500,000 contract soldiers to the front <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>. If this fails, discussion about [[mobilization_and_military_policies_in_russia | mobilization]] will intensify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. Summonses are already being delivered in St. Petersburg, with stamps indicating restrictive measures for non-compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

There is a significant shortage of personnel and ammunition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. Yevgeny Prigozhin of Wagner PMC has explicitly stated the personnel and ammunition shortages on the front line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. To compensate for these shortages, especially in anticipation of a Ukrainian offensive, there is an intensive recruitment of prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. While previously conducted by Wagner PMC, now the Ministry of Defense and private military companies like Redut, supervised by the General Staff, are engaged in this recruitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. These efforts have intensified in recent weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.

## Leadership and [[impact_of_international_relations_on_russias_military_strategy | International Isolation]]

The primary problem for Russia is identified as located at "Moscow, the Kremlin, President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. He is perceived by some as a "key problem," "key threat," and "toxic asset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. The President's health is a source of tension within the establishment, as it is known to be "extremely bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. Last week, the President did not appear at public events, with a "double" appearing instead, including at the opening of the Turkish nuclear power plant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. There is doubt whether the real President will attend the May 9th parade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

The discussion of presidential doubles is intensifying, not only outside Russia but also within, forcing indirect reactions from figures like Dmitry Peskov <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a>. This idea has become a "media reality" and a "reality of public opinion" in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

In international relations, the president is seen as isolated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>. South Africa has reportedly asked Vladimir Putin not to fly to a planned conference in August, suggesting he participate via video link instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. The President has generally decided against international trips, possibly with the exception of Minsk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.

Evidence of worsening establishment attitudes includes a conversation between billionaire Roman Trotsenko and businessman Nikolai Matushevsky, which contains "vivid characteristics" of the current situation and the future, critiquing the president and his policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:28:00">[14:28:00]</a>.

Further proof of international isolation and deteriorating relations is the conversation between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:44:00">[15:44:00]</a>. A few days after this conversation, Zelensky stated that China consented not to supply weapons to the [[russian_foreign_policy_and_military_operations | Russian Federation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>. This suggests China is "comparing watches" not only with Moscow but also with Kyiv in anticipation of the Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.

## Prigozhin's Dire Warnings

Yevgeny Prigozhin's interview with Pegov, a war correspondent, frankly discussed the current and near-future state of affairs on the fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:54:00">[16:54:00]</a>. He expressed significant fears regarding the success of a Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:15:00">[17:15:00]</a>. Prigozhin explicitly stated that he would not be to blame for failure, emphasizing that Wagner cannot solve all problems due to ammunition and personnel limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:32:00">[17:32:00]</a>. His "brazen statements" indicate he understands the situation is "gone to hell," or will be significantly so if the Ukrainian offensive succeeds in May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>.

## Government Response: Increased Repression

The authorities' only response to the deteriorating situation is to tighten internal repressions against those considered the "fifth column" or "traitors of the Motherland" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>. This policy is described as "dangerous" and "very painful" for those who retain a civil temperament and dare to express their own opinions in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>.

The [[impact_of_propaganda_and_media_sources_in_russia | impact of propaganda]] on Russian society is described as dehumanizing and contributing to a prevalent societal cruelty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Dehumanizing Effects of Propaganda
Propaganda plays a significant role in shaping perceptions during military conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. When individuals are consistently told they are fighting "Nazis, scoundrels, mercenaries of the West," they cease to perceive their opponents as human <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. This phenomenon, referred to as "anthropological minimization" in sociology, leads to a destructive and dehumanizing [[impact_of_political_propaganda_in_russia | impact of propaganda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

## Societal Cruelty
Beyond political propaganda, a pre-existing "very cruel" nature within Russian society is identified as a contributing factor to observed behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. This cruelty is often unnoticed by those within the society, becoming absorbed as an element of everyday socialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. The speaker suggests that this societal cruelty, evident in daily interactions from family to kindergarten, precedes political indoctrination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. The speaker views this as a "colossal defect" rather than a virtue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.

## Government Perception of Public Sentiment
From the Kremlin's perspective, the first stage of mobilization was considered successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Despite a lack of desire, people "meekly went to mobilization points and also meekly goes to the front" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The Kremlin reportedly disregards letters from the front that reach relatives, believing that those mobilized "have nowhere to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This reflects a perception of public compliance, likely influenced by the prevailing [[state_propaganda_and_media_influence_in_russia | state propaganda]] and the [[public_opinion_and_its_impact_on_russian_political_dynamics | public opinion]] it cultivates.

## Future Projections and Societal Response
The speaker predicts a second, more comprehensive stage of mobilization will be announced after the New Year holidays, likely in mid-January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This will occur within the framework of Kiriyenko's concept of a "people's war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The expansion of martial law to include the capital and large cities is also anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. These measures, including restrictions on travel and civil liberties, are expected to happen with "very high probability" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This intensification of political actions will further test the [[impact_of_the_conflict_on_russian_society | impact of the conflict on Russian society]] and its response to state directives.

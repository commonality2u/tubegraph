This article discusses potential [[sociopolitical_changes_in_russia | sociopolitical changes]] and [[internal_reforms_and_future_of_russian_governance | internal reforms]] in Russia, as well as the current [[political_and_economic_conditions_in_russia | political and economic conditions]].

## Dynamic Political Landscape

Circumstances on a national scale, especially concerning the "Supreme Authority," change frequently, affecting plans and goals [00:01:14]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Change is seen as a natural process, with plans and goals adapting to evolving circumstances [00:01:48]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

The positions of Patrushev's group are reportedly weakening quickly [00:02:54]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. While they sought to strengthen control, evidenced by elements like the digital ruble, their intentions did not include "digital physical slavery" [00:03:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Societal Mood and Engagement

Recent sociological data on societal moods are not publicly available or have not been seen [00:03:22]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Regarding public engagement with political calls, the speaker suggests that unlike the perceived lack of support for Strelkov, future calls will be responded to because the proponents expect to be in a different capacity and will offer "some guarantees" [00:06:10]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. People are advised to return to Russia, particularly the capital, if they wish to participate in unfolding events, especially around the turn of August and September [00:06:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Elections and Future Leadership

Participation in current elections is questioned due to their "derogatory, offensive to common sense, dignity manner" [00:08:57]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. However, if residual elements of competition exist and a candidate is favored, voting is still an option [00:09:12]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

A "team" has a highly worthy candidate for the presidential chair, with good chances of recognition and election [00:09:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

### Post-Regime Change Actions

After a change in power, a polygraph detector is deemed necessary for new management appointments, though it is not a panacea [00:10:00]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

There will be a broad amnesty for political and "near-political" articles, and rehabilitation for those innocently convicted [00:13:44]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

The new government will aim to saturate the market and satisfy demand for imported cars by significantly reducing duties, similar to China's approach to developing its automobile industry [00:21:51]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

Relaxation on large bank loans can be expected after a change of power [00:22:30]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>. Individuals are advised to prioritize their family's survival over paying off loans if it jeopardizes their well-being [00:22:39]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:39">[00:22:39]</a>.

## [[Reforms_and_future_directions_for_Russia | Reforms and Future Directions for Russia]]

### Economic and Social Welfare

The current income levels for most Russians are "humiliatingly little" [00:10:35]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Future salaries for professionals like teachers, doctors, and Ministry of Emergency Situations employees should be commensurate with officials' salaries [00:10:24]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Incomes, pensions, and social payments will be increased, as the country has sufficient funds [00:10:38]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

While some villages can be revived, a general revival is likely an irreversible process [00:19:21]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>. However, with technology and improved quality of life, it is possible to achieve a decent life for people in Russia who have earned it through their labor and dedication [00:19:34]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

### Healthcare and Education

Radical [[social_and_political_reforms_necessary_for_russias_future | reforms]] of healthcare and education are planned, aiming for "good, understandable reforms" [00:11:03]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Key changes will include reducing paperwork for teachers and doctors [00:11:23]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

Regarding the Unified State Exam (USE), while its implementation had flaws in some regions, the underlying idea is considered a "very good method" for grades and ensuring social mobility, allowing students from remote regions to enter elite universities [00:11:53]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

### Law Enforcement and Justice System

The current system within the Ministry of Internal Affairs, despite containing decent individuals, needs to be changed [00:20:28]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. A gradual change will begin by altering the system's rules and replacing "system-forming elements" at the top [00:20:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:41">[00:20:41]</a>. Those who committed crimes against society will be punished [00:20:57]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

A special service or department will be created to restore citizens' constitutional rights violated over the past 20-30 years [00:21:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. This service will also make recommendations for punishing those responsible for violating these rights [00:21:28]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

Fraud with bank cards is primarily originating from Russian territory, despite official reports suggesting otherwise [00:14:27]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Changes are expected after a regime change [00:14:16]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

## Communication and Transparency

Future leadership intends to maintain constant "reverse direct feedback" with society to understand public sentiment, moving away from the current "humiliating offensive comedic manner" of communication, such as presidential direct lines or press conferences [00:12:28]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

The speaker aims to participate in historical events rather than just writing about them [00:14:46]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. After these events, there may be memoirs, though not everything will be disclosed [00:15:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

Many "special objects," palaces, bunkers, and occult places are expected to be declassified and opened for public viewing soon [00:15:43]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

## Military and Conflict Resolution

The confrontation is hoped to end by the end of 2023, potentially entering into peace or truce negotiations [00:03:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The speaker notes, "a bad peace is better than a good quarrel" [00:04:01]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Preliminary agreement for negotiations exists, but not on a peace formula [00:04:41]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Mobilization serves to demonstrate a country's readiness to continue and increase military efforts, with mobilized individuals potentially being sent to the front with minimal preparation [00:05:08]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Organizationally and technically, everything is ready for mobilization, which will be carried out "in a much tougher manner" than previously [00:05:43]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Negotiations are expected to be with Russia's leadership, not specifically with Putin, as he will no longer be able to participate [00:16:04]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. The Ukrainian people's stance against "peace in exchange for territory" may change if Western military support is withdrawn [00:16:21]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. The situation is currently leaning towards a "stalemate, a positional war" [00:17:19]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>. No realistic alternative to a truce or peace is currently seen [00:17:31]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.

The cessation of bombing in Ukraine post-Putin depends on his successor; some may continue military confrontation, while others might declare an immediate unilateral ceasefire and begin talks without preconditions [00:17:50]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

The experience of the Russian-Ukrainian confrontation suggests a future shift to a contract professional army [00:18:48]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy

Patriotism is defined as love for one's country and people, not the state, with a desire to improve life for the nation, making it freer, wealthier, and more peaceful and protected [00:07:18]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. The speaker identifies as a "100% Patriot" [00:07:49]<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

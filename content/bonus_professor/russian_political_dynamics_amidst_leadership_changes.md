The current political landscape in Russia is characterized by significant internal dynamics, particularly concerning the country's leadership and its implications for both domestic and international affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

## Focus on Internal Power Struggles
For the Russian military-political leadership, the internal situation, specifically the resolution of the "Supreme Authority" issue, has come to the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. This is distinct from presidential elections, which are viewed as mere formalities if they occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Putin's Health and Doubles
It is asserted that the current president, Vladimir Putin, is living out his "last days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>, not months or weeks. His "double or two" are reportedly successfully replacing him, even making international visits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. An instance is cited where an alleged double, not the real president, used an expletive in a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. China is aware of dealing with a double but observes the situation to assess suitability of the junior partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.

There are claims that Putin, before his alleged physical departure, expressed a wish for succession to follow the Constitution, meaning that [[mishustin | Mishustin]] would become the acting president, rather than a double replacing him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

## Shifting Power Dynamics
Within the president's inner circle, the main "trump cards" are currently held by a large coalition led by [[nikolai_patrushev | Nikolai Patrushev]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>. While Patrushev's coalition's victory is deemed probable, it is not considered guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Regardless, this shift will profoundly impact the disposition and balance among Russia's highest elites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. The emerging dynamics are described as "absolutely unpredictable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>.

## Instability and Future Outlook
A double is unlikely to replace the president for an extended period, as informed individuals are "absolutely sure" this is not feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. A consensus among the highest layer of the Russian elite (around 50 people) is deemed impossible to achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. The previous consensus, which lasted two decades, was centered around the president's figure as the system's core and moderator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Putin's departure is expected to lead not merely to an imbalance but to the system's "rapid fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

Russia is now entering a period of "highest turbulence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>. While the immediate effects might not be noticeable to citizens, this turbulence is expected to become evident, potentially leading to an "overflow of the square and the street" in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. Many unexpected events, twists, and "strange faces" are anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

### Callout: Important Note
> The speaker believes Russia is moving at a breakneck speed towards events that will change the fate of the country and its citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. Citizens are encouraged to support ongoing efforts, initially through financial means, as overt civil activity is currently punishable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. The speaker expresses confidence that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

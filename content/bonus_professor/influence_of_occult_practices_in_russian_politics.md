In addition to traditional political intrigues, high-ranking Russian officials and elite groups resort to [[occult_practices_in_russian_politics | occult means]] to influence political outcomes and preserve their positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>. This includes engaging shamans and performing various rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.

## Types of Occult Practices

Different departments and influential circles in Russia prefer different [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | occult styles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:24">[00:24:24]</a>:
*   Some turn to Siberian shamans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>.
*   Others invite shamans from Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.
*   The settlement of major political events can be accompanied by shamanic journeys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>.
*   "Black magic" practices, not necessarily implying human sacrifice, are also employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>. These can involve the shedding of blood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.
*   The sacrifice of a black rooster and a black goat, including the extraction of the heart, is a rite that has become "quite popular now in Moscow in narrow circles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. This represents a shift from "red threads of Kabbalah" to more drastic rituals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a>.

The demand for such practices has sharply increased, particularly in the last year, as officials perceive the situation to be changing and their status quo radically uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. They seek any available tools, including magic and [[occultism_and_magical_practices_in_russia | occultism]], to preserve their assets and positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>. This even extends to a primitive approach to Orthodoxy, which they may view as a form of magic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.

## Seeking "Masters" and Their Motivations

Those involved in these practices are aware that true "masters" (individuals with genuine abilities) exist, but they struggle to find them for initiation or guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:01">[00:26:01]</a>.

An academic's attempt to research the [[influence_of_occultism_in_russian_politics | influence of occultism]] on Russian politics revealed that individuals with "colossal resources" who consult these "miracle workers" or "forces of darkness" (some of whom are charlatans, others possessing surprising abilities) are not interested in "knowledge of the truth" or "penetration into secrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. Their primary concerns are:
*   Before 2020: How to increase their fortune and strengthen their positions of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>.
*   After 2020: How to save their assets and positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>.
*   The "true future" is never a topic of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.

This indicates a "lack of support and the lack of personal such inside meaning children of the core" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>.

## Historical and Societal Perceptions

The current Russian elite attempts to draw legitimacy from contradictory historical figures like Stalin, Nikolai II, Kolchak, and Denikin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. They legitimize their power by invoking any figure who, from their propaganda perspective, "preserved order" or "restored it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:28">[00:29:28]</a>. The only figure they find deeply antipathetic is Lenin, as he personifies the destruction of the status quo and the old order, a "revolutionary tradition" they consider "substantially unacceptable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.

A significant portion of the Russian population, about half, believes in the existence of a "world government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>. This belief extends even to top Russian officials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:54">[00:50:54]</a>. This perception creates a problem: if policy is not based on national values or public interests, officials become insecure about their own legitimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. This insecurity leads them to search for "real rulers of this world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>. They discover the existence of powerful non-public organizations but are often excluded from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:52">[00:51:52]</a>.

## Self-Doubt and Brutal Tactics

The [[mystical_beliefs_among_russian_elite | self-doubt]] within the Russian authorities is a "supporting mental construct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>. This internal weakness leads them to frequently resort to repression, brutal tones, and lines of behavior in an attempt to instill confidence in their own strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>. A strong person does not need to demonstrate their machismo; such displays indicate serious internal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a>. The Russian authorities are described as "very afraid" of change, losing control, and even the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>. They believed the West was corruptible, only to discover values and organizations that cannot be bought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>.# [[Occult practices in Russian politics | Influence of Occult Practices in Russian Politics]]

## Seeking "Masters" and Their Motivations

Different factions involved in the fight for power in Russia, such as Kovalchuk, Timchenko, Igor Ivanovich, Patrushev, Dmitry, and Sergey Kuzhugetovich, resort to [[occult_practices_in_russian_politics | occult means]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

The [[mystical_beliefs_among_russian_elite | self-doubt]] within the Russian authorities is a "supporting mental construct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:07]</a>.

This fear and self-doubt drive their actions, including their desire to preserve assets at any cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:08">[00:54:08]</a>. This is evidenced by the transfer of assets into physical forms (tons of dollars and gold) and their storage in hard-to-access locations like Africa or Latin America, mimicking strategies used by Nazis in the 1940s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:14">[00:54:14]</a>.

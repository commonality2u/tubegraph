Leri Solovey announced the death of Russian President Vladimir Putin in his Valdai residence on the evening of Thursday, October 26th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Solovey had previously stated publicly multiple times that Putin would not survive the fall and would likely die earlier, with public video evidence of these predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Efforts to Conceal and Suppress
The immediate aftermath of Putin's death involves attempts to conceal it, a common practice in authoritarian regimes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Historical examples cited include the deaths of Heydar Aliyev, Hugo Chavez, and Islam Karimov, which were hidden for three months, and Zhirinovsky's death, concealed for a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### Information Suppression Tactics
Since the announcement of Putin's death, a wave of curses, insults, lies, and ridicule has been directed at those disseminating the information, and attempts have been made to hack accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. However, Solovey argues that the more refutations and lies are spread on a topic, the faster the information disseminates and involves new groups in the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. This phenomenon is described as an "information shell" growing "like a snowball" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The government is criticized for making tactical errors by attempting to refute the information instead of trying to contain or ignore it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### Use of a Double
Putin's death is reportedly easier to hide because a double, or "deuce" as referred to in Federal Security Service jargon, has been successfully used to replace him for the past two to three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This double can be used for a short period, estimated at a maximum of two to three months, to manage the transition to a post-Putin era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Maintaining the Status Quo
The immediate strategy appears to be an attempt to maintain the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This means there will be no increase in liberties or freedoms, nor will there be a reduction in military tension on the fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Instead, further tightening of controls is expected, as the government is fearful of [[public_opinion_and_its_impact_on_russian_political_dynamics | public reaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. A decision to maintain a firm stance, particularly concerning Ukraine, was made in October when Putin was no longer able to negotiate from a strong position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Consequences of the Death
Despite the attempts to maintain stability, the speaker suggests that Putin's death has "torn the core out of the regime he created" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. This regime is predicted to begin collapsing, "just like an avalanche," and will not be salvageable under any circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Call to Action and Outlook
Solovey asserts that "everything is not bad at all" and expresses confidence in the unfolding events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. He highlights that a "window" of opportunity is opening, and the future will largely depend on the actions of the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Public Engagement
Individuals are encouraged to choose the "right side of history" and to stand with those fighting for freedom and justice for Russia and for changing the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Practical ways to contribute include:
*   Reposting information to ensure its dissemination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Liking content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   Providing financial assistance, which is considered "extremely important" as "money is the blood of politics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

Events are expected to develop rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Solovey emphasizes the importance of [[preserving_life_health_and_property_during_unstable_times | maintaining health]], sound mind, sound memory, and good physical shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. The belief is expressed that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

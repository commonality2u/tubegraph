## Current State of Military Course and Negotiations

The current military course of the Russian Federation is expected to begin a gradual shift towards finding a peaceful solution after December 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. While "hawks" would like to extend their "Carte Blanche" until January 20, they have not received consent for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. Despite this, they are expected to try to extend their influence, potentially laying down elements of provocations, recalling events from Russia's history 30 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

Cautious but tangible steps towards a peaceful solution are already being taken, including at the fronts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Timeline for Cessation of Hostilities

Regarding the cessation of hostilities:
*   A stop in hostilities by the end of this year is considered unlikely (1-25% probability) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:24">[00:47:24]</a>.
*   A stop in hostilities by the end of January 2025 has a higher-than-low probability (25-45%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>.

There is a high chance of a truce being concluded by the beginning of next year, even if not by the end of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. This would mean a sharp decrease in the intensity of military action, though not yet a full-fledged peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:10">[00:42:10]</a>.

## Benefits of a Truce for Ukraine

A truce, even on terms like returning part of territory in exchange for Ukraine joining NATO, would offer significant benefits for Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. These include:
*   An end to the killing of citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:41">[00:25:41]</a>.
*   The possibility for those forced to leave their homeland to return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.
*   The opportunity to begin returning to peaceful life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>.
*   The understanding that a truce is a beginning, not an end, and the ultimate outcome of [[peace_proposals_and_negotiations_between_russia_and_ukraine | peace negotiations]] could be different from the initial agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:06">[00:26:06]</a>.

It is asserted that if there is even the slightest chance to achieve peace, it must be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>.

## Economic and Strategic Factors

### Role of the Military-Industrial Complex
The military-industrial complex is expected to be a "colossal winner" regardless of whether military actions stop, as there will be a need to replenish lost reserves and forge new equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. This applies to the military-industrial complex of all countries involved in the confrontation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

### Sanctions and Economic Recovery
The lifting of sanctions, or at least not introducing new ones, is expected to have a positive effect on the Russian economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. However, this process will take time, listed in months, and some even in years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:25">[00:42:25]</a>. There is no expectation of an instant magical recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:35">[00:42:35]</a>.

During consultations, a mutual decision has been made that compensation will be paid to the Ukrainian side using frozen Russian assets in Europe, effectively meaning these assets are "irretrievably lost" for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.

### Influence within Russian Elites
Dmitry Kozak is noted as one of the few individuals who objected to the start of the conflict in its second year, acting courageously and with dignity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>. He holds no influence on the decisions of Politburo 2.0 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.

The speaker notes that elite discontent is not solely caused by ongoing military actions, but also by "fundamental differences" concerning the future paths of Russia and its ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. These contradictions are described as irreconcilable within the current "Putin model" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

> "you understand that the military-industrial complex will be a colossal winner in any case imagine military actions stopped Yes Truce and then peace that the military-industrial complex will stop working on the contrary the military-industrial complex will have to open an even wider front of work because it is necessary to replenish irretrievably lost reserves and it is necessary to forge new equipment and this will be the military-industrial complex of all countries that are somehow involved in the confrontation between [[russianukrainian_relations_and_military_tensions | Russia]] and Ukraine, those that help Ukraine, for example, from the West, and for the military-industrial complex - this is just Razdolye So what seems like ironclad logic to you is not really so" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>

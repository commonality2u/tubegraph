Professor Valery Solovyov announced an upcoming meeting in Perm on December 2nd, emphasizing its focus on [[historical_and_political_parallels_in_russia | historical analogies]] rather than current politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

## Event Details
The meeting will take place on December 2nd at 6:00 PM local time in the Ural city of Perm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The event will not be broadcast online, nor will a recording be made available; it is exclusively for in-person attendees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Tickets are required for entry and are described as "not cheap," but they offer the opportunity to ask questions, including privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

## Focus on History
Solovyov stated that the event will explore how history can aid in understanding the present and predicting the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. He intends to discuss "working analogies" and "fruitful historical parallels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Historical Context Mentioned
In the emergency broadcast on November 11, Solovyov drew a parallel between the current political situation and Russia's defeat in the Crimean War (1853-1856) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. He noted that Emperor Nicholas I, who took responsibility for that defeat, died from inflammation after refusing treatment, despite his initial belief in the Russian army's invincibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Solovyov suggested that the current situation represents a "complete final fiasco" of 22 years of Putin's rule, policy, and system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

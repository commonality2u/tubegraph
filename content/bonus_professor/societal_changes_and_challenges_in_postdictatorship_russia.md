Valery Solovey discusses several anticipated societal and political changes, as well as challenges, that a new government in Russia would address.

## Legal and Governance Reforms

### Civil Service and Epilepsy
The current legislation in Russia is considered extremely imperfect, as it prevents individuals with epilepsy from working in the civil service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. If Valery Solovey's team comes to power, the law on accepting people with a mild form of epilepsy into the civil service would be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This is viewed as a solvable problem, with historical examples like Gaius Julius Caesar showing that many epileptics were outstanding statesmen and political figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Lustration of the Judicial System
A key principle of the proposed changes is the lustration of the entire judicial corps, including the Supreme and Constitutional Courts, with no exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. For employees of the judicial system's apparatus, such as case manufacturers and clerks, lustration would apply primarily to high-level officials like heads of departments, rather than all employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. This flexible and realistic approach aims to avoid chaos and emptiness in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The process of lustration for the judicial corps is expected to take some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### Restoration of Constitutional Legality
All laws and by-laws that worsen living conditions or harm people, often seeming like sabotage, would be repealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. People who suffered under these laws would receive compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. A special department or division, possibly called the "Department of Management" or "Service for the Restoration of Constitutional Legality," is proposed to manage this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

### Fate of Propagandists
Regarding propagandists, it is hoped that they will face consequences, with a chance of being brought to justice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.

## Sociopolitical Changes and International Relations

### Separation of Church and State
The church would be truly separated from the state and would not interfere in matters of public education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The church itself would decide on its need for reform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Integration into NATO and the European Union
Russia's policy would not be aimed at immediate integration into NATO or the European Union due to the unlikelihood of such a scenario being accepted by these institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Instead, the task in the coming years, after the cessation of hostilities and a change in leadership, is to establish normal working relations with European institutions and NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Consultations on this matter are reportedly already underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This could lead to the lifting of most sanctions within 2-3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Protection of Compatriots Abroad
The new government would use exclusively civilized and peaceful means to protect Russian-speaking populations abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

### Relationship with China
The team behind Valery Solovey was the first to warn about secret agreements with China that diminish Russian sovereignty and could turn Russia into a semi-colony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. These agreements involve China providing political and military support to the Russian Federation in exchange for Russia remaining silent about the origins and culprits of the COVID pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>. The team is against such diminution of sovereignty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:09">[00:25:09]</a>.

## Economic and Social Challenges

### Improving Living Standards
A detailed and high-quality economic program exists that would increase the cost of living, family benefits, and pensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>. This program, which the General SVR channel will introduce, is designed to regulate the market in response to rising prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>.

### Gasification of Villages and Towns
The problem of gasification of villages and towns, particularly in the Central Federal District and the West, would be solved more intensively by the new team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. This is considered a solvable problem with some effort in a short timeframe, considering economic efficiency and feasibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:30">[00:25:30]</a>.

### Migration Policy
The migrant problem would be solved comprehensively, systematically, and effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>. This includes reducing the visa regime and, if necessary, mass deportations of those who illegally entered or gained Russian citizenship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.

### Food Security
While famine is not expected, there may be shortages of certain products due to potential crop failures in Kazakhstan and some regions of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:31">[00:41:31]</a>. Past analytical predictions included several food crises, particularly concerning cereals and possibly vegetable products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges and Dictatorship

### The End of Dictatorship
The dictatorship in Russia will end when people start to fight against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>. The regime persists because many people are satisfied or afraid of change, preferring the status quo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. People are encouraged to make small, safe efforts, such as providing financial assistance or subscribing to Telegram channels, as forms of civic activism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. The collapse of the regime is definitely expected to come, possibly by autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>.

### Public Consciousness and Propaganda
Many Russians support the current regime and are "infected with ideas of revanchism and superiority over other nations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>. To change this, the "propaganda switch" needs to be turned off, and socialization should be conducted differently, explaining that Russia's interests lie in a peaceful, calm, free, and prosperous life within its borders, without threatening other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:04">[00:41:04]</a>.

### Current Challenges and State of Society
There is an observed paralysis among high-ranking military officials, who allow themselves to be easily deprived of everything by the FSB, reminiscent of the 1930s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This lack of resistance is attributed to effective military counterintelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. A key question posed is why society allowed what has been done to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The speaker highlights that many people listen but do not hear or understand simple messages, indicating "problems with communication" within society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>.

## Other Future Considerations

### Capital Relocation
While previously a supporter of moving the capital to Siberia, possibly building a new city called Vladi-Sibirsk to reflect a shift in economic and demographic focus to the Asia-Pacific region, the speaker is now less enthusiastic about this specific idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:07">[00:37:07]</a>. An alternative consideration is distributing capital functions among multiple cities, similar to the Constitutional Court's move to St. Petersburg <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>.

### Nuclear Weapons Policy
The current leadership responsible for Russia's military policy is described as more realistic and less "bloodthirsty" than the late Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. They understand the risks of using tactical nuclear weapons, and there is an oral agreement with the Americans that nuclear weapons will not be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>. Threats are considered rhetorical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:52">[00:26:52]</a>.

### Economic Forecasts
The consensus forecast of Russian economists predicts the dollar exchange rate this year to be in the range of 100-120 rubles per dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

### Pandemic Response
Russia has "spit on" all pandemic agreements, including those with the WHO, and does not fulfill any obligations towards the WHO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. There is a noticeable increase in COVID incidence in Moscow, which is not being publicly discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

### Decline in Police Force
People are leaving the police force en masse due to hard, unsafe working conditions, including the risk of being sent to "new territories" for service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>.

### Hybrid Operations
A hybrid operation does not require a significant military contingent, at least in its initial stages, allowing it to be carried out simultaneously with mobilization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Part of the hybrid operation involves the destabilization of the situation in European countries that actively support Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. Russian military intelligence is often involved in such activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.

### Crisis and Inflation
A severe crisis and high inflation will precede the denomination of the ruble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. A political crisis in Russia is unfolding and remains highly relevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>.

The current political landscape in Russia is characterized by a leadership transition following the death of "the late Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This transition has unveiled complex [[internal_political_dynamics_and_power_transition_in_russia | internal political dynamics and power transition in Russia]] among various ruling groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

## Post-Putin Governance and Systemic Issues

Despite the change in leadership, the new government is described as continuing the "criminal" and "corrupt" practices of the previous regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that if the country is ruled by the "same crooks, thieves, and murderers," life for the populace will not improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. The speaker's team aims to "radically change the situation in the country" and "the very foundations on which society is based" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, rather than merely seizing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

A key distinction is drawn between a mere change in leadership and a dismantling of the underlying "tyranny." True "post-puncture penalties" and systemic improvements will only arise when "the foundations of tyranny are dismantled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Key Factions and Their Influence

Two dominant coalitions are identified as having significant influence on the internal agenda: Patrushev's group and Chemezov's group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### The Chemezov Group (Chemezov's Tower)

The "Chemezov tower" includes Manturov, Dyumin, and a number of high-ranking officers from the FSB (not all FSB officers are guided by Patrushev) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, as well as high-ranking officers of the Foreign Intelligence Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Chemezov reportedly has "excellent relations" with the Foreign Intelligence Service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, likely due to his role in acquiring Western technological achievements for Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### The Patrushev Group

[[political_dynamics_and_potential_leadership_change_in_russia | Patrushev's influence]] is highlighted, particularly concerning his reliance on analysts within the Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. These analysts provide reports on problems facing the Russian Federation, and Patrushev seeks solutions based on his worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. His forecasts are said to largely coincide with the speaker's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

### Power Struggles and Transition Attempts

The authorities initially struggled to carry out a smooth [[internal_political_dynamics_and_power_transition_in_russia | power transition]] after Putin's death due to a failure to agree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Patrushev advocated for a rapid transition before January 1, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, but groups opposing him "categorically against them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. An agreement appears to have been reached, with further developments expected in late summer or early autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

The "Politburo 2.0," which includes the person acting as President, is expected to resign before the end of 2024, likely in autumn or late autumn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The members of Politburo 2.0 communicate via video conference due to mutual dislike and avoidance of personal meetings, allowing them to discuss issues and make decisions promptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

Some figures, like Kovalchuk, have seen their ability to influence the [[russias_political_situation_and_leadership | struggle for the future]] "dramatically decreased" after Putin's death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Medvedev, on the other hand, remains untouched by current reshuffles because "no one needs him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. Under the new government, Medvedev's fate is anticipated to include treatment for alcoholism and then legal accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.

## Foreign Policy Stances of Key Groups

The two main factions hold differing views on the end of the conflict:
*   **Patrushev's group** supports a peace agreement based on recognizing the current territorial status quo, where the existing front line becomes the new border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   **Chemezov's group** advocates for a "very broad and very flexible compromise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

## The "Third Coalition" and Its Vision

The speaker identifies themselves as a public figure of a "third coalition" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Their goals are described as "noble and worthy," focusing on the development of Russian society, ensuring Russia's security, and protecting its national interests "exclusively by peaceful and civilized means" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This group's plans are expected to be implemented after a "short-term period of chaos" following the change of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:21">[00:26:21]</a>.

The speaker believes that the current system "cannot" exist longer than expected, as it has "exhausted its internal margin of safety" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>. The dynamics of change are developing "somewhat faster than we assumed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.

The speaker's team expects sanctions to be lifted "quite quickly" under their government, based on ongoing consultations with Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>. They also acknowledge the ongoing challenge of personnel shortages in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a> and the high cost of politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a>.

## The Fate of Putin's "Double"

The individual currently performing the duties of President is a double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, who is expected to resign from the post before the end of 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This double, like all people, suffers from a "cognitive fallacy" (the third-person effect), hoping that negative events will not happen to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. He will not be able to publicly declare his true identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Patrushev has not prepared a double for himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

## Other Relevant Dynamics

*   **Pavel Furgal**: Considered a "classic political prisoner," Furgal is expected to be released after the change of regime, along with all other political prisoners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. His release will critically depend on the nature of the new government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Duma's Role**: The Duma is viewed as a "weak-willed and pathetic appendage of the executive power" and effectively a department of the presidential administration, possessing no independent power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.
*   **Medvedev's Fate**: Medvedev is not part of the current power reshuffles because he is considered irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a>. Under a new government, he would face treatment for alcoholism and then legal processes according to the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **State of Russia**: The speaker maintains that Russia has not yet moved from a stage of crisis to a catastrophe of its life systems and believes such a catastrophe will be prevented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:11">[00:31:11]</a>.

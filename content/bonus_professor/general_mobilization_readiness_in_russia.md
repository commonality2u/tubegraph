Valery Solovey, in the 61st issue of his program "What is Happening," recorded on Sunday, April 16th, and broadcast on Monday, April 17th, 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, primarily discussed the topic of [[Mobilization in Russia and potential nationwide mobilization | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. He characterized the past week's information landscape as "everything about the upcoming [[potential_mobilization_and_military_service_changes_in_russia | mobilization]] and just a little bit about other news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## State of General Mobilization Readiness

According to Solovey, general [[military_preparations_and_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]] is not just in preparation but is already ready in organizational, technical, and legal terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. However, it will not be announced all at once but will proceed in a "non-stop mode" if initiated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This approach is necessitated by the technical, organizational, and personnel impossibility of immediately arming the 27 million people in Russia who are potentially subject to [[possibility_of_mobilization_in_the_russian_federation | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Individuals will be called into service as the need arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Once started, this [[mobilization_process_in_russia | mobilization]] will not stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

The speaker notes that the "partial [[military_operations_and_mobilization_in_russia | mobilization]]" that began on September 21st of the previous year was never formally completed, as there was no corresponding presidential decree to end it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Therefore, the specific name for the new process (e.g., general [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]], additional targeted [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]], or something else) is not important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

There is an urgent need for this [[russian_political_and_military_mobilization | mobilization]] because attempts to recruit 500,000 contract soldiers failed, with only a little over 2,000 people signing contracts despite intensive recruitment campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Based on the half-million target, one can estimate the number of people intended for [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]] during the first stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Practical Advice and Timelines

Individuals are advised to prepare for this [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. A key piece of advice is to save money in advance, as digital summons may immediately lead to the blocking of bank cards and accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This step should be taken before May 1st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

An indirect, but serious, sign of when the process might enter its practical phase is that defense enterprises have received instructions to prepare proposals for reserving their most important employees within the next two weeks, meaning by May 1st <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. While nothing will be announced during the May holidays, preparations should be made for after them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Connection to Martial Law

This [[general_mobilization_and_martial_law_in_russia | mobilization]] may become part of the preliminary preparations for extending martial law to the entire territory of Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Formally, martial law was introduced in Russia on September 21st but currently applies only to the "new territories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The authorities have a strong incentive to extend martial law to most or all of the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

The decision to declare martial law will depend on military-political dynamics, which are currently in the hands of the Armed Forces of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. There is a "meager" and "frankly meager" expectation of the Ukrainian offensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### Yevgeny Prigozhin's Calls for Peace

Recent appeals from Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of Wagner, calling for peace, are seen as evidence of this expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Prigozhin's message, which suggests the "task has already been completed" and it's time to "measure ourselves on that front line," is interpreted as a recognition of fear regarding the Ukrainian offensive and the high likelihood of the status quo changing in Ukraine's favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. The General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces reportedly believes the Ukrainian offensive will be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

Prigozhin's actions are described as preventive attempts to agree to a truce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. He understands that neither the Kremlin nor Kyiv will respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This reflects the establishment's mood, as they realize "things are getting worse and worse for the Russians" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Prigozhin's message is partly addressed to the Russian people and serves as excellent self-promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, often becoming the top news item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## Public Concerns in Russia

A Levada Center poll from March (with likely similar results in April) revealed the main concerns of Russian society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>:
*   **Rising prices:** 58% of respondents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Armed confrontation / "special military operation" / conflict with the West sanctions:** 33% of respondents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This highlights that Russians are more concerned with internal issues than the conflict in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Human rights violations / suppression of civil rights and freedoms:** 4% of respondents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. This low percentage aligns with the audience size of some pro-liberal media broadcasting from abroad (estimated at 4-7%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

Another poll on economic and social situation revealed that one in six Russian citizens lacks enough money for food and clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Four percent do not even have enough for food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. The demographic group in the worst economic situation, where 27% of those over 60 years old complained about not having enough money for food or clothing, is also the demographic group with the highest support for the Russian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Despite the "glaring reality" and "empty refrigerators," this group remains a key base of support for the president's policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Their support might be easier to provide as they are not threatened by the [[mobilization_and_military_readiness | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

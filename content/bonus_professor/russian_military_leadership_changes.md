The Russian military command overseeing the special military operation in Ukraine has undergone changes, which some analysts interpret as signs that the operation is not progressing as planned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. This contrasts with official propaganda efforts to suggest that everything is proceeding according to plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

## Commander Dvornikov's Appointment and Disappearance

In the first ten days of April, Commander Dvornikov, previously described as a "hero" of the Syrian campaign, was appointed to lead the operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. However, approximately two weeks prior to June 5, Dvornikov reportedly disappeared from public sight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

## New Command: Gennady Zhidko

Following Dvornikov's disappearance, unconfirmed information suggests that the operation now has a new commander: Colonel General Gennady Zhidko <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. Like Dvornikov, Zhidko had also received the star of the Hero of Russia for his participation in the Syrian campaign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Implications of Leadership Change
> The change in military command after only a little over a month suggests that the operation may not be proceeding as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. This is one of several indirect signs indicating that no significant breakthrough or turning point has been achieved in the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

These changes in [[russian_political_leadership_transitions_and_internal_power_dynamics | Russian military leadership]] coincide with broader [[political_dynamics_and_potential_leadership_change_in_russia | internal Russian political dynamics]] and concerns about the duration of the special military operation, which the Russian authorities have reportedly instructed official families not to emphasize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This suggests that the operation is not perceived as a "blitzkrieg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

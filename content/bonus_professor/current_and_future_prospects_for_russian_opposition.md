The Russian opposition currently faces significant challenges, including internal divisions and an environment hostile to political activity. However, there are discussions and expectations regarding its potential future role and impact.

## Current State of the Opposition
The notion that "positional forces" merely quarrel and do not consolidate is not entirely accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Consolidation, or at least association, is occurring within [[impact_on_russian_opposition | Russian political immigration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. This largely involves liberal-democratic groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

A notable exception is [[conflict_within_the_russian_opposition_and_its_implications | Navalny's team]], which maintains a distinct stance, believing it holds a leadership position within the opposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. The justification and counterproductiveness of these claims are open to judgment, and it is debated whether unification would benefit Navalny's team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

> [!INFO] Current Restrictions
> At present, any political or civic activity, including charity, is under outright ban or faces severe doubts in Russia, preventing consolidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>.

## Future Political Landscape and Goals
Despite current limitations, the long-term outlook suggests the possible and even highly probable emergence of an anti-regime coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. This coalition could encompass a broad spectrum of political views, including democrats, leftists, and right-wing Russian nationalists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. A historical parallel for such a broad front is the "Democratic Russia" movement from the late 1980s and early 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

The speaker's own political force has a program concept for a [[future_political_changes_in_russia | future Russia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. They assert that the current trajectory of the Russian president to turn Russia into a vassal of China will be reversed once they come to power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Key goals for a new government include:
*   **Decentralization and Federalization**: Regions should receive more freedoms, making Russia a true federation rather than one in name only <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:37">[00:32:37]</a>. This would start with expanding the financial and economic powers of the regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:50">[00:32:50]</a>. All constituent parts, whether republics or regions, should have equal rights and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>.
*   **Church and State Separation**: Supporters of a new Russia advocate for a real separation of church and state, allowing the church to determine its own leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
*   **Accountability for War**: There is an expectation that individuals responsible for planning, preparing, unleashing, or publicly calling for aggressive war (under Russian Criminal Code Articles 353 and 354) will be prosecuted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:27">[00:34:27]</a>.

## Internal Reforms and Policies
A new Russia is expected to implement significant internal reforms:
*   **Lustration**: There will be lustration, particularly of the judiciary, which is considered absolutely necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. The scope of lustration for other groups is under discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>.
*   **Pension Reform**: A necessary pension reform would include a special pension account for each citizen, with accumulated savings transferred to relatives if the person does not live to retirement age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. The retirement age would be rolled back to its previous indicator before the "so-called pension reform" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>.
*   **Burial of Lenin and Soviet Figures**: It is deemed "worthy" to bury Lenin and all those interred in the Kremlin wall in a single cemetery with state honors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This move is seen as necessary to "put an end to this story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **National Symbols**: A constituent assembly or constitutional conference establishing a new Russian Republic and adopting a new constitution will consider the issue of the coat of arms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Scientific Sphere**: The current Russian Academy of Sciences is viewed as decomposing and degrading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>. There is a need for a clear idea of reform for the scientific sphere, potentially involving a new organization to perform the functions of the Academy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

## International Relations under New Leadership
The speaker's political force states unequivocally that a new government will not pursue a policy towards Ukraine similar to Putin's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. Russia's future goal will be "only Russia," focusing on its own country and people rather than intervening in neighbors' affairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Non-Imperialistic Future
> The current armed confrontation is described as the "angling exhalation of a country that tried to return to imperial status" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, indicating Russia lacks the desire, resources, and moral will for such a path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

The status of Donbass and Crimea will be determined by peace negotiations, with their content largely dependent on military dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

A new Russian leadership will be directed towards dialogues and interaction with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:54">[00:29:54]</a>. They believe there will be sufficient strength to resist Chinese influence, especially with assistance from Western countries, Japan, and South Korea, who are interested in preventing Russia from becoming fully merged with China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.

Economic, scientific, and cultural ties with the West will be restored, although this process will take years rather than months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

## Outlook and Support
The speaker anticipates [[potential_political_changes_and_future_leadership_in_russia | significant political perturbations]] in Russia that will be "very serious, very deep, large-scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. This will inevitably cause dynamics within the Orthodox Church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:16">[00:34:16]</a>. The [[future_political_leadership_in_russia | next president]] after Putin will not be any of the currently discussed candidates from either the government or the opposition; it will be a "completely different person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] Shift in Power Dynamics
> The order for Putin's arrest from the Hague International Criminal Court and Xi Jinping's visit have not altered plans for a successor but underscore the growing necessity for survival among groups close to the Russian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:04">[00:29:04]</a>. This need to survive after Putin's departure will break loyalties and long-standing friendships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>.

The speaker acknowledges that initial [[prospects_for_democracy_in_russia | changes in Russia]] will be for the worse, and the country has "not yet reached the bottom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Despite the current difficulties, there is a strong belief that "victory will be ours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>. Financial support for these efforts is framed as an investment in a "better, free, fair, and prosperous Russia" for future generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:58">[00:40:58]</a>.

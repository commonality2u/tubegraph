Recent geopolitical events highlight shifting dynamics between Russia and its allies, including Belarus.

## Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) Summit
At a Collective Security Treaty Organization (DKB/CSTO) summit, where [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | President Putin]] participated, the final declaration was notably refused by Armenia's Pashinyan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This refusal indicated Armenia's disillusionment with the organization, suggesting a likely departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Reports also suggest other member countries wish to leave the CSTO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

Photographs from the summit captured a "sanitary distance" around [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Putin]], with other leaders appearing to avoid close proximity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. This observed distance followed the European Parliament's resolution labeling Russia as a "terrorist state" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Although the resolution itself has no immediate practical consequences, it significantly impacts Russia's reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The instinctive reaction from Russia's neighbors, previously considered loyal allies, suggests a fear of reputational and potential economic or sanctions-related repercussions from being associated with Russia's leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Death of Vladimir Makei and its Implications
A significant and tragic event was the sudden death of Vladimir Makei, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. While officially attributed to a heart attack, reliable sources suggest it was a murder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

Makei was reportedly killed because he was a "too successful negotiator" in establishing communication between [[Russias strategy and relations with Belarus | Belarusian leadership]] and Western countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. During these negotiations, Belarus had indicated a willingness to make political concessions to restore relations with the West <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Furthermore, [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] had hinted at impending changes in Russia that would lead to a more democratic path for Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

Makei's murder effectively "blocked" this diplomatic track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. As a successful negotiator with strong Western connections and a trusted confidant of [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]], his death is interpreted as a "Black mark" or a warning to the [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Belarusian president]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. It is seen as a clear message about the consequences for those who consider refusing Russia's "close brotherly embrace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. This event underscores the challenges [[political_dynamics_involving_putin_and_lukashenko | Lukashenko]] faces in attempting to distance Belarus from [[Russias strategy and relations with Belarus | Russian leadership and its policies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

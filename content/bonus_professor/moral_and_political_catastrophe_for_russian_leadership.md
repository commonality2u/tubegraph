The withdrawal of Russian troops from Kherson marks a "moral and political catastrophe" for the Russian leadership and nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This event is perceived as a strategic turning point that has consolidated in Ukraine's favor, shifting the strategic initiative to Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Consequences for Russian Leadership and Establishment

The loss of Kherson, while not a military catastrophe, signifies a profound psychological and political defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Loss of Faith in Victory** The Russian establishment has lost faith in achieving victory, now having to accept the inevitability of military defeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Putin as a "Toxic Loser"** In the eyes of the establishment, Putin has become a "toxic loser," with everything he touches turning into something "directly opposite to gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Propaganda Confusion** There is notable confusion within the propaganda machine, which is at a loss for how to address the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. While this confusion is expected to be overcome, it will likely lead to tightened censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Search for a Way Out** The situation has intensified the search for a solution to the impasse created by the "brilliant actions of the supreme commander-in-chief" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **Elite Discontent** There is a noticeable increase in discontent among the elite, which poses a fundamental threat to Vladimir Putin's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Peace Proposals

A peace proposal was received by the Russian leadership immediately after the withdrawal from Kherson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The outline of these proposals, which were agreed upon with Ukraine, includes several key points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>:
*   **Territorial Withdrawal** Russia is to completely withdraw from Ukrainian territory, including the DPR and LPR, but excluding Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Crimea's Status** Crimea would receive an indefinite status for seven years, during which negotiations would take place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Crimea must be demilitarized, and the Black Sea Fleet must leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Demilitarized Zone** A 100-kilometer deep demilitarized zone must be established along the border of Russia with Ukraine and the Belarusian border with Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Heavy weapons from Russia are to be removed from this zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   **Ukraine's Commitments** In return, Ukraine promises not to join NATO for seven years and not to raise questions about joining the alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Transnistria** The Russian military base in Transnistria is to be moved to Russia, and Russia will not interfere with Transnistria's integration into Moldova in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   **Immunity for Officials** A crucial element causing potential readiness in the [[current_political_climate_and_leadership_in_russia | Russian establishment]] to accept the treaty is the guarantee that Russian civilians, military, and political figures will not be subject to punishment, ensuring their freedom, security, and preservation of at least some assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. However, scapegoats are expected to be punished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   **Reparations** Financial compensation for damage to Ukraine was not mentioned in the received materials but should be discussed during negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Russia will not use the term "reparations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Indirect Signs of Kremlin's Seriousness

Several indirect signs suggest the Russian leadership is taking these peace proposals seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>:
*   **Tactical Nuclear Weapon Plans** Plans for the use of tactical nuclear weapons were curtailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Erdogan's Mediation Efforts** Turkish President Erdogan announced his intention to meet with Putin to discuss peace prospects with Ukraine, followed by a visit or call to Zelensky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
*   **Avoidance of Massive Energy Strikes** If Russia refrains from inflicting another massive blow to Ukraine's energy infrastructure, it would be a third indirect sign of seriousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

It is noted that taking proposals seriously does not equate to immediate acceptance; the Kremlin might seek to gain time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Internal Political Dynamics

The [[public_dissatisfaction_and_political_implications_in_russia | public dissatisfaction]] in Russia is not expected to become a significant force unless it unites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. The Kremlin only considers force and is ready to reckon with public opinion if society imposes its viewpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. The speaker believes that only citizens of Russia can influence the [[impact_of_leadership_changes_on_russian_political_climate | process of changing]] the political system and punishing the guilty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

## Accountability and Blame

The search for the guilty will begin within Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
*   **Military** The military will be blamed for Russia's defeat, but only after a peace treaty is signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>.
*   **"Turbo-Patriots"** Initially, the "turbo-patriots" who vocally supported the conflict and now criticize the authorities, such as Igor Strelkov and Aleksandr Dugin, are expected to face repression and intimidation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. There is a possibility that a new political party for these "turbo-patriots" could be created as a "false political target" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:24">[00:19:24]</a>.
*   **Censorship** Censorship is expected to be intensified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

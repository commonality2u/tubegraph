Valery Solovyov's 44th program, recorded on December 18 and airing December 19, 2022, discusses the anticipated resumption of [[mobilization in Russia and potential nationwide mobilization | mobilization]] and the introduction of elements of martial law in the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This aligns with a broader strategy to transform Russia into a "military camp" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Indications of Future Mobilization and Martial Law

Signs suggest an upcoming [[second_stage_of_mobilization_in_russia | second stage of mobilization]] and the expansion of martial law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. Predictions indicate that the [[second_stage_of_mobilization_in_russia | second stage of mobilization]] would likely begin after the winter holidays, possibly in a "gentle form" like document verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. Evidence from social networks shows people receiving invitations to military enlistment offices for document verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.

A recent scandal involved Lieutenant Colonel Fotin, a Moscow region military commissar, stating that the term of military service would increase from one year to one and a half years starting in spring 2023, and potentially to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Although this information was quickly disseminated and met with official denials, it is suggested that Fotin merely stated what military commissars already know and are preparing for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This preparation includes the [[second_stage_of_mobilization_in_russia | second stage of mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

The [[second_stage_of_mobilization_in_russia | second stage of mobilization]] is expected to be more massive than the initial partial [[mobilization process in Russia | mobilization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

## Elements of Martial Law

The expansion of martial law to the entire territory of Russia, or a significant part of it, is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. Measures may include:
*   **Travel restrictions:** Restrictions on travel abroad from the Russian Federation and even movement between its subjects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. This has already been observed with orders prohibiting Rostec and Rosneft employees, and their families, from leaving the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. Top management of Rosneft is even recommended not to leave Moscow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. This is seen as a test or actual introduction of martial law elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>.
*   **Mobilization economy:** The logical step following martial law would be a mobilization economy where individuals are attached to their workplaces, unable to quit or move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
*   **Asset redistribution:** Assets from "wrong" oligarchs, those critical of the state or unwilling to surrender capital for the war effort, would be transferred to the state or "right" patriotic oligarchs who have suffered losses from sanctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. While there are no current plans for nationalization of small and medium-sized businesses, this could change at the regional level, where security agencies might seize profitable enterprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## Ideological Pumping and Public Response

The concept of a "people's war" proposed by a presidential administration head could become central to agitation and propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. However, recent sociology indicates that traditional propaganda efforts are not working as intended, or even negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. TV viewers have reportedly stopped watching propaganda talk shows, opting for entertainment content instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:40">[00:20:40]</a>. People are tired of the hysteria from official propagandists and want to forget about the conflict in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.

A Mediascope study found that only one propaganda talk show ("60 Minutes" with Skabeeva and Popov) was in the top 100 most popular TV programs for the week, while others, like "Evening with Vladimir Solovyov," were absent from the rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. In contrast, in October, five propaganda talk shows were in the top 100, and Solovyov was in seventh place in July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>. This suggests that television may struggle to convey the concept of a "people's war" effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>.

## Poverty and Repression

The ongoing situation exacerbates poverty, with 70% of Russian citizens reducing their expenses in the third quarter of the year, saving on clothes, dining out, household items, vacations, and new electronics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>. There is a clear indication that society is becoming poorer, with plans to buy fewer and cheaper New Year's gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. Even those with money are saving it, anticipating a "real black day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:47">[00:24:47]</a>.

Authorities are reportedly issuing preliminary orders to security forces to "mercilessly suppress" women's protests, reflecting a stance of "do not fire blanks, do not spare the bullets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:52">[00:22:52]</a>. It is asserted that Putin is "fighting the poor" by mobilizing them, leading to their disappearance in the "fog of war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

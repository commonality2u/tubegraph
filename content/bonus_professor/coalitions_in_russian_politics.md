[[russian_internal_political_dynamics | Russian internal political dynamics]] are significantly shaped by the interplay of powerful elite coalitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The primary struggle is between two major groups: the Chemezov coalition and the Patrushev coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, which remain the dominant forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This conflict, alongside the involvement of other elite groups, defines the core of [[domestic_russian_political_dynamics | domestic Russian politics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Both are described as opposing coalitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

## Key Coalitions and Their Dynamics

### Patrushev Coalition
The Patrushev coalition is headed by Nikolai Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Prime Minister Candidate**: Dmitry Patrushev was the initial candidate for Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> and was considered the heir to the "President Putin" (who is described as a double) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Political Role**: The coalition's plans for Dmitry Patrushev to become Prime Minister and then President encountered strong resistance from the Chemezov coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Current Status**: Dmitry Patrushev became a simple Vice-Premier, not the First Vice-Premier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. While his apparatus weight grew, the coalition's position in the socio-economic part of the government "worsened somewhat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Nikolai Patrushev maintains complete control over the security forces despite stepping back from the Security Council secretary position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. He holds all threads of influence, especially over security forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Future Prospects**: As part of a compromise, Nikolai Patrushev was promised that Dmitry Patrushev would become the new Prime Minister by the end of 2024, with his transformation into president possibly occurring in early 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Chemezov Coalition
The Chemezov coalition is a major player in [[power_struggles_and_elite_coalitions_in_russia | elite power struggles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Prime Minister Candidate**: Denis Manturov was the Chemezov coalition's candidate for Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Opposition to Patrushev**: The Chemezov coalition categorically opposed Dmitry Patrushev becoming Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Current Status**: Denis Manturov became the First Vice-Premier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. The Chemezov coalition's position in the socio-economic part of the government "improved somewhat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. The coalition found the acceptance of Mishustin's candidacy important as it delayed the prospect of Patrushev's nomination for president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## Political Figures and Their Roles

*   **Mikhail Mishustin**: Appointed Prime Minister of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. His appointment was not predetermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> and resulted from an "intense, extremely sharp struggle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. China advocated for his appointment because he personally pleased Xi Jinping and promised to fulfill all obligations to China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Mishustin's appointment was a condition for the Chinese to agree to a visit by the "so-called president" (Putin's double) to Beijing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. His position is seen as weakened, as the real fight for influence in the government will be between Manturov and Dmitry Patrushev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.

*   **Dmitry Patrushev**: Nikolai Patrushev's candidate for Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> and potential heir to "President Putin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Now a Vice-Premier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Expected to become Prime Minister by the end of 2024 and then President in early 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

*   **Denis Manturov**: Chemezov's coalition candidate for Prime Minister <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Now the First Vice-Premier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

*   **Nikolai Patrushev**: Main figure of the Patrushev coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. While no longer Secretary of the Security Council, he continues to lead the security forces from "behind the scenes" and maintains complete control over the security lobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. His shift to the shadows was part of a compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

*   **Sergei Shoigu**: Former Minister of Defense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. His arrest was anticipated by some plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. He became the Secretary of the Security Council <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>, a role described as an "absolute void" because all actual affairs will be handled by Nikolai Patrushev's first deputy, Nurgaliev <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. His removal as Minister of Defense was highly probable, though not a foregone conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>, and a purge of his deputies was expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.

*   **Andrei Belousov**: Appointed Minister of Defense instead of Shoigu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

*   **Anton Vaina**: Head of the Presidential Administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Was considered a compromise candidate for Prime Minister but refused the offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

*   **Alexey Dyumin**: Governor of Tula Oblast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Appeared as a compromise candidate for Prime Minister in the "last days" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. He was considered a compromise figure for some time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

## Recent Political Developments
The program, aired on May 13, focuses on the aftermath of the recent changes in the Russian government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The appointments were a result of an "extremely sharp struggle" between the elite groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>.

*   **Previous Predictions**: The speaker's analytical descriptions and predictions regarding the sharp increase in turbulence due to the new government's formation and the prominence of the Chemezov and Patrushev coalitions came true by 85-90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Government Formation**: Nothing about the new government's formation was predetermined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Prime Minister Selection**: An agreement in late November suggested Dmitry Patrushev would become Prime Minister, leading to a 75-80% renewal of the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. However, by mid-February, the Patrushev coalition's plans met "insurmountable resistance" from the Chemezov coalition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This created a stalemate where both major candidates (Dmitry Patrushev and Denis Manturov) were blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Compromise Options**: Anton Vaina, a security official, and Alexey Dyumin were considered as compromise candidates for Prime Minister before Mishustin's appointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Chinese Influence**: China played a decisive role in Mishustin's appointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This influence has caused "very strong irritation" among the Russian elite, who understand Russia's critical dependence on China militarily and economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.
*   **"Rotten Compromise"**: The current arrangement is termed a "rotten compromise" that no one considers long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. It includes both Denis Manturov (from Chemezov's coalition) as First Vice-Premier and Dmitry Patrushev (from Nikolai Patrushev's coalition) as a Vice-Premier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. This compromise also includes the understanding that Dmitry Patrushev will become Prime Minister by the end of 2024 and then President <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
*   **Turbulence**: The current political situation is marked by a sharp increase in turbulence, which is expected to intensify, potentially leading to bloodshed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a>. The struggle between the two main coalitions is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   **Institutional Weight**: The speaker emphasizes that the official hierarchy and institutions in the Russian Federation hold little importance compared to the real weight of individuals in the political world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

Valery Solovey presents the 25th episode of "Answers to Hot Questions" on Thursday, July 13th. This episode addresses questions posed by viewers on a previous video [00:00:29].

## Current Operations and Future Outlook

### Official Statements and Reality
A previously stated meeting between Putin and Prigozhin, along with Wagner commanders, on June 29 was denied. The speaker confirms there was no such meeting planned or held, despite the Kremlin's press secretary Peskov's statement [00:01:03]. The Kremlin reportedly intends to present "fake documents" including photos and video, depicting a staging with Putin's double and Wagner commanders from behind [00:01:21].

### Ministerial Functions
The [[Russian Foreign Policy and Military Strategy | Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] currently serves a "decorative function" and is primarily a "foreign policy department for propaganda" [00:09:24]. It is noted that the Ministry does not perform most of the tasks it "needs to do" [00:09:33].

### Military Capabilities and Strategy
The potential of the [[russian_military_strategy_and_challenges | Russian Armed Forces]] and the Russian defense industry should not be underestimated, as this potential is "gradually being used" [00:15:25]. If the Ukrainian offensive is defeated, the [[russian_military_operations_in_ukraine | Russian Armed Forces]] possess the "technical possibility" to launch a counteroffensive [00:15:13].

### Future of the Conflict with Ukraine
Regarding forces that plan to come to power after Putin, some are "ready to quickly end the war" with Ukraine, while others are not [00:10:41]. Similarly, some forces are prepared to quickly complete the "operation in Ukraine," while others will "reflect" [00:24:15].

One perspective suggests that if security forces come to power, they might escalate "special operations" to improve their negotiation position [00:14:38]. However, the speaker clarifies that this is a "possibility," not a certainty, and is based on the idea that negotiating peace with Ukraine might require a position of "strength" or "success" [00:14:55].

A "fake document" was shown by Putin to presidents of African countries, which he claimed was a signed peace treaty with Ukraine [00:17:56]. This document, dated April, was described as "fiction" and a "falsification," as negotiations were held in March [00:18:13].

Andrey Kosmoch's prediction of an "impressive" Ukrainian counteroffensive in the summer and "the end of Putin in the fall of this year" is discussed [00:24:30]. The speaker notes that the counteroffensive is underway and its "scale will grow," but while a positive outcome for Ukraine is predicted, it is "not yet visible" [00:24:43]. The speaker also suggests that "everything will come true" regarding the "end of Putin" [00:25:06].

### Relations with Ukraine
Friendship between Russia and Ukraine is unlikely in the future [00:25:25]. However, "pragmatic relations can well be built and quite quickly," an event expected to occur "in our lifetime" [00:25:30].

### Regional Issues
The future of South Ossetia and Abkhazia will be decided after the [[russian_political_analysis | political crisis in Russia]] ends [00:26:42]. This resolution will involve "rather difficult political negotiations" with "all interested parties" and is unlikely to be resolved quickly [00:26:48].

Viktor Medvedchuk is mentioned in relation to the possibility of him being used in the parts of Ukraine now referred to as "new territories," though this plan is "not working out very well" [00:26:04]. Money was allocated to him for this purpose [00:26:15].

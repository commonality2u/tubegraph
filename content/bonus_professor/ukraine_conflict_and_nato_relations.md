This article discusses the [[russia_ukraine_conflict | Ukraine conflict]] and its implications for [[potential_involvement_of_nato_in_the_conflict | NATO relations]], as observed in July 2022.

## Key Events and Outcomes

The two main international events of the past week were the G7 meeting and the NATO summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Key outcomes included:
*   Russia was designated as an enemy of the military alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   A decision was made to deploy 300,000 rapid deployment forces to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   NATO promised unlimited aid and support to [[foreign_policy_and_relations_with_ukraine | Ukraine]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   Sweden and Finland were included in NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Shift in International Relations

These developments indicate a shift towards a new "Cold War" situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Unlike the previous Cold War, which involved proxy wars but avoided direct clashes in the European theater of military operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, [[ukraine_russia_conflict_analysis | Ukraine]] has become a direct "field of conflict" between Russia and NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This situation is likened to [[ukraine_russia_conflict_analysis | Ukraine]] turning into "European Africa or Latin America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, a "bitter reality" from which Ukrainians are suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

## Avoiding a Second Front

Efforts are being made to avoid opening a "second front in Europe," especially one that could directly involve a military alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. For example, Brussels is reportedly pressuring Lithuania to resolve the issue of transit through the Kaliningrad region in favor of the Russian Federation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This is despite public solidarity from Great Britain and the United States with Lithuania's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The speaker believes that Brussels will likely accept transit conditions favorable to Russia to prevent another front from opening on the European continent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Russian Military Operation and Goals

As of July 3, 2022, Russia's Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu reported that Russian armed forces had taken full control of the Luhansk region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This achievement, four and a half months into the conflict, is described as a tactical success but not a "breakthrough" or "strategic coup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The slow advance of Russian forces is seen as reducing the political claims of the Kremlin and Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

The stated goal of the "special military operation" has reportedly shifted from "denazification" and "demilitarization of [[foreign_policy_and_relations_with_ukraine | Ukraine]]" to "liberating Donbass and guaranteeing the security of the Russian Federation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Despite initial aims to push NATO back to 1997 borders, the length of the border of contact between NATO and the Russian Federation has nearly doubled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Strategic Trap

The Kremlin is seen as "step by step" being drawn into a "strategic trap" by continuously increasing its efforts to overcome the resistance of [[foreign_policy_and_relations_with_ukraine | Ukraine]] and the international community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This continued escalation is depleting Russia's material, human (anthropological), and moral/psychological resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. As a result, while the world moves forward, Russia is regressing on a path of social, technological, and economic degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

## Internal Mobilization in Russia

The Russian government has appealed to the State Duma for amendments to federal law, which would allow the introduction of "special measures in the sphere of the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. These measures would prohibit firms, organizations, and enterprises, regardless of ownership, from refusing government military orders and contracts related to armed actions outside Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This move is compared to the Soviet era where the economy was largely connected to servicing the military-industrial complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Additionally, these special measures would permit authorities to change contract terms during implementation and interfere with labor relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This could mean employees being forced to work nights, weekends, holidays, and without vacations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This is reminiscent of the situation in the Soviet Union on the eve of June 1941 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. The government's actions suggest a simplification, pressure, and even "cruelty" as the regime transitions towards a mobilization economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

Valery Soloviev dedicated the 25th episode of his program to analyzing the failures experienced by Russia, particularly focusing on the recent SCO summit in Samarkand, Uzbekistan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:33">[01:47:33]</a>. He categorized these failures into four main aspects: image/symbolic, geopolitical, economic, and physiological <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>.

## Image and Symbolic Failure

At the SCO summit, the way Russian President Putin was received and perceived demonstrated a significant decline in Russia's international standing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Reception Disparity**: Unlike previous instances where other leaders waited for Putin, he was met only by the Prime Minister of Uzbekistan, while the Uzbek President met other heads of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:18">[03:05:18]</a>.
*   **Waiting Game**: Putin was observed waiting for leaders from India, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and Kyrgyzstan before bilateral talks, a reversal of his past practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:26">[03:30:26]</a>.
*   **Visual Representation**: A photograph from the meeting showed President Erdogan and Azerbaijani President Aliyev seated prominently, while Putin was positioned on a sofa between the very tall Presidents Lukashenko and Tajikistan's Rahmon, which was interpreted as a symbolic placement by the summit organizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:23">[03:50:23]</a>.
*   **Challenging Exchanges**:
    *   The Prime Minister of India, Narendra Modi, adopted a didactic tone with Putin, stating that "this is not the era of war," to which Putin appeared to make excuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:02">[04:31:02]</a>.
    *   Chinese President Xi Jinping reportedly showed an "ironic grin" and "shook his head with obvious distrust" when Putin offered a "cheerful" but unconvincing answer about the situation in Ukraine, claiming "Everything is going according to plan" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:08">[04:43:08]</a>.

## Geopolitical Failure

The summit highlighted a significant shift in geopolitical influence, particularly in the post-Soviet space traditionally seen as Russia's domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:15">[05:17:15]</a>.
*   **Rising Influence of China and Turkey**: China and Turkey are actively expanding their influence in Central Asia, an area the Kremlin once considered its "undivided" sphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:15">[05:26:15]</a>.
*   **China's Guarantees**: Chinese President Xi Jinping publicly stated in Astana that China is the guarantor of Kazakhstan's sovereignty and territorial integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:11">[06:02:11]</a>.
*   **Kazakhstan's Distance**: The President of Kazakhstan demonstratively avoided communication with Putin at the summit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:08">[06:38:08]</a>. Kazakhstan has also indicated it will suspend its membership in the CSTO from next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:59">[09:00:59]</a>.
*   **Shifting Alliances**: The conflict between Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan initially did not turn to Moscow for mediation, with Putin only later offering his services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:33">[06:54:33]</a>.
*   **Armenia and Karabakh**: During renewed clashes between Armenia and Azerbaijan, Russia's support for Armenia was conditional on joining a "union state," excluding Karabakh, leading to Pashinyan's refusal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:26">[07:36:26]</a>. Moscow is not acting as a reliable mediator, and the CSTO is expected to collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:16">[08:46:16]</a>.
*   **US Influence in the South Caucasus**: The United States is now seen as an alternative to Russian influence in the Greater South Caucasus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:04">[09:47:04]</a>.

## Economic Failure

At the summit, Putin had little to offer participants beyond raw resources, having lost influence and military aid capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:33">[09:57:33]</a>.
*   **China's Disinterest**: When Putin proposed building the "Power of Siberia 2" gas pipeline from Yamal through Mongolia to China, Xi Jinping "shook his head ironically," indicating China has no need for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:13">[10:21:13]</a>.
*   **Deteriorating [[economic_conditions_in_russia | Economic Conditions in Russia]]**: The speaker predicts a sharp deterioration in socio-political conditions this fall, which will inevitably affect the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:40:48">[25:40:48]</a>. He states that "Finances in general are nationally expensive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:21">[26:01:21]</a>.

## Physiological Failure (Putin's Health)

Attendees at the summit observed President Putin's "terrible physical and mental shape" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:16">[10:46:16]</a>.
*   **Physical Frailty**: A mini-video reportedly showed Erdogan, who himself is ill with diabetes, carefully supporting Putin's elbow to help him keep pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:15">[10:56:15]</a>.
*   **Inability to Cope with Stress**: Summit loads are no longer physically or mentally possible for the Russian president <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:37">[11:15:37]</a>.
*   **Medical Presence**: A prior message noted that 12 doctors waited for Putin at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.
*   **Cognitive Decline**: Observers noted "strange statements" and a peculiar manner from Putin, suggesting "something in the head of the Russian president" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:11">[11:47:11]</a>.
*   **Elite Awareness**: The speaker claims that security officers, like Patrushev and Bortnikov, who objected to mobilization, are the first to react to the president's political and physiological weakening, as they "know better than others what is happening to him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:13:30">[18:13:30]</a>.

The overall sentiment among the Russian elite is a desire for Putin to "suddenly disappear somewhere" to take all responsibility for current events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:22">[21:01:22]</a>. An assassination attempt on Putin was reported, interpreted as a "public warning" rather than a fatal swing, possibly hinting at demands from powerful forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:45:06">[22:45:06]</a>.
